b'' b'' b'the jets use the "breakaway pass" scheme to create a scoring sensation' b'in order to generate interest. if teams score as many or more goals' b'against winnipeg when selanne is on the ice as winnipeg scores when' b"he is on the ice then i can't see how his contribution can be described" b'as impressive.' b'' b'implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne' b'on the ice can be blamed on him...roger, he is a forward. winnipeg has a' b"lousy defensive record anyway. let's put it another way. john cullen's b"is terrible. what's your excuse for him? that his powerplay points don't" b"count? neither do selanne's..." b'' b'the object of the game is not to feed selanne it is' b'to win. and feeding selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way' b'to winning.' b'' b'knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that' b'feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to' b'winning.' b'' b"pat burns wouldn't have a goal suck like this on his team." b'' b"you're worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team?" b'' b"we don't know what selanne does best. we do know what jet's management" b'wants. and again, the object of the exercise is not to allow selanne to' b'do what he does best, it is to win hockey games.' b'' b'what he does best is score...so i refer you to my comment above.' b'' b'as it is now, selanne' b'is a grandstanding goal suck. did you see the way he parades around' b'with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal? you would think the' b'messiah had returned...' b'' b"nope, didn't see it. i was too busy watching foligno jump up and down after" b'_his_ goal....' b'' b'' b''
