b'' b'one way to "mask" the left button check the contents of the xevent that the' b'xaddeventhandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the' b'show_mouse_position function.' b'' b'if the xevent arrive in this function as' b'' b'xevent p_event;' b'' b'then, the value of p_event-xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. so,' b'you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. in case' b'it was not clear p_event-xevent.button is an int.' b'' b'by the way, you mentioned the button1motionmask and if anyone can help me with' b'these motionmasks i would be grateful. i can not figure out how do distinguish' b'between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. in' b'essence i would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button.' b'unfortunately, the xevent sent by a motionmask does not seem to contain the' b'value of the pressed button.' b'' b'any ideas,' b'eps'
