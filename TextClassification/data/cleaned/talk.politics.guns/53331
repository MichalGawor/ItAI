b'' b'' b'' b'||\twrong again, but if you want proof: turn on your tv and look' b'||for a show starring chuck connors. it was called, "the rifleman."' b'||time how fast he can fire that old lever-action rifle.' b'' b'|believe it or not, i remember seeing an advertisement for someone' b'|selling one of these; apparently winchester produced a bunch of' b'|these commercially to commemorate the television show. i believe it was' b'|being sold as a handgun because of the barrel length and lack of a stock.' b'' b'i might be mistaking the above weapon for the gun used by steve' b'mcqueen in "wanted: dead or alive." if so, sorry. did winchester' b'make any commemorative models of the rifle used by chuck connors' b'in the movie? chuck connors was an nra member before he died recently...' b'' b"i don't know for sure if winchester made any commemeratives. if i" b'recall correctly, the rifle itself was a model with an' b"oversized loop lever. i don't think winchester makes this rifle" b'any more. rossi make a model look-alike in special and' b'.357 magnum.' b'' b'aaron'
