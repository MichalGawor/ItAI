b'' b'like many others i too was watching the caps/isles game when the went' b'to the baseball game. i too was pissed. how could they interupt such' b'an important game. i understand about contracts, but you would think they' b'would have a clause in the contract concerning important games!' b'anyway, us blues (and hawks) fans got shafted worse! while everyone' b'in the u.s. and watched the game on abc. however those of us who live in' b'the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus(?)' b'telethon. the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get' b'to see the game except through hawk vision. this game, had it been' b'televised, would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area' b'since this television bull*&%$ has got to stop. we are not only' b'being deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, but' b'we are also being deprived of watching them on tv.' b'peace,' b'hammer' b''
