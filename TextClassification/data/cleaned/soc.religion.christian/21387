b'' b'' b'could anyone enlighten me on how the mormon church views' b"children born out of wedlock? in particular i'm interested to know if any" b"stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents. i'm especially" b'keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the mormon faith on' b'bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical' b'book the mormons keep in salt lake city. if this is an issue on which the' b'"official" position has changed over time, i\'m interested in learning both old' b'and new beliefs. e-mail or posting is fine. all information or pointers are' b'appreciated.' b'' b'elliotte rusty harold\t\tdepartment of mathematics'
