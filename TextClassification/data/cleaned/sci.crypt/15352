b'' b'' b'with all the talk about this clipper chip, i have developed one question...' b'' b'how does it work???' b'' b'if you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? does the' b'other party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to' b'undo it? do i use a different method for calling one party than i would for' b"another?. if the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someone" b'else could also? i assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use' b'would be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. this seems' b'like a fundamental question to me, but i have very little experience with' b'cryptosystems, other than des. if someone could give me an explanation as' b'to how it would be used (remember that i have had little experience with' b'this sort of thing) it would be very much appreciated.' b'' b'justin york'
