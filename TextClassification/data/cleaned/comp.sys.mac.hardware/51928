b'' b'' b'i have a lightening scan pro hand scanner. it came with scanning/editing' b'software, ocr software, and some plug-in modules for photoshop et al. the' b'scanner was a tad on the pricey side but the scans are incredibly' b'accurate, in level, dpi grayscale. it also has dithered and line art' b"settings when grayscale isn't desired. great scanning software, easy to use. i" b'frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image' b'in the note. hope this helps!'
