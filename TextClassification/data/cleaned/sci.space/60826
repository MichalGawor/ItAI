b'' b'allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow' b"down. the idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without" b'expending fuel, we\'ll just find the trajectory that makes it possible". the' b"originator of the technique said that nasa wasn't interested, but that japan" b"was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for" b'deceleration.' b'' b"actually, hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all," b"so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand. the lunar-orbit mission was" b'an afterthought, after hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by hiten' b'during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion' b"into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed." b'' b'it should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages. it takes' b'a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.' b'if you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have' b'to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from' b"what you'd need for the brute-force approach." b'--'
