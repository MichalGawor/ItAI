b'' b'| /i guess thats why there are so many new dos and os/2 applications' b'| /coming and hardly any windows apps coming out? (irony)' b'| b'| yep, the os/2 apps are comming, the os/2 apps are comming.' b'| b'| yet another micro-minion hoping that if he says something long enough,' b'| b'| hey, i remember the good old days running os/2 alpha with brief,' b'| excel, word, and a couple internal apps (product support database' b'| client, os/2-based email front-end). life was good. but it was also' b"| impractical 'cause the masses were using windows and my job was to help" b'| the masses.' b'' b'apparently you prefer os/2 to windows or at least did;' b'' b'to windows yes.' b'' b'by you last comment' b'do you mean that your knowledge of os/2 is dated (it must be) or argue' b'' b"it's definitely dated i used os/2 alpha (when msft was" b'developing it...)' b'' b"i suspect that the masses were using windows because they couldn't afford" b'to use os/2, can you say as much for nt?' b'' b'i preferred windows because it was more stable faster than b'but could still run more apps than os/2 (again i made this choice' b'before was released).' b'' b'but getting back to the original question, do you have any data on the' b'relative avaliablity or windows applications versus os/2 applications' b'or any evidence that stated support will be dropped by any of the above?' b'' b"no, i've seen no such data." b'' b'| grow up. other companies are supporting os/2. make points please.' b'|' b'| if you see life in terms of debating points, i think you need' b'| to grow up.' b'' b'ah yes i remember the days when we kids would engage in orderly debate,' b'but our parents would usually find out and force us to act in the more' b'mature manner of heaping invective and casting rocks and dirt clods.' b'' b'hee hee. good one b'' b"| it doesn't help microsoft" b'| to have employees (i assume you are, due to the org, may be wrong) saying' b'| such trivial things on the net.' b'|' b'| so?' b'| microsoft employs over employees. walking into this place is' b'| not like walking into the commercial. there are individuals' b"| here. you think they'll all talk the same way, say the same thing," b'| and "help microsoft" all the time? if so, why?' b'' b'it appears to me that he is voicing his frustration to an attitude' b'he has encountered before.' b'' b"...and one that i've encountered as well..." b'' b'i on the other hand have had no such' b'experience other than from reading this thread. you at microsoft' b'are in a unique position to present facts,' b'' b"hmm. are you sure? i'm speaking from my own experience as an" b'os/2 _user_. certainly people in, say, the nt marketing group' b'would be in a unique position to present the results of, say,' b'research on upcoming nt and os/2 apps (vs windows and ms-dos apps).' b'part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does' b'not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).' b'' b'but prefer to make baseless claims or attack to poster. i must' b'make the same conclusion as he.' b'' b'i will confess to, at times, attacking the poster.' b'' b"| usenet accounts are not restricted to the marketroids. they're" b'| open to any fulltimer, and are primarily for recreational purposes.' b'| yeah, some of us are likely to answer a question or hop into a' b'| debate. or make stupid comments. you know, like human beings?' b'' b"i'm sorry this newsgroup is only for opressed hackers and stranded" b'extraterrestrials, not humans. how about alt.microsoft.humans? you' b'seem to discount others anyway.' b'' b'again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to "sell"' b'readers on our products (which would conflict with the "no-ads"' b'philosophy of usenet). nor do we necessarily have access to info' b'that others have.' b'' b'i also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,' b'members of the borg.' b'' b'-jen' b'' b'--' b''
