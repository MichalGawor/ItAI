b'' b'all of the arguments concerning the sabbath ought to make the point' b'pretty clear anyone outside of the catholic or orthodox oranglican or' b'monophysite churches ourght to worship on saturday if they are really' b'sola scriptura. otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by' b'the church, and only the above chruches really recognize any power of' b'the chruch to do so.' b'' b'andy byler' b'' b'[you will note that nothing in the faq said anything about the church' b'establishing or changing a law. the argument against the sabbath is' b'that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the' b'ceremonial law is not binding on christians. this argument is based' b"on paul's letters, acts, and in a more general sense, jesus'" b'teachings. further, most people argue that scripture shows worship' b'occuring on sunday, and paul endorsing it. i understand that these' b'points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more' b"time. the point i'm making here is not that these arguments are" b'right, but that the backing they claim is scripture.' b'' b'accepting the principle of "sola scriptura" does not commit us to' b"obeying the entire jewish law. acts and paul's letters are quite" b"clear on that. i think even the sda's accept it. the disagreement is" b'on where the bible would have us place the line.' b'' b'by the way, protestants do give authority to the church, in matters' b"that are not dictated by god. that's why churches are free to" b'determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc. if you accept that' b'the sabbath is not binding on christians, then the day of worship' b'falls into the category of items on which individual christians or' b'(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to' b'decide.' b'' b'--clh]'
