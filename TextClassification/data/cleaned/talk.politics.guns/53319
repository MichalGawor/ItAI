b'' b'this argument sounds very stupid.. if the ability to make guns from' b'"simple metalworking" was easy, then drug dealers would make their own' b"wouldn't they???.. why spend hundreds of dollars buying a gun that" b'somebody else made cheap and is selling it to you at an' b'exorbitant markup???... the simple truth of the matter is, that regardless' b'of how easy it is to make guns, banning guns will reduce the' b'the number of new guns and seriuosly impede the efforts of a' b'killer intent on buying a weapon....' b'to show why the tools argument is the silliest i have ever seen.. take an' b'analogy from computer science... almost every computer science major' b'can write a "wordprocessor" yet we(comp sci majors) would willingly pay b"to bucks for a professional software like wordperfect... why don't we" b'just all write our own software???...... because it is highly' b'inconvinient!!!..' b'same with guns... secondly.. how does one get this gunpowder for the' b'"home made gun" take a quick trip to the local 7-eleven???.' b' if guns were really that simple to make... the bosnian muslims would' b'be very happy people (or is it the case that metalworking tools are' b'banned in bosnia??? (deep sarcasm) b'' b'well this is my two cents..' b' i will now resume reading all these ridiculus post from people' b' who must make their living doing stand-up comedy.' b'** end of forwarded material b'' b'--' b'and so, the rubber spheroid arced beneath the brilliant lights.' b"headed for a hoop of dreams he'd dreamt of all those nights." b'the crowd gasped as the ball descended; would it grant their fondest wish?' b"there was no doubt in casey's mind, he knew it was a *swish*!"
