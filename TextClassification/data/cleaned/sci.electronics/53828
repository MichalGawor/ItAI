b'' b'yes, you increase the rpm slip of a "boxer" type fan by installing' b"a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply. the air flow of" b'small inch fans can be reduced by about by using a to b'uf capacitor. use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working' b'voltage rating around volts. note that some impriical study is' b'usually required to experimentally determine the best size' b'capacitor for a given application.' b'' b'for dc powered applications, try the radio shack volt box fan.' b'it can run and start reliably from as low as about vdc. it is' b'exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow. i wish i knew who' b'made the fans for radio shack.' b'' b'' b'--' b'bill mayhew neoucom computer services department' b'rootstown, oh usa phone:
