b'' b'reminds me of a great editorial by bruce reeve a couple months ago' b'in cycle canada.' b'' b'he was so pissed off with cops pulling over speeders in dangerous' b'spots (and often blind corners) that one day he decided to get' b'revenge.' b'' b'cruising on a factory loaner zzr1100 test bike, he noticed a cop' b'had pulled over a motorist on an on or off ramp with almost no' b"shoulder. being a bright lad, he hit his bike's kill switch" b'just before passing the cop, who happened to be bending towards' b'the offending motorist there-by exposing his glutes to the' b'passing world.' b'' b'with his ignition system now dead, he pumped his throtle two' b"or three times to fill his exhaust canister's with volatile raw fuel." b'' b'all it took was a stab at the kill switch to re-light the ignition' b"and send a flame in sargeant swell's direction." b'' b'i wonder if any cycle cops read cycle canada?' b'' b'\talthough i agree with the spirit of the action, i do hope that' b'the rider ponied up the or so it takes to replace the exhaust system' b"he just destroyed. the owner's manual explicitly warns against such" b'behavior for exactly that reason: you can destroy your muflers that way.' b'' b'one more good reason for straight pipes or megaphones;-)' b'' b'regards, charles' b'dod0.001' b'rz350' b'' b'ps: does anyone know if opti oils sells direct by the case load?' b'my loacl dealership is charging for a jug of injector oil,' b"and it's breaking me;-)" b'' b'--' b'within the span of the last few weeks i have heard elements of' b'separate threads which, in that they have been conjoined in time,' b'struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing' b'gourd. --unknown net.person'
