b'' b'' b'hi' b' i am thinking of upgrading to the beta version of windows nt on a 486sx 25mhz' b'213mb hard disc. can someone please give me there opion on such a setup for' b'running nt and is the operating system likely to be better than windows or' b"unix's." b'' b'' b'steve' b'' b"i've been using windows nt (tm) since the october release, and i have to" b'say that the march release is really a big improvement. windows nt (tm)' b'is becomming usable.' b'' b'there are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.' b'first (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed dos box.' b'what i mean is, i cannot (for instance) run falcon or any other' b'resourse intensive program in a dos box. it absolutley crawls.' b'and my machine is a with a 330mb hd and 16mb ram. if anyone' b'knows how to get a fast dos box (or full-screen for that matter),' b'please let me know.' b'' b'the second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.' b'for instance, my pas-16 has been demoted to running as a sound blaster' b"(which is natively supported nice), because mediavision hasn't" b'produced drivers yet.' b'' b'your disk should be large enough to keep an 80mb dos partition, and' b'give the rest over to windows nt (tm). the only thing is, whenever' b"you wanted to run windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into" b'windows nt (tm), instead of just typing win.' b'' b'windows nt (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal windows' b"though. it'd be a good choice if you have the resources. you should" b'really have *at least* 8mb ram though. one last thing, modems work' b"well enough, but i have yet to get my fax card to work, and i've never" b'heard of anyone else who did either.' b'' b"it's only better than unix because it runs killer software out of the" b"box, whereas with unix there isn't the same availablity." b'' b'i guess it comes down to windows nt (tm) is not yet for the faint' b"of heart, it's still a beta. but it's a very good beta." b'' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'redondo beach, ca \\______________________________________/"blah blah blah b'__________________|always store beer in a cool dark place|_____________________'
