'colour" b"defective vision and computer graphics displays', ieee computer graphics and" b'applications b'' b'you will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not' b'familiar with the cie xyz colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.' b'' b'i would like to write a program (probably a ppm filter) to allow' b'previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour' b'blind users. not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!' b'' b'yes this is certainly possible. you will need the chromaticities of the red' b'green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and' b'the chromaticity of the white point. this information can be measured, or' b'obtained from the manufacturer. i posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a' b'couple of weeks ago.' b'' b'the procedure, for each pixel is as follows. (some lookup tables might be a' b'help here.)' b'' b'a) convert rgb to cie xyz. this is a simple matrix multiplication once you' b'have the monitor data.' b"b) retaining the y component for later, convert xyz to chromaticity coordinates u'v'" b"using u' 4x/(x+15y+3z), v' 9y/(x+15y+3z)" b'c) find the equation of the line as in step above' b'd) find the intersection as in step b"e) convert back from u'v' to xyz, using the y value from step a" b'f) ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it' b'along a line in xyz space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and' b'white) until it is displayable.' b'' b'please email replies i will summarise and repost if there is' b'sufficient interest' b'' b'done; also posted for the rest of us.' b'' b'--' b'chris lilley' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'technical author, itti computer graphics and visualisation training project' b'computer graphics unit, manchester computing centre, oxford road,' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
