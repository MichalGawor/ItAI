b'' b'has anyone looked into the possiblity of a proton/centaur combo?' b'' b"i don't know a whole lot on proton, but given that it is a multi stage" b'rocket, up to stages, it may not really need the centaur, plus' b'it may end up seriously beating on said centaur.' b'' b'the proton has been used in and stage versions. the two stage version' b'was used for the first launches, while the and stage versions are used' b'today. the four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)' b'orbits, while the stage version is used for low earth orbits. since this is' b'the version that launched mir and the salyuts (and the add-on modules for mir),' b'as long as centaur is smaller than mir (which i believe it is), it should fit' b'under the shroud.' b'' b'i vaguely recall that the russians are developing a lh2/lox upper stage for the' b'proton.' b'--'
