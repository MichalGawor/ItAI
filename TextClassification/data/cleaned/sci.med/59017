b'' b' b' is there a right-eye dominance (eyedness?) as there is an' b' overall right-handedness in the population? i mean do most' b' people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the' b' other? if so, what kinds of percentages can be attached to this?' b' b' there is eye dominance same as handedness (and usually for the' b' same side). it has nothing to do with refractive error, however.' b'' b" i recall reading/seeing that former baseball star chris chambliss' hitting" b' abilities were (in part) attributed to a combination of left-handedness b' right-eye dominance.' b'' b'i was part of a study a few years ago at the university of arizona to' b'see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness' b'but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than' b'those with same side dominance of hand and eye. i was picked from' b'my softball class because i was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)' b'which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get' b'an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people). to' b'control the study, she used a pitching machine fast pitch. since' b"i was used to slow pitch, i didn't come close (actually i think" b'i foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball. if there were a lot of people' b"like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are" b'not used to hitting off a machine), i would seriously question the' b'results of that study!! i think there have been some studies of major' b'league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test' b'whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was "better" b"but i don't know the results. (the woman who ran the study i was in" b'said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major' b"leaguers than across the general population but i'm not sure" b"whether i'd believe her.)" b'' b'janice rathmann' b'' b'' b''
