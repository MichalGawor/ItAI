b'' b'with a little luck, i could own a c650 sometime in the near future, and' b'so i was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:' b'' b'1. what speed simms does the c650 need/want? (i know that it needs 80ns' b'vram...not sure for the main ram.)' b'' b'' b'60ns pin simms.' b'' b"2. i've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the" b"c650's ram...132 and megs. which is true? (perhaps another phrasing" b'would be better: does the meg version come with all megs on the logic' b'board, or megs a meg simm?)' b'' b'2 configs: 4mb 8mb. in each case the memory is soldered on the board' b'leaving the simm sockets open. 132mb is the total addressable memory for a' b'650.' b'' b'just wondering....' b'' b'' b'' b'michael a. mcguire, b'utcc user services'
