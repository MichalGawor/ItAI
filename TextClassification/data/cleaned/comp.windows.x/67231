b'' b' hi.' b'' b' i use emacs and i want to customize my keyboard better.' b' when i set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define-keys,' b" i can only access certain of the keys on my x-terminal's" b" keyboard. i can't get e.g. f10, home, end, pgup, pgdn; they all" b' seem to have either the same or no keycode. i have a feeling' b" this can't be fixed in emacs itself, but that i need to do some" b' xmodmap stuff. can someone help me?' b'' b'unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into' b'emacs. i ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to' b'change the source code so that all of these special keys generated' b'character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier' b'state as escape sequences for example, the sequence "esc b b'would indicate that the "home" key was pressed, with the shift key' b'down. you could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such' b'as "shift-return".' b'' b"if anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll" b'have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with' b'it a bit. basically you have to replace the keypress handling code' b'in the source file "x11term.c". maybe if someone at osf is' b"interested, i can send them the tweaks, but i imagine they've got" b'bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about' b"emacs v19!). if there's sufficient interest, i'll post the mods" b"somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it." b'' b'notes:' b'' b'* this special code will only apply if you let emacs create' b'its own (x11) window. if you run it in plain old tty mode (which' b"includes xterm windows) then it's business as usual." b'' b'* the patches i made were to version under sun os b'[i also did this a while back under hp-ux]. the patches are' b"in a chunk of code between '#if sun #endif' but could" b'easily be adapted for anything else.' b'' b'' b'+-------------------------------------------------------+------- b'+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\xx/
