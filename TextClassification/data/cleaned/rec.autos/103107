b'' b': consumer reports once wrote about the s-10 blazer that it "shook and rattled' b': like a tired taxi cab". there is one noise that is expecially irritating b': the back window squeaks. i believe its because the whole tailgate assembly' b': and window are not solid. anyway, has anyone had the same problem, and have' b': you found any fixes?' b':' b'' b"i can relate to this. i've tried everything on my greasing every point," b'wd40, etc. grease on the two cheap hinges on the tailgate seems to quiet it' b'down for a time, until the grease works out of the hinges. (hinge pins appear' b'to be made out of penny nails!)' b'' b'another vibration seems to get worse with age, and that is a vibration in the' b'transmission in 4th gear. my s10 has 59k miles on it. i bought it new, treated' b"it very easily, no fast off-road stuff. can't gm build chevies like they used" b'to? ford explorers look nice, until you look at the price.' b'' b'jim burrill'
