b'' b'greeting' b'' b'i am starting work on a project where i am trying to make strain gages' b'bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months. i am currently' b'using hydroxyapaptite back gages, and i have tried m-bonding the gages' b"to the bone. apart from those two application methods there doesn't" b'seem to be much else in the literature. i have only an engineering' b'background not medical or biological. i would be interest in any' b'ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone.' b'' b'thanks for oyur help in advance.' b'' b'terrance j dishongh' b'' b'it sounds as though you might want to try a product such as "super-glue".' b'the active ingredient is cynoacrylate, the same compound used to reconstruct' b'bones. i have successfully used superglue for a number of procedures on many' b'different species of animal. if you are simply trying to adhear something' b'to bone for several months, this would be ideal. it bonds almost immediatly,' b'is resistant to infection, and is non-irritating to surrounding tissue.' b'' b'phil bowman, manager' b'lab animal resources' b'university of montana' b'missoula, mt b':wg' b'' b'' b'--' b'' b'' b'/\\---/\\ phil bowman, manager' b'\\ laboratory animal resources'
