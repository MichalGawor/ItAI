b'' b'' b"i'm not sure about this but i hope the answer is that you can't apply under" b"the law of return. by conversion, you've elected not to be a part of the" b'jewish nation.' b'' b'which was my point. by converting to another religion i do not loose' b'my cultural identity, i just loose my religious identification.' b'' b'i disagree. by converting to another religion, you certainly' b'do change your cultural identity, and lose that part of you which was' b'jewish.' b'' b'' b'at the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world' b'that *you* do not consider yourself to be part of the jewish nation.' b'so, why should the jewish nation consider you to be a member?' b'' b'to be a part or not of the jeish nation is defined by my culture and not' b'by my religion. actually, if i am an atheist, which is in fact like' b'converting into a non-jewish in terms of religion, i am still considered as' b'part of the jewish nation.' b'' b'no, there is a serious cultural and religios difference' b'between renouncing the jewish god and accepting a new one. "thou' b'shall have no other gods before me." conversion is a violation of' b'this, atheism you might be able to wiggle around with.' b'' b'adam' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'"if we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we sure' b'wouldn\'t waste them on members of congress..." -john perry barlow'
