b'' b'' b'greetings,' b'we have a network of sun workstations, running sunos b"and openwindows of these are sun 3's that we have modified to" b"run seth robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into" b'xterminals. we use xdm (x11r4) to manage the displays.' b'' b'when we had xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when' b'we installed more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness.' b'with clients to sparc the sparc window manager is eventually' b'getting munged.' b'' b'let me try to be precise: the user sitting at the machine' b'that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having' b'control of his keyboard and screen yanked away. (when this was the' b'department chair, it was kind of cute). we poked at xdm for a few' b'days and are satisfied that it is not at fault. our current theory is' b'that olwm (the sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies' b'on one machine (which is what happens the console user runs olwm,' b'and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal' b'server).' b'' b'has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior?' b'can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory?' b'how about obvious gimmes?' b'and, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?' b'' b'any ideas are greatly appreciated.' b'' b'systems programmer and ta, tufts university computer science dept.' b'personal info: gcs/go d++ -p+ c+++ m*/m- s++/- g+ w+/w-- x+' b'email for explanation if interested...'
