b'' b'really, none of this stuff is especially hard. all you need for a true' b'private phone is an isdn codec, a vocoder (either a chip or' b'software), an encryptor (a chip is fine, but software is more than' b'fast enough), a v.32 or v.32bis modem module, and maybe a' b'microcontroller to run the whole thing. its easy to do, its cheap. and' b'any "normal" company trying to put one out will likely get a visit' b'from the boys in the dark suits from washington, just like qualcomm' b'did.' b'' b'have the feds shut down the people making sound blaster? what' b'about apple and next? apple, next, sun, and others make systems that' b'can handle cd-quality audio in and out, and can perform arbitrary' b'transformation on it in the process of transmitting it across a network' b'or modem.' b'' b"perhaps there's a market for a portable vocoder. not a crypto" b'device, simply an rs232<-voice converter. make it capable of recording' b'speech and playing it back simultaneously. it has applications for' b'multimedia, computing for the handicapped, internet talk radio, irc,' b"etc, etc, etc. it wouldn't be a cryptographic device at all but i" b'suppose someone could have it hooked to a laptop with a v.32bis' b"modem and some crypto software. i'd market the thing with an api for" b'text-to-speech using simple phonemes and the ability to use speech' b"samples. and, of course, i'd publish the interface to it so other" b'folks could write any applications they wanted to talk to the thing.' b'' b'mjr.'
