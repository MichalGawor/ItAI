b'' b' the batf needs more people, better weapons and more armored' b' transports. b'' b' with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with' b' mega fire power. they could of gone in there blasting and killed a few' b' women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn' b' to death days later.' b'' b'is this a joke? the legal way to serve a search warrant is to knock on' b'the door. tossing in a grenade to serve a search warrant violates the' b'us constitution and is hence, illegal. the bd complied with legal' b'search warrants in the past. i do not understand why the batf used an' b'illegal means to serve their search warrant last february.' b'' b'- steve kao'
