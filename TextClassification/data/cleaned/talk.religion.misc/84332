b'' b'if you check the news today, (ap) the "authorities also found a state-of-the-art' b'automatic machine gun that investigators did not know was in the cult\'s arsenal."' b'[carl stern, justice department]' b'' b'yeah. in a fire that reportedly burned hotter than degrees-- hot' b'enough to make the bodies still unidentifiable-- the authorities found' b'a gun that was recognizably fully-automatic and state of the art.' b"isn't that conveeeenient?" b'' b'convenient? it seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to' b'alt.conspiracy.' b'' b"assuming the most favorable interpretation of your degree'" b'measurement (that the temperature is in centigrade, rather than the' b'more common -in the us- fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at' b'least misconceptions:' b'' b'1. you seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around c.' b'actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are' b'iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of c. even if the gun' b'were found in area which achieved the c temperature, the steel' b'parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be' b'trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.' b'' b"2. a fire is not an isothermal process. there are 'hot' spots and" b"'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term. so the" b'weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to' b'imply. and, even if it was, so what? it would not have melted' b'anyway.' b'' b'darin' b'________________________________' b'| b'| i will be president for food b'|______________________________|'
