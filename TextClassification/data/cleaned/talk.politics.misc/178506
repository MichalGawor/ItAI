b'' b'' b'' b'candidate clinton promised to tax the rich, and most folks thought that' b'was a pretty nifty idea. then president clinton said he wanted families' b'who make more than to bear of the new tax burden, and many' b'were quick to complain that their six-figure income does not make them one' b"of the well-to-do. it's particularly ironic (to me) that it's in those" b'traditionally liberal enclaves of the bay area and academia where the' b'wealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of "just' b'regular working-class folk".' b'' b"nobody will ever admit to being rich; everybody's middle class. so who" b"are the rich? well, i'll throw out some stats from the census and" b'let you be the judge...' b'' b'} b'} that would be about to thousand us, and that is what tenured' b'} professors can expect to make. for a phd with say years experience,' b'} is a lot less than what he could be making in industry.' b'}' b"} oh? as a 12-year veteran of silicon valley, i've seen precious few" b'} employment ads that call for phds. and $65k is hardly chump change;' b"} it's well above the median *household* income for the state." b'' b'bay area average household income is in the mid-$40,000 range. national' b'average is the bay area has nearly twice the national average' b'of six-figure income households vs the cost-of-living here' b"may be high, but i don't think it's twice the national average..." b'' b'} in los angeles, modest home prices can be b'' b'a 1,500-square-foot tract house in a bay area working-class neighborhood' b'goes for about i doubt that the los angeles market is all that' b'different. it would appear that this definition of "modest" is perhaps a' b'bit immoderate...' b'' b"} so what? they're no cheaper for those who are gainfully employed." b'}' b'} in california, is not upper-middle-class.' b'}' b"} it depends upon your definition; it's clearly above average." b'' b'it is more than what two-thirds of california households make. seems' b'to me that belonging to the upper one-third is not an unreasonable' b'definition of "upper-middle-class". note that if that professor\'s' b'spouse earns they become one of clinton\'s "rich" families.' b'' b"here's a breakdown of national, california, and bay area household incomes:" b'' b'<$30k $30-50k $50-100k $100k+' b'------------------------------------' b'us the census bureau did some weird' b'ca rounding here...more like b'ba b'' b'and to add a little prespective:' b'' b'a minimum wage earner working hours/week makes $8,840/year. the poverty' b'line for a family of four is if they make up to twice that, the' b'government considers them to be "working poor". say we decide to call this' b'the "lower-middle-class". then how \'bout:' b'' b'$30-50k annual income is "middle-class". $50-100k is "upper-middle-class".' b'$100k+ is "rich". $1,000k+ is "filthy-rich". and is "bill gates".' b'' b'make sense? b'' b'-timr' b'' b'--' b"there's nothing surer," b'the rich get rich and the poor get poorer,' b'in the meantime, in between time,' b"ain't we got fun." b'--raymond egan'
