b'' b'writes:' b' in the new book about the mets it talks about how they like to rape little' b' girls before games. sick jerks!!!' b' -max' b'' b'' b'is this the book by bob klapisch (spelling?), "the' b'worst team money can buy"? if it is, i wouldn\'t give the book,' b'or anything in it any value whatsoever. klapisch wrote the' b'book to make money (obviously) and sensational literature is' b'going to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for the' b"papers. i'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proof" b'that a met player had raped a little girl before a game (let' b'alone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, not' b'shea.' b'for those people who do not know what the press is like' b'in new york, it is probably more cut-throat than in just about' b'any other part of the u.s. keith hernandez said it very well on' b'espn a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention a' b'clubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win a' b"game. i do not read klapisch's news columns regularly, but i" b'do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator' b'that enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumb' b"up a news story, even if there isn't one there. now as far as" b'the confrontation with bobby bonilla a few days ago, i almost' b'totally blame bonilla. no matter what a member of the press' b'does, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might' b'be, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a' b'journalist.' b'personally, i always thought that a beat writer that' b'always follows a club around should report the news, but not be' b"looking to degrade a team. i don't know whether to blame" b'klapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in new' b'york.'
