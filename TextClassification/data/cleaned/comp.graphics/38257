b'' b'sorry i missed you raymond, i was just out in dahlgren last month...' b'' b"i'm the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics, so perhaps i" b'can help a little.' b'' b'| hello, the real reality. our agency started to express interest in' b'| virtual reality(vr). so far, we do not know much about vr. all we' b'| know about are the hollywood movies "the terminater and "lawnmover' b'| man". we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and' b'| computer graphics world magazine.' b'' b'' b'unfortunately, while sgi systems were used to create the special effects' b'for both terminator and lawnmower man, those are film-quality computer' b'graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time. each' b'frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on' b'high-end parallel processing computer systems. thus, that level of graphics' b'would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time frames' b'per second).' b'' b'' b'|' b'| we certainly want to know more about vr. who are the leading' b'| companies,' b'| agencies, universities? what machines support vr (i.e. sgi, sun4,' b'| hp-9000, bim-6000, etc.)?' b'' b'' b'it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.' b'true immersive visualization (vr), requires the rendering of complex visual' b'databases at anywhere from to newly rendered frames per second. this' b'is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot' b'training. if the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of' b'the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion' b'of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous. thus the graphics system' b'must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex' b'data representations.' b'' b'additionally, the frame rate must be constant. if the system renders b'frames per second at one point, then frames per second the next (perhaps' b'due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was' b'visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the' b'graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. to maintain a constant' b'frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time. unix in general' b'does not support real-time operation, but silicon graphics has modified the' b'unix kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time' b'operation, bypassing the usual unix process priority-management schemes.' b'uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real-time' b'operation (not sun sparc10, not hp series systems, not ibm rs-6000, not' b"even sgi's uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson). only our" b'multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real-time operation due' b'to their symmetric multi-processing (smp) shared-memory architecture.' b'' b'from a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments' b'requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time' b'multi-sample anti-aliasing. of all of the general purpose graphics systems' b'on the market today, only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine2' b'systems fully support these capabilities. the anti-aliasing is particularly' b'important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an' b'unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.' b'' b'' b'| what kind of graphics languages are used with vr' b'| (gl, opengl, phigs, pex, gks, etc.)?' b'' b'you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop' b'vr applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. there are' b'off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,' b'being targeted directly at the vr application developer. some of the most' b'popular are (in no particular order):' b'' b'- division inc.\t\t (redwood city, ca) dvs' b'- sens8 inc.\t\t (sausalito, ca) worldtoolkit' b'- naval postgraduate school (monterey, ca) npsnet (free!)' b'- gemini technology corp (irvine, ca) gvs simation series' b'- paradigm simulation inc.
