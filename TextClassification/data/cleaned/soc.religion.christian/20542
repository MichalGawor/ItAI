b'' b'04 apr david cruz-uribe writes to all:' b'' b'dc also, what is orthodox practice regarding communion? i read' b'dc a throw-away remark someplace that the orthodox receive less' b'dc frequently than catholics do, but was is their current practice?' b'dc have their been any variations historically?' b'' b'i think orthodox practice varies from place to place, from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. in some parishes here in south africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under' b"7). in our parish it is expected that one will have been to vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting. as we have to travel 70km to the church, we don'" b't receive communion every sunday, but about every third sunday.' b'' b'steve' b'' b'--- golded
