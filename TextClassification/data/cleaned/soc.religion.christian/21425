b'' b"woo! so far, we've had the following interpretations of the figure of" b"the `whore of babylon' in rev b'' b'a) the united states of america' b'b) mho db) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who' b'corrupt and oppress human society' b'c) historical jerusalem' b'd) historical rome' b'' b'dare i suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? how' b"about the prophecy reveals god's judgement on the corrupt idolatrous" b"state oppressing his chosen people (d) that god's judgement extends" b"_especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that city's" b"special call, it still rejected god's grace at the decisive time (rev" b"11:8? also isn't rev19:24 equally suggestive of rome as jerusalem?) b'that the usofa is guilty of many of the crimes of rome/babylon (a) and' b"is equally subject to god's judgement that the good book(tm) actually" b'encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual' b"powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've" b'created. (b)' b'' b'clever, huh? flame here!) no need to argue at all!' b'' b"i think mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a" b'deliberate contrast between rev and rev the mortal' b'jerusalem chosen by god but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation' b"and the new jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by god's" b"grace. eg details like rev who sits on many waters' cf rev b'the single stream in the new jersualem `the river of life flowing from' b"the throne of god and of the lamb.'" b'' b"rex didn't understand your post what's the relevance of babylonian" b'mystery religions to all this? please elaborate your ideas about ot b"the book of rev? why do you freak at the idea of a primarily `spiritual'" b"interpretation of rev? i'd mail, but i can't get thru:" b"something you're not telling us?"
