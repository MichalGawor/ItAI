b'' b'' b" i'm wondering if i can tote my american touch tone phone around with me" b" to sweden and germany. it's dc powered, and i can buy a special adapter" b' for that in europe. the question is if the general electronics work' b" the same. i can buy a different wall plug and refit it (i'm sure i'd" b' have to), but would that do the trick?' b'' b'two things to watch for:' b'in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some' b'of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the' b'phone can be set to pulse dialing.' b"in sweden, the is the first digit and all other digits" b'are pushed "down" by one position; this makes dialing (and' b'in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.' b'otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign' b'phone to either the german or swedish phone system.' b'otoh neither you nor i would ever try that, as it is of course' b'illegal.' b'--' b'wolfgang diestelkamp' b''
