b'' b' when you and the rest of the homosexual community' b' pass laws to impose your moral codes on me, by requiring me to' b' hire, rent to, or otherwise associate with a homosexual against' b' my will, yes, you are in my face. until homosexuals stop trying' b' to impose their morals on me, i will be in your face about this.' b'' b" ahh, what's good for the goose is not necessarily what's good for" b" the gander. you don't want homosexuals to impose their moral codes" b' (such diabolical ideas as equal rights) on you, yet you are willing' b' to impose your moral codes on them. do i detect a double standard?' b'' b'what *exactly* does the american constitution say about "the right' b'to association" b'homosexuals, whether clayton likes it or not, are as much members' b'of society as he is. as such they have the right to participate and' b'have an equal opportunity to pursue their goals.' b'no-one is saying that clayton should be forced to associate with' b'queerfolk in his private life (one suspects the gays in question would' b'object also but by proclaiming the general right not to associate' b'with them in the *public* sphere (which includes housing, hiring, etc),' b"he's giving his right to non-association priority over their rights to" b'equal access to opportunity.' b'historically, people can associate publically with disliked groups' b'with very little ill-effect, however cutting a group off from normal' b'commerce has a severe impact on their lives.' b'clayton, why exactly should your "right" to non-association in the' b"public sphere take priority over homosexual's rights to equal opportunity b'' b'--' b'"usenet is like a herd of performing elephants with diarrhea massive,' b'difficult to redirect, awe-inspiring, entertaining, and a source of mind-' b'boggling amounts of excrement when you least expect it."--gene spafford,1992'
