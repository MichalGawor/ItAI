b'' b'i would like to find a windows 3.x driver for a video board that is' b'based on the chips technologies chipset. the actual board is a' b'scorpion framegrabber made by univision. it is based on the c&t' b'chipset, but only barely supports the graphics mode. i am hoping that' b'any c&t driver could be used in the 640x480x256 mode.' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'' b'--' b'stephen corbesero systems manager and adjucnt lecturer' b'bethlehem, pa voice: fax:
