b'' b'one other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-uv' b'light being cheaper to get at than actual uv light. does anyone' b'know what he was referring to?' b'' b"i don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other" b'postings "near uv light" /is/ "actual uv light." the "near" means that' b'it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),' b'not that it is "nearly uv." (i\'m sure you can figure out now just what' b'"far uv" is.)' b'' b'regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the' b'near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the' b'visible light and thus create a weak uv source. stronger sources are' b'going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as' b'fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor). be careful, though; strong uv' b'sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes. the' b'shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.' b'' b"it wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes" b'in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively' b'cheap way to create a portable source. it would be bright enough to' b'be useful, but not dangerously so.' b'' b'-ed hall'
