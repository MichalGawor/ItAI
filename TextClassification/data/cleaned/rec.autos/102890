b'' b'' b'this just a warning to everybody on the net. watch out for' b'folks standing next to the road or on overpasses. they can' b'cause serious harm to you and your car.' b'' b'(just a cliff-notes version of my story follows)' b'' b'10pm last night, i was travelling on the interstate here in' b'knoxville, i was taking an offramp exit to another interstate' b'and my wife suddenly screamed and something large hit the side' b'of my truck. we slowed down, but after looking back to see the' b'vandals standing there, we drove on to the police station.' b'' b'she did get a good look at the guy and saw him "cock his arm" with' b'something the size of a cinderblock, but i never saw him. we are' b'very lucky the truck sits up high on the road; if it would have hit' b'her window, it would have killed her.' b'' b'the police are looking for the guy, but in all likelyhood he is gone.' b'' b'i am a very good driver (knock on wood), but it was night-time and' b'i never saw the guy. the police said they thought the motive was to' b'hit the car, have us stop to check out the damage, and then jump us,' b'and take the truck.' b'' b"please be aware of folks. and for your own good, please don't stop!!!!" b'' b'peace.' b'' b'' b'--' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'{}' b'' b"as long as we're on the subject... several years ago myself and two others" b'were riding in the front of a toyota pickup heading south on interstate b'north of seattle, wa. someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our' b"windshield. not by accident i'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the" b'overpass quickly to see who did it. we figured it was kids, reported it and' b'left.' b'a couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. he was' b'in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. turned out there was' b'a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. they caught the year old' b'that did it. they put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do?' b"i don't think i'll over forget this story." b'neil williams, boeing computer services, bellevue wa.' b'.' b''
