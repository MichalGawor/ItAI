b'' b"i for one am happy about the ranger's hiring of keenan. it's too bad that they" b'' b'' b'i agree that keenan is an excellent choice. did you see mike' b"lupica's column in sunday's news? my sentiments exactly. i" b'think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire' b"into their hearts next season. either that or he's going to" b'be kicking alot of butt!' b'' b"reading through most of these hockey news i don't see many ranger fans writing." b'' b"i'm here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly" b'quiet (you know, doing the "lurking" thing). i don\'t have a' b'sense how many rangers fans there are on the list either. i' b'am a die-hard ranger fan (i guess i have to be i sat in the' b"garden throughout the penguins' led by mario's goals decimation" b'of them on but am sick at the abundance of talent that has' b'been totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this' b'season.' b'' b'' b'i have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that last' b'dreadful stretch.' b'' b"1. knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline, why didn't we see mike" b'hurlbut, who played pretty well when he was called up when leetch first went' b'down?' b'' b'' b"hurlbut was injured for quite a while. i'm not sure, but i" b'think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run, and' b"if so, like you, question why he wasn't used." b'' b'' b'2. why????!!!!! is joe kocur playing every night? he is not bob probert who is' b'tough but also can play.' b'' b'' b'i believe kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation' b'factor. granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for' b'that reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is' b"not doing any real physical intimidation (i'd like to have a nickel" b"for every time j.d. said 'they've got to take the body more')," b"you've got to at least have some illusions b'' b'3. how come paul broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of the' b'season. at least he plays with some heart and character, draws penalties and' b"plays when he's on the ice. was he in the doghouse for some reason?" b'' b"i agree and i don't know." b'' b'4. joe cirella?????!!!! enough said!' b'' b'' b"sorry, i don't agree with you here. i think joey c. did a good" b"job filling in when he was asked to. i can't imagine that it's" b"easy going from near ice time to being a full timer. i don't" b'seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too' b'much, or failing to clear the zone. he worked hard, and at' b"least didn't make any rookie mistakes. as he said himself in an" b'interview, he can only give what he has. and he did.' b'' b'' b"ranger fans may be suffering but we're some of the most loyal, unlike islander" b'fans who only show up when the team wins.' b'' b'' b'absolutely. i think attendance at the garden was better on the' b'last day of the season, than any average night for the' b'islanders.' b'' b'' b'fought series. mario is amazing!' b'' b'' b"the man is awesome. in a way, i'm enjoying the playoffs more," b"now that the rangers aren't in them. i can really appreciate" b"all the glory mario is getting without 'hating' him because he's" b"on the opposing team. he deserves it all, as far as i'm" b'concerned.' b'' b'- mary' b'' b'===============================================================' b'hamilton college' b'clinton, n.y. go rangers!!
