b'' b'' b'' b'i agree with all you write except that terrorist orgs. were not shelling' b'israel from the golan heights in but rather from lebanon. the golan' b'heights have been held by israel since and therefore the plo could' b'not have been shelling israel from there, unless there is something i am' b'not aware of.' b'' b'oops...small mistake. thanks for mentioning it. i just read on' b'the.israel.line that a village just got shelled by terrorists last week' b'and some children were killed. i guess the terrorists must have gotten by' b'the security zone. just think at how much more shelling would be' b"happening if the security zone weren't there." b'l8r...' b'' b'steve' b'--' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'| <<my opinions are not associated with anything, including my head.
