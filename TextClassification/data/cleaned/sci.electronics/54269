b'' b'i recently took apart my color sony tv to clean the volume pushbuttons and' b'when i put the beast back together, the flyback whine got much louder.' b'' b'is this easy to fix? which part is resonating? i have heard rumors of a' b'spray that will fix the noise. is this a simple thing for a tv repairman' b'to fix?' b'' b'\tthanks,' b'' b'\t\tscott' b'' b"ah-ha! i'm not alone at last! which sony do you have?? i have a" b'27"sxr (pre-xbr series, circa that damn thing used to' b'make noise like a mad-man. i had/have separate problems...one being the' b'flyback, the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke' b'came together.' b'' b'first: i found by poking around the windings on that assembly,' b'the thing would make noise. i guess that there was enough of a potential' b'in that assembly to leak, so i sprayed it with a dielectric insulation' b'spray--i think it was urethane or acyrilic. that fixed it.' b'' b"second: flyback...for the life of me, i can't isolate this one. if i" b'leave the cover off, the tv will be quiet. if i put the cover back on,' b"and let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the" b'cover on!! b'' b"a friend of mine who used to fix tv's says there might be a pin-hole" b"leak somewhere on the flyback. usually it's surrounded by a bunch of" b'black dust/dirt.' b'' b'i hope this is a start...if you find something out, let me know!' b'' b'aaron' b''
