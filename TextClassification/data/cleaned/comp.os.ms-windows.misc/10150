b'' b"here's the situation:" b'' b'at home, i have ms word for windows but no printer. at work, i' b'have windows a postscript printer, but not ms word. so, i' b'configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use' b'the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file,' b'which i then bring to work.' b'' b'my question: how do i print this postscript file through the print' b'manager at work? if, for example, i select print from the file' b'manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me' b'several pages of postscript gibberish.' b'' b'i know that i can open a dos window and do:' b'' b'copy file.ps com1:' b'' b'which does work, but seems not to multitask very well other applications' b"run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds." b'' b'there ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the print' b"manager, but if there is, i can't find any mention of it in the" b'documentation.' b'' b'anyone know how to do this?' b'' b'--' b'michael clase' b'memorial university of newfoundland'
