b'' b'' b'' b'| please clarify your standards for rules of engagement. as i' b'| understand it, israelis are at all times and under all' b'| circumstances fair targets. their opponents are legitimate' b'| targets only when mirandized, or some such?' b'|' b"| i'm sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant *a*priori*" b'| that israelis are the black hats, and that therefore killing' b'| them is automatically a good thing (go hezbollah!). the' b'| corollary is that the hezbollah are the white hats, and that' b'| whatever they do is a good thing, and the israelis only prove' b'| themselves to be bad guys by attacking them.' b'|' b'| this sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan i know, who cheers' b'| when one of the players on his team uses his stick to permanently' b"| rearrange an opponent's face, and curses the ref for penalizing" b"| his side. of course, when it's different when the roles are" b'| reversed.' b'|' b'| d. c. sessions' b'' b'well, you should have noted that i was cheering an attack on an israeli' b'patrol inside lebanese territory while i was condemning the "retaliatory"' b'shelling of lebanese villages by israeli and israeli-backed forces. my "team",' b'you see, was "playing fair" while the opposing team was rearranging the' b"faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands, so to speak." b'' b'i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on' b'in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda. there are no a priori' b'black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in' b'retaliation to pin-point attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the' b'lebanese terrorists.' b''
