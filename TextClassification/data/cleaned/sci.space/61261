b'' b'davis nicoll sez;' b' hmmm. i seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record-' b"players and radios in the 1960s wasn't better performance but lower" b'per-unit cost than vacuum-tube systems.' b'' b"i'd buy that for two reasons. the tubes for tv's and radios (if you can" b'still find them) are usually 3x or more expensive than comparable transistors.' b'' b'also, ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer, and' b"they'll tell you tube-type, since tubes have lower distortion and noise" b"than transistors. 'course, most of your electric guitar types just say" b'"tubes sound better, dude." b'' b'also, transistors have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use,' b'mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes.' b'' b'-tommy mac' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'tom mcwilliams wk as the radius of vision increases,' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------'
