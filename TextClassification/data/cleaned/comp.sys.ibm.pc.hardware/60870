b'' b'c a l l f o r v o t e' b'-------------------------' b'' b'this is the official call for a vote on the creation of newsgroups' b'for those engaged or interested in all areas relating to the' b'publishing of any sort of cdrom material. please repost this cfv to any' b'newsgroup, listserver or reflector that you think might have a' b'group interested in this subject in order to reach as broad an' b'audience as possible. every vote counts, so make sure you register' b'yours if you want these groups to be created.' b'' b'' b'proposed groups' b'---------------' b'comp.publish.cdrom.hardware' b'comp.publish.cdrom.software' b'comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia' b'' b'status' b'------' b'unmoderated.' b'' b'' b'voting period' b'-------------' b'to: est, may b'' b'how to vote' b'-----------' b'' b'-to vote, simply copy the example below and delete either the "yes"' b'or the "no" before each group to register your vote for or against' b'the creation of that group. a line containing "yes/no" as in the' b'example below, will be considered an abstention with respect to' b'that particular group. note that each group will have its own' b'separate vote count and that you may split your vote for the groups' b'or abstain as you will. please provide your name and e-mail address' b'as shown in the example below.' b'' b'email your vote following this' b'example.....' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'i vote "yes/no" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.software"' b'i vote "yes/no" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.hardware"' b'i vote "yes/no" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia"' b'' b'[last name], [first name] [(e-mail address)]' b'.' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'voting rules' b'------------' b'-only one vote per user (two different people cannot vote under the' b'same user name).' b'-any votes which are received before or after the voting period' b'will be discarded.' b'-anyone who wants to change their previous vote may do so by voting' b'again. they must indicate that they have previously voted and are' b'changing their mind in a footnote. a changed vote will discard your' b'previous vote.' b'-email messages sent to the above addresses must constitute unambiguous' b'and unconditional votes for/against newsgroup creation as proposed.' b'conditional votes will not be accepted.' b'-only votes emailed to the above addresses will be counted; mailed' b'replies to this posting will be discarded.' b'-in the event that more than one vote is placed by an individual, only' b'the first vote will be counted unless it was changed as above.' b'-no information will be supplied as to how people are voting until the' b'final acknowledgment is made at the end, at which time the full vote' b'will be made public.' b'' b'ambiguous votes' b'---------------' b'ambiguous votes those who do not follow the specified format, or' b"do not make clear the voter's intent, will, where possible, be" b'returned to their senders for clarification. ambiguous votes which' b'cannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is' b'provided will be identified in the final vote tally.' b'' b'every vote counts........feel free to flood my mail!!!' b'' b'' b'rationale' b'---------' b'the rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or' b'involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for' b'the discussion relating to their needs. at the moment the main fora' b'for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither' b'of which have publishing as their focus. some lists serve the' b'general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and' b'network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted' b'to publishing (cdpub has just been setup). in any case a list is not,' b'and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.' b'' b'the reason for the division into three groups is a natural' b'partition of interest between the hardware and software topics,' b'and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext' b'and multimedia publishing. topics such as cdrom xa, cdi, cd-r,' b'photo cd and other related formats would be included as well.' b'topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly' b'hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and' b'other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in' b'the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other' b'nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom' b'publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the internet.' b'' b'the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as' b'index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom' b'simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging' b'software, data capture software, data clean up, compression,' b'encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.' b'' b'the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that' b'aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process audio and' b'video.' b'' b'the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that' b'relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,' b'such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as' b'information that publishers need to know about the hardware that' b'the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will' b'eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.' b'' b'notes' b'-----' b'these groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or' b'questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or' b'questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.' b'requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general' b'topics should be directed to other fora. questions about cdroms' b'mounted on lans should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.' b'' b'charter' b'-------' b'' b'proposed charter comp.publish.cdrom.software' b'' b'the usenet newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for' b'discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:' b'' b'index and retrieval software' b'' b'authoring software' b'' b'scanning and imaging software' b'' b'ocr and ocr cleanup' b'' b'hypertext' b'' b'sgml' b'' b'premastering and simulation (cdrom) software' b'' b'copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms' b'' b'other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing' b'' b'proposed charter comp.publish.cdrom.hardware' b'' b'the usenet newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for' b'discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:' b'' b'cd-r equipment' b'' b'data capture hardware' b'' b'scanners' b'' b'video and audio capture hardware' b'' b'networking hardware' b'' b'midi hardware' b'' b'photo cd hardware' b'' b'publishing systems' b'' b'cdi and dvi hardware' b'' b'compression and encryption hardware' b'' b'keyboarding' b'' b'other hardware publishing topics' b'' b'proposed charter comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia' b'' b'the usenet newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for' b'discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:' b'' b'multimedia authoring software' b'' b'imaging software' b'' b'audio and midi software' b'' b'color control software' b'' b'video editing software' b'' b'audio
