b'' b'photo radar and mailed tickets make no sense at all. speeding is a moving' b'violation, committed by the operator, not the owner. the owner may be a' b'rental agency, a dealer, a private party, or a government agency. as long' b'as the owner has no reason to expect the operator will be driving illegally' b'or unsafely, the owner cannot be held responsible for what the operator does.' b"the car may even have been driven without the owner's knowledge or consent." b"i can't believe a mailed ticket, where the driver is not identified, would" b'stand up in court. this is obviously a lazy, cynical, boneheaded, fascist' b'way to extort revenue, and has nothing to do with public safety.' b'' b'- bk' b'' b'what do photo radar units look like? also, what major u.s. cities use it?' b'' b'jon dunn<' b'' b'' b''
