b'' b'' b'i heard on the radio today about a christian student conference where' b'christians were called to "repent" of america\'s "national" sins, such' b'as sexual promiscuity.' b'' b"how can i repent of _someone else's_ sin? i can't." b'' b'and when i claim to "repent" of someone else\'s sin, am i not in fact' b'_judging_ him? jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us' b'not to judge people. "judge not that ye be not judged."' b'' b"strictly speaking, you're right we can't repent _for_ somebody else," b"for what they've done. i guess i don't think it's out of line to talk" b'about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation' b'in "the sins of society" or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of' b"sinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we're also just plain" b'begging for mercy, hoping god will withhold his hand of judgement on' b'our whole country for the sake of a few, much as abraham sought to do' b'for the sake of lot. (hmmm, the results there were pretty cautionary...)' b'' b"a few times lately when i've observed some either out-and-out sinful" b"activity, or just some self-destructive activity, i've gotten a strong" b"impression that many folks really don't know any better. christ's pity" b'on the crowds as being "like sheep without a shepherd" rings true to me.' b"if these folks don't have a clue, do i bear _any_ responsibility for my" b'not having communicated a better way? worse still; have i expressed' b'judgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any' b'positive relationship whereby i might pass along anything positive?' b"i _know_ i've got something to repent about on that score." b'' b"anyway, it's a real interesting question." b'--' b'paul marxhausen b'.. university of nebraska lincoln b'. grace b'. happens
