b'' b'i ordered an external floppy drive from them years ago. when i placed' b'the order, they said it was in stock and would ship the next day. a week' b'passed and no drive. i called them up and they said they were out of stock' b'and my drive should ship in weeks or so. since i needed the drive right' b'away (both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead) i cancelled my' b"order and haven't dealt with them since." b'' b'chris kidwell' b'' b'' b'i too had a very unpleasant experience with "hardware that\'s shi*". it' b'featured repeated lies about when things had shipped, a salesperson who' b'was totally ignorant about what he was selling, a charge for duties i' b'had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor (their' b'house brand 2-page monochrome) that was the most unadulterated piece of' b'junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of' b'electronics.' b'' b'i shipped it back and they refunded my money, but it still cost me' b'something over for long distance charges, non-refundable taxes' b'and duties and lost time.' b'' b"don't deal with them." b''
