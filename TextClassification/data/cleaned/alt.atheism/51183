b'' b'| |er, jon, what ken said was:' b'| b'| there have previously been people like you in your country. unfortunately,' b'| b'| most jews did not survive.' b'| b'| |that sure sounds to me like ken is accusing the guy of being a nazi.' b'| b'' b'[my previous posting deleted]' b'' b'|' b'| yes, yes. this is a perfectly fine rant, and i agree with it completely.' b'| but what does it have to do with anything? the issue at hand here' b'| is whether or not ken accused the fellow from germany of being a' b'| nazi. i grant that he did not explicity make this accusation, but' b'| he came pretty damn close. he is certainly accusing the guy of' b'| sympathizing with those who would like to exterminate the jews, and' b"| that's good enough for me." b'' b'the poster casually trashed two thousand years of jewish history, and' b'ken replied that there had previously been people like him in germany.' b'' b"that's right. there have been. there have also been people who" b'were formally nazis. but the nazi party would have gone nowhere' b'without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the' b'street who behaved as though casual anti-semitism was perfectly' b'acceptable.' b'' b"now what exactly don't you understand about what i wrote, and why" b"don't you see what it has to do with the matter at hand?" b'' b'jon.'
