b'' b'i eagerly await comment.' b'' b'the ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the' b'driveway when she sees me coming. probably only hits 25mph, or so. (i made' b'the mistake of waving to a neighbor. she has some sort of grudge, now.)' b'' b'i was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came' b'flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with' b'my front wheel. the dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard' b'me and still had a lead when it hit the road. the dog was approaching from' b'my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of' b'the road before i went by. rover was looking back at me to calculate the' b"final trajectory. too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph" b'from the other direction.' b'' b"i got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off" b'the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front' b'tire. it managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral' b"imminent doom?) i guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have" b'swerved into my lane. the squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back' b"home, but i haven't seen it since." b'' b'sniff.' b'' b'sometimes fate sees you and smiles.' b'' b'-rick'
