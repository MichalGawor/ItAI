b'' b'i have a (very old) mac 512k and a mac plus, both of which' b'have the same problem.' b'' b'their screens blank out, sometimes after a minor physical jolt' b'(such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive), sometimes' b'all by themselves (computer left to itself just goes blank).' b'' b'i have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the' b'video board, because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires' b'made the screen come back on. this worked for a while, but the' b'blanking out has returned.' b'' b'can i do anything? do i need a new power supply? a new crt?' b'a new computer?' b'' b'thanks for any advice...' b'' b'--------------------------' b'ethan bodin' b'tufts university' b'--------------------------'
