b'' b'our group recently bought a mitsubishi p78u video printer and i could use some' b'help with it. we bought this thing because it has a parallel data input in' b'addition to the usual video signal inputs and claimed to print gray' b'level images. however, the manual that came with it only describes how to' b'format the parallel data to print and bit/pixel images. after some initial' b'problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a' b'parallel port of an hewlett-packard workstation and i can print and b'bit/pixel images just fine. i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the' b'256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video' b'signal inputs. this was not mentioned in the sales literature. however they' b'did say the p78u can do bit/pixel level) images in parallel mode, but' b"they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they" b'would call japan, etc.' b'' b'frankly, i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do bit/pixel images' b"from the video source, it can't store bits/pixel in the memory. it's not" b'like memory is that expensive any more. if anybody has any information on' b'getting bit/pixel (or even bit/pixel) images out of this thing, i would' b'greatly appreciate your sending it to me.' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'allan weber' b'signal image processing institute' b'university of southern california'
