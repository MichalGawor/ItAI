b'' b'' b' whenever a person is put on the 15-day, 30-day or 60-day,' b' the person is on the list longer than the specificed time' b'' b" i've seen a person on the 15-day for maybe months last year, i don't" b' remember what...' b'' b' i just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications.' b'' b"i believe we are down to two: the 15-day and the 60-day. (i don't remember" b"a 30-day, but rather a 21-day. anyways, it's gone now.) the period length" b'is a minimum, not a maximum. you can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long' b"as you want, if he's still certified as injured. the player must be" b"periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you" b'cannot park a player on the dl who maybe is out of options and you do not' b'wish to expose to waivers). if you get someone qualified for the 60-day' b'that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations. there is no longer, i' b'believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the dl. when' b'there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between' b'the lists.' b'--king "sparky" banaian\t\t\t\t|"no taxes: no new taxes,' b'dept. of economics, pitzer college\t\t|enough." rep. alan keyes' b'latest gdp forecast: 2.4%\t\t| (please run, alan!)'
