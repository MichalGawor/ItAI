b'' b'getting back to the original question in this thread:' b'' b'i experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those' b'described. in my case, it turned out that i was developing type i' b'diabetes. although i never sought direct confirmation of this from my' b'doctor, i think that the breathing problem was associated with the' b'presence of ketones due to the diabetes.' b'' b'i think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting' b"their food intake drastically. i don't know if this relevant in this" b'case, but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating' b'properly.' b'--' b'steve kirchoefer b'naval research laboratory microwave technology branch' b'washington, dc electronics sci. and tech. division'
