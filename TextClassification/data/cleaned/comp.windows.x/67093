b'' b'i have a sun that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 built on the' b'motherboard. the same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 b'daughterboard. i have been using this system with a color monitor having a' b'color "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the' b'bwtwo1, both on the same tube. i recentley picked up a x sun mono' b'monitor, and i would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the' b'bwtwo0. i do not care if i loose the "back" screen on the color tube from the' b'bwtwo1. after looking through the xsun man page i am not sure if this is' b'possible. has anybody sucessfuly done this before?' b'' b'--matthew' b''
