b'' b'' b'this group was originally a takeoff from sci.med. the reason for' b'the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive' b'drugs....such as b'' b'oh well, obviously, no one really cares.' b'---' b'' b'then let me ask you for a "workable" solution. we have a name' b'here that implies certain things to many people. rather than trying' b'to educate each and every person that comes to the group is there' b'some "name" that would imply what this group was originally' b'intended for?' b'' b'my dad was a lawyer as such i grew up with being a stickler' b'for "meaning". in my "reality", psychoactives *technically* could' b'range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more' b'standard recreational drugs. in practice i had hoped to see it' b'limited to those that were above some psychoactive level like' b'some of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*' b'recreational drugs but with conversation limited to their psychoactive' b'effects the recent query about "bong water", i thought was a bit' b'off topic so i just hit "k".' b'' b'but back to the original question what is a workable solution b'what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to' b'discuss? it sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something' b"similar i don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to" b'describe alot of those drugs. there is a big difference between a' b'drug that if taken in "certain doses, over a period of days may have' b'a psychoactive effect in some people", vs. many of the drugs in' b'pihkah which *are* psychoactive.' b'' b'' b'wm' b'--' b'' b':: if pro-choice means choice after conception, does this apply to men too?
