b'' b'' b'folks,' b'' b"it's time to start building some precise questions to send to our" b'federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our' b'local tv, radio and newprint media. ideally, these questions could be' b"asked at any investigation into the batf's and fbi's participation" b'at the waco fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake' b'up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth' b'from the batf and fbi. my list is up to that are really nagging' b'at my gut. the list will probably grow.' b'' b'1. what were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that' b'the batf obtained?' b'' b'2. it is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition' b'could not be flushed down the toilet. therefore, a "no-knock"' b'raid could be ruled out. prior to the initial assault on the' b'complex, did a single batf agent and accompanying witness (without' b'a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock' b"on the door of the branch davidian's complex and serve the warrant" b'in a manner prescribed by law?' b'' b'3. on the day of the initial assault on the complex, batf agents' b'were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.' b'in the ensueing gun battle, batf agents fired into a building' b'known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.' b"knowing children were present, why didn't the batf have an" b'alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to' b'the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening' b'fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building?' b'' b'4. the fbi spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that' b'david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over' b'$200,000 in firearms and ammunition. did david koresh and the' b'members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms' b'license, were they actively participating in the legal business' b'of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the' b'weapons they had illegally possessed? does this paper evidence' b'consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally' b'dispossessed weapons.' b'' b'5. after the original assault on the compound tragically failed,' b'a batf spokeswoman stated "we were outgunned!". yet, tv newscasts' b'of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents' b'armed with mp-5 and ar-15/m16 rifles. although unclear on the' b"video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's" b'bodies, they also may have had ak-47 and sks rifles. what type(s)' b'of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the' b'scene of the original assault on the complex?' b'' b'6. since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the' b'complex involuntarily, why did the fbi treat it as a "hostage"' b'situation?' b'' b'7. along the same lines, why did the fbi use "psychological warfare"' b'techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and' b'other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any' b'normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the' b'complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?' b'' b'8. reports indicate several of the children inside the complex' b'were accompanied by their mothers. since it is reasonable' b'to expect these mothers would have their children taken away' b'from them if they came out, why did the fbi expect the mothers' b'to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?' b'' b'9. agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch' b'davidians setting fire to the complex. branch davidian members' b'who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an' b'armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a' b'lantern which was setting on a table. video tape of the incident' b'does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the' b'fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.' b'was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle' b'penetrated?' b'' b'10. fbi spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and' b'the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide. yet,' b'bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas' b'within the building complex. this seems to be counter to any' b'known mass suicides through history. what evidence does the fbi' b'have that a mass suicide pact existed?' b'' b'11. fbi director sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on' b"the video tape was caused by the branch davidian's ammunition" b'and/or powder cache exploding. yet, the fireball seems to be' b'more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas' b'or other highly volatile fuel source explodes. was any evidence' b'found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition' b'and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball? if so,' b'and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were' b'engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the' b'amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect' b'for someone engaged in such a legal business?' b'' b'12. it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical' b'news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to' b"crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound. is" b'there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will' b'be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act?' b'' b'13. fbi director sessions states that, during the final assault on the' b'complex, "over shots were fired at the vehicles." on the video' b'tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles' b'engines. yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one' b'would expect to hear if shots were fired. also, there are no' b'indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,' b'buildings or other structures in the video. surely, these should be' b'evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.' b'finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter,' b'sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be' b'apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles. do' b'any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas' b'into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by' b'shots from high-power rifles?' b'' b'14. cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent. the united' b'states has signed international treaties which prevent the use' b'of cs gas in warfare. if the united states could not morally use' b'cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops, why is it morally' b'acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?' b'' b'15. on april fbi spokesmen state that at least bodies discovered' b'in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had' b'been murdered or had committed suicide. on april the county' b'coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet' b'wounds to the head. were any of the victims bodies found within' b'the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?' b'--' b'**************************************************************' b'* senior customer engineer b'* intergraph electronics b'* east evelyn avenue voice: b'* mountain view, ca fax: b'**************************************************************'
