b'' b'i posted on here about a problem with a datadesk 101e keyboard that' b'failed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressed' b'or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key. after absolutely' b'no help from datadesk i called macconnection tech support. they tried it out' b'on their centris and had the same problem. they immediately offered' b'to get a new keyboard, try it on their centris and ship it to me' b'overnight if it worked. i could send them my keyboard back after i' b'got the one that worked. this is from a guy in tech support named dave.' b'it turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face' b'before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command-option. i really like' b'this keyboard so i was glad to be able to keep it. on the other hand,' b"datadesks tech support sucks while macconnection's is great!" b'-terry'
