(session keys are negotiated, but knowing' b'the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the' b'security. no doubt more details will emerge.)' b'' b'so, the loss of a key, whether one is guilty or innocent, may mean a lot' b'more than merely replacing the phone.' b'' b'sort of like saying to someone, "oh, i copied your diary. but i\'ll buy' b'you a new one."' b'' b'' b'and the system, if made mandatory (as i expect), will make such' b'storing of conversations much easier, i fear. for one thing, the' b'transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone' b'listening, a kind of "caller id" and "callee id" on a grand scale.' b'also, the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the' b'privacy of the calls, as they perceive them all to be useless' b'encrypted junk. (this is a bit of a reach, i know, suggesting that the' b'clipper will make security more lax...).' b'' b'anyway, still lots of issues unresolved.' b'' b'' b'-tim may' b'' b'' b'--' b'..........................................................................' b'timothy c. may crypto anarchy: encryption, digital money,' b'408-688-5409 knowledge, reputations, information markets,' b'w.a.s.t.e.: aptos, ca black markets, collapse of governments.' b'higher power: public key: pgp and mailsafe available.' b''
