b'' b'' b'[bh] tsiel,' b'' b'[bh] i would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border,' b"[bh] starting from the early 70's. certainly the plo did shell northern" b'[bh] israel from the arqoub region, but israel did much more shelling' b'[bh] destroying several south lebanese villages. at the very least' b'[bh] we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional' b'[bh] aerial raids by israel on lebanese villages.' b"[bh] in any case steve's characterization that the invasion was only in" b'[bh] response to years of shelling from lebanon is false. israel had' b'[bh] many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government' b'[bh] in lebanon favorable to israel, and it nearly achieved this aim' b'[bh] with the election of basheer el gemayel, and his brother, amin' b'[bh] el gemayel, but the internal situation in lebanon was too hard' b'[bh] to control and predict so israel had to withdraw, and amin el gemayel' b'[bh] had to abrogate the th of may agreement.' b'' b'basil,' b'' b"i was only correcting steve's statement that geurillas were shelling israel" b'from the golan, which was absurd.' b'the fact that "israel did much more shelling" was in response to palestinian' b'shelling from lebanon. israel has no intention of keeping an inch of lebanese' b'territory. israel will continue to fight hizbullah, plo, fplp etc. as long as' b'its northern border is not quiet. if the lebanese army can control these' b'elements then i think we can see genuine peace on the israel-lebanese border.' b'i remind you that a couple thousand lebanese cross each day into israel to' b'work.' b'as for the election of bashir gemayel, it is true that he was favorable to' b'israel, is that why the syrians killed him? his brother amin was a syrian' b'puppet, if he had not been, he would have been dead by now.' b'' b'tsiel' b'--' b'----8<---------------------------------------------------------------8------' b'employer may not have same know as soon as possible, if possible.' b'opinions, if any two percent of zero is almost nothing.'
