b'' b'hello world,' b'' b"i'm attempting to write an simulator on an ibm pc for teaching" b"purposes, so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings" b'of the microcontroller as it performs operations logical ands, for' b'example, being shown on a bit-by-bit basis and so that the' b"students can see that it's not really a mystical process, but totally" b"logical, for example. every instruction should show some 'working'," b'and not just alter register/memory/port contents.' b'' b'does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code,' b"in pascal or modula-2, that would show me where i'm going wrong" b"in writing my simulator? [i'm using ayala's -the microcontroller-" b'as a reference the simulator supplied with the package is overkill' b"for simple teaching purposes, i feel, and there's no source code to help" b'you roll your own.]' b'' b'please email me if you can help, or if you know of somewhere more' b'appropriate i should be posting this i rarely scan these groups.' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'lloyd wood' b''
