b'' b"ra here's the point: there are far too many europeans in the nhl." b'r i am sick of watching a game between an american and a canadian' b"ra team (let's say, the red wings and the canucks) and seeing names" b'r like "bure" "konstantinov" and "borshevshky". is this north america' b"ra isn't it?" b'' b'i disagree. i think the nhl should feature the best hockey talent in' b'the world regardless of nationality. i have to admit that when i' b'see players like gretzky and messier traded off to the us because the' b"canadian teams can't afford them, i have been know to say (only half-" b"seriously) that we'd probably be better off if we had our own canadian" b'hockey league for canadian players! b'' b"ra i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league, and let" b'ra te bures and selannes of the world play on their own continent.' b'' b'ra' b"ra i just don't want themon mine." b'' b"again, it doesn't matter to me russian, finnish, mexican, albertan," b"new yorker, black, white, korean, martian, plutoneon, it doesn't" b'matter.' b'' b"any of them can put a leafs' jersey on if they can put the puck in!" b':-)' b'' b'stephen legge' b''
