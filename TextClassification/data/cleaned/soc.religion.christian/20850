b'' b'pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup. i would describe myself as' b"an agnostic, in so far as i'm sure there is no single, universal" b'supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be' b'judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that' b'goodness that is within the power of each of us. now, the' b'complication is that one of my best friends has become very' b'fundamentalist. that would normally be a non-issue with me, but he' b'feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which i guess it is,' b'according to his faith). this is a great strain to our friendship. i' b"would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does," b'the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended' b'because i call into question his bedrock beliefs; i am offended by' b'what i feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such' b"circular arguments as 'the bible is god's word because he tells us in" b"the bible that it is so.' so my question is, how can i convince him" b'that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve' b'what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great' b"friendship? how do i convince him that i am 'beyond saving' so he" b"won't try? thanks for any advice." b'' b'--' b'jim tomlinson "falling snow' b'boeing computer services ...uunet!bcstec!voodoo!jdt anderson/gabriel'
