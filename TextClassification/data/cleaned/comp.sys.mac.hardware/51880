b'' b'} i would like more info on this if anybody has it. our exabyte' b'} tapedrive has never been working from the quadra b'} we have been trying it since september replaced cabling,' b'} inits, i don\'t know what all. all the "industry experts" we' b'} phoned (the tapedrive dealer, our apple dealer, the software' b"} dealer) all say it's our fault, or they don't know. the last" b'} thing they said was that we needed a special quadra scsi terminator' b'} anybody know more? thanks,' b'' b'(mark h. nodine) wrote:' b'' b" i don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your" b' message, but i definitely had scsi problems between my' b' q700 and my venerable jasmine megadrive cartridge' b' drives. my solution was to get silverlining. none of' b' the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives;' b' in fact the only loop that worked was the "macintosh' b' software" loop (whatever that means).' b' b' i doubt this is a quadra-specific problem. i had to get' b' rid of my "venerable" bernoulli last year (with enough' b' cartridges purchased at each to make the whole thing' b' worth more than my whole computer the tech support guys' b' at ocean microsystems suggested that some third-party drivers' b" might fix the problem in my case the cartridges wouldn't" b' format/mount/partition for a/ux.' b'' b' all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my' b' mac plus and my powerbook it was for this reason i assumed' b' the problem had something to do with the quadra. even with the' b' quadra, they mostly worked ok. the problem occurred when i ejected' b' a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes' b' saying "this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware"' b' even though there was no cartridge in the drive.' b'' b' \t--mark' b'' b'i have been using the pli (sony) mo drive and now a sharp color' b'scanner using standard scsi cables and standard terminator on my q700.' b'no problems. if you were using a iifx, that might be another story.' b'' b'make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the' b'end. some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and' b'others are socketted. these count. if the box with internal terminations' b'cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be' b'disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets. if you have b'boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be' b'disabled...., etc. i am sure that this has been covered by the "experts".' b'' b'my experience with scsi boxes that connect to the mac indicates that they' b"must have some software package for the mac to 'talk' to them. my pli mo" b'drive and sharp scanner has one for each.' b'' b'good luck.' b'' b'art beattie' b'==============================================================' b'i only speak for myself.' b'=============================================================='
