b'' b':' b': i am considering buying a chevy or gmc 4x4 full-size pickup with' b': the extended cab. any opinions about these vehicles? have there been' b': any significant problems?' b':' b': b': so many newsgroups, so little time!' b'' b'' b'i bought a brand new chevrolet k2500 hd 4x4 extended cab last' b'may. it has had many, many problems. see my earler post that describes' b'the situation. i went to bbb arbitration, and they ruled that chevrolet' b'must buy it back from me. if you do get one, stay away from the speed' b'manual with the deep low first gear. they have put three of them in my' b'truck so far. after about miles, overdrive either starts' b'rattling or hissing loudly. there is no way to fix them. chevrolet' b'says that the noise is "a characteristic of the transmission."' b'' b'also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the' b'gear ratios in that tranny suck. on a steep hill, you get up to about' b'55 mph in second gear at rpm (yellow line). if you shift to third,' b'the rpm drop to only and you begin to loose speed. i should' b'point out that the v8 they put in the hd gvw) trucks is a' b'detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones. they' b'dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for "engine longevity"' b'reasons. so the light duty may pull better than my truck does.' b'other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan times' b'so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being' b'shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between' b'stabilizer and control arm fell off).' b'' b'any company can make a bad individual car, chevrolet included. what' b'really bothered me was the way they reacted. they made no attempt' b'to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for' b'them to attempt to fix it one more time. so i bought a brand new' b'ford f250 hd super cab with a and an automatic. i will never' b'buy another chevrolet.' b''
