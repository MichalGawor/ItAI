b'' b'#' b'# i think the original post was searching for existing implementations of' b'# f.i. gouroud-shading of triangles. this is fairly complex to do with plain' b'# x. simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie' b'# where to get the latest version).' b'# for gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension' b'# only, either mit-shm to do the shade in an image and fast update the window' b'# with it, or pex/opengl which should be able to shade themselves. the portable' b"# 'vanilla x' way would be to shade in a normal ximage and use xputimage()," b'# what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes' b'# or such stuff.' b'#' b'# to speak about povray, the x previewer that comes with the original source' b'# package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and' b'# icccm compliance. have a look on x256q, my own preview code. it is on' b'#' b'# 141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/' b'#' b'# the readme states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from' b'# povray b'#' b'' b'the version i have is using the x256q code instead of the default x windows' b'code. i have it currently running on a dec alpha running openvms axp and' b'so far have been pretty impressed. the only "side-effect" of x256q is that' b'it requires xstdcmap -best be run before it will work, annoyning but not a' b'show stopper.' b'' b'patrick l. mahan' b'' b'' b'waking a person unnecessarily should not be considered lazarus long' b'a capital crime. for a first offense, that is from the notebooks of' b'lazarus long'
