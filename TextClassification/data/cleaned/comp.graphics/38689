b'' b'i bought the diamond stealth a few months ago. it seems to be a' b'great card especially with my multimedia presentations. it runs graphics' b'and animation as well as some near full motion video very well. the only' b'thing i can tell that it lacks is speed above colors. its qualit in' b'between and million collors un unreal but you definitly' b'compromise speed. it seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes' b'with some great software, but im not so sure about the excelerator' b'part. i used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster' b'than that. one thing i do like is that it loads its own vesa driver' b'from rom at startup, (i think) because i have never had to load it for' b'links386 or any other programs that require special vesa drivers at' b'startup.' b'' b'' b'' b'gromi a16pd' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'' b'' b''
