b'' b'' b'oh, this all sounds so nice! everyone helping each other and always smiling' b'and fluffy bunnies everywhere. wake up! people are just not like that. it' b'seems evident from history that no society has succeeded when it had to rely' b"upon the goodwill and unselfishness of the people. isn't it obvious from" b'places like iran that even if there are only a few greedy people in society' b'then they are going to be attracted to positions of power? sounds like a' b'recipe for disaster.' b'' b'--' b'' b'' b"leonard, i'll give you an example of this...." b'' b'my father recently bought a business, the business price was pounds' b'and my father approached the people in the community for help, he raised' b'60,000 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and' b'muslims he knew, had cash and the rest he got a business loan, after' b'paying off the muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans' b'to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest, this' b'is an example of a muslim community helping one another, why did they help' b'because of their common identity as muslims. in turn my father has helped' b'with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay' b'and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more' b'fortunate in the community.' b'' b'the fact is leonard it does work without a fluffy bunny in sight!' b'ithat is the beauty of islam.' b'' b'mas' b'' b'' b'--' b'c i t i z e n b'_____ c a d e n c e d e s i g n s y s t e m s inc. b'_____/
