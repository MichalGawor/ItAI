b'' b'' b'today rush was criticizing clinton for not claiming responsibility for the' b'actions and decisions of janet reno and the fbi early enough to suit' b'rush.' b'' b'about months ago rush was chortling over the fact that reagan has stumped' b'"special persecutor walsh" with his croaking of "i don\'t remember" when' b'asked about ollie north.' b'' b"if rush's criticism of clinton were to be applied to reagan and north..." b'reagan would have been impeached while north was convicted (and overturned on' b'a technicality).' b'' b'gosh, rush sure wants to have it both ways... clinton must be held' b'responsible, but reagan was clever by using the "amnesia defense".' b'' b"maybe that's waht clinton should say about campaign promises and such" b'"well, there you go again rush... but to tell the truth, i wasn\'t in the' b'loop and i just don\'t remember."'
