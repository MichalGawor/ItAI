b'' b'once again, the rockies bullpen fell apart. andy ashby pitched six (somewhat' b'shaky) innings giving up just one run. then game the dreaded relief. three' b'picthers combined to give up runs (one each i believe) in the 7th inning' b'and blew the save opportunity. (final was vs expos).' b'' b'despite their problems in the pen, i think the rockies are a team that wont' b"be taken lightly. going into today's game, the had the league's leading" b'hitter and rbi man (galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (young' b'and cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
