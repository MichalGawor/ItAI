b'' b'' b'while watching the penguins/devils game last night, i saw the "slash" that' b'barrasso took on the neck. this brought to mind the goaltender who had his' b"jugular vein cut by a skate. i think he was a sabre, but i'm not positive." b'does anyone remember/know his name? what has happened to him since? what' b'about the player whose skate cut the goalie? name? info? has this ever' b'happened before in a hockey game?' b'' b"it was clint malarchuk's neck cut by uwe krupp's skate. i know it happened in" b"buffalo, but i can't tell you against whom." b'' b'krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net.' b'' b'malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind hasek, puppa and draper) after' b"suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. he's been playing in san diego" b'for former sabre coach rick dudley.' b'' b'krupp is now playing for the islanders after the lafontaine/turgeon trade.' b'' b'what do i win? b'' b'---' b'state university of new york at buffalo something fundamentally wrong' b'with the universe."'
