b'' b' i have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles. this' b'andi beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism.' b"ok, you've already disqualified yourself (who ever you are) from" b'being objective.' b'' b' you all are an insult to you race!' b'{assuming you are also semitic}' b'' b'jews are a people with a common cultural heritage, religion, and history.' b'we are not a race.' b'' b'' b'\tnow i have a comment concerning israeli terrorism' b"during the 1930's and 1940's. the hirgun, and other branch b'off militant groups, did fight the british do get them out of' b'palestine. yet i fail to see how this israeli form of' b'terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the' b'arabs. these jewish terrorist groups killed innocent british' b'soldiers' b'' b"you don't see a difference between killing british soldiers (who were" b'preventing jews who tried to escape the nazis from entering the' b'british mandate) and arab terrorist who kill civilian men, women, and' b'children?!?' b'' b'' b"i mention this not because i'm anti semitic [i'm part" b'jewish]' b'' b"that's ridiculuous on atleast two counts. first of all, even if you identify" b"yourself as completely jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're" b'a self-hating anti-semite. one can always find jews who are uncomfortable with' b'their identities (since they only want jews to be cowering victims) and are' b'willing to speak up for their enemies. secondly, the strength or weakness of' b'your arguments does not depend on your identity.' b'' b'-adam schwartz' b'(not affraid to sign my name).' b''
