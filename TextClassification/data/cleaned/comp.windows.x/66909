stub' b'routines are provided to handle the c<-fortran interface without any' b'modification of the user program. c programs are required to include the' b'header file "plplot.h"; see the documentation for more details.' b'' b'the main documentation for plplot is in the doc/ directory in the form of' b"several tex files;
