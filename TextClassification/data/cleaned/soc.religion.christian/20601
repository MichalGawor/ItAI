b'' b'the concept of god as a teacher is indeed interesting. does he grade on' b'a curve, does he cheat? that is interesting. not to mention thought' b'provoking. my own concept is that he is a father and we are his' b'children. in that he loves us, with a love that we can never understand' b'until we are with him. the bible says that he looks on the heart as the' b'final measure. from that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is' b'the final test.' b'specifically, most christians would agree that there is only one heaven' b'and one hell. from that perspective, it is heaven or hell. you either go' b'to one or the other. the "grading" on a pass/fail basis is done by god' b'the father with intervention by jesus the son. not by others. for only' b'god sees the heart. the bible says of the heart, "...who can know it." i' b'would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.' b'that is what makes a relationship with christ so secure. in an uncertain' b'and ever changing landscape he is always the same. yesterday, today and' b'tomorrow. concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part' b'of the test, my own conviction is no. were that the case i certainly' b"wouldn't be going to heaven. the bible speaks very plainly about the" b'love and care jesus had for and about children. the reality is that we' b'are all children. some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. but' b'the father, our father is always there. like most fathers he wants only' b'the best for his own. there maybe decipline, but there is more love.' b"it's sometimes looks like christianity is a test, to see who makes it" b"and who doesn't. those who do pass=heaven, and those who don't go to the" b'other place. but it is really much more than that...' b'there are few experts. most of us are just travelers looking for the' b'light and the way home. praying that we can bring others with us.'
