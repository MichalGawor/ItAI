b'' b'i am planning on upgrading my old xt compatible system with a new' b'motherboard, hard drive, and mb floppy.' b'' b'i am interested in using my old power supply w) to power the new' b'hardware, if possible.' b'' b'i have been told by the motherboard vendor that i could probably' b'use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard.' b'(apparently some xt vintage supplies had only wires the' b'12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery).' b'' b'my question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire' b'out of an wire supply or using an auxiliary power source' b'to charge the motherboard battery?' b'' b'i do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if i can' b'make use of my existing one with simple hacks.' b'' b'thank you for any information.' b'' b'-larry arbanas'
