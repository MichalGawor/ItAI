b'' b'' b'|you might visit some congregations of christians, who happen to be homosexuals,' b"|that are spirit-filled believers, not mcc'rs; before you go lumping us all" b'|together with troy perry.' b'|' b'' b'gee, i think there are some real criminals (robbers, muderers, drug' b"addicts) who appear to be fun loving caring people too. so what's" b'your point? is it ok. just because the people are nice?' b'' b"|isn't satan having a hayday pitting christian against christian over any issue" b"|he can, especially homosexuality. let's reach the homosexuals for christ." b"|let's not try to change them, just need to bring them to christ. if he" b"|doesn't want them to be gay, he can change that. if they are living a moral" b'|life, committed to someone of the same sex, and god is moving in their lives,' b'|who are we to tell them they have to change?' b'|' b'' b'i think the old saying hate the sin and not the sinner" is' b'appropriate here. many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably' b"don't hate the people. i don't. i don't hate my kids when they do" b"wrong either. but i tell them what is right, and if they lie or don't" b"admit they are wrong, or just don't make an effort to improve or" b'repent, they get punished. i think this is quite appropriate. you' b'may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here.' b'maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through' b'feel goodism. maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more' b'than god. kind of like the adam and eve story. read it and compare' b"it to today's mentality. you may be suprised."
