b'' b':chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver' b':biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months' b':after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have' b':persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. the degree of' b':elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times' b':normal. other blood chemistries are usually normal.' b':as a rule, patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease.' b':chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at' b":least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of" b':a biopsy. the patient with cph only needs to be reassured. the patient with' b':cah needs to be treated.' b'' b'i just went back to the chapter in cecil on chronic hepatitis. it seems' b'that indeed most cases of cph are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas' b'there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for cah (viral,' b'drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.). physicians seem to have a variety of' b'"thresholds" for electing to biopsy someone\'s liver. personally, i think' b'that if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and' b'normal albumin and pt, one can simply follow them closely and not add the' b'potential risks of a biopsy. others may well biopsy such a patient, thus' b'providing these samples for study. it would be interesting to see if' b"anyone's done any decision analysis on this." b'' b'--' b'=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=' b'= kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh b'= general internal medicine "...dammit, not a programmer!" b'=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-='
