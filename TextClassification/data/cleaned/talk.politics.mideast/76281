b'' b'' b'' b'| i think the israeli press might be a tad bit biased in' b'| reporting the events. i doubt the propaganda machine of goering' b'| reported accurately on what was happening in germany. it is' b'| interesting that you are basing the truth on israeli propaganda.' b'|' b'| since one is also unlikely to get "the truth" from either arab or' b'| palestinian news outlets, where do we go to "understand", to learn?' b'| is one form of propoganda more reliable than another? the only way' b'| to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer\'s "political' b'| agenda", whether it is "on" or "against" our *side*.' b'|' b'| tim' b'' b'to andi,' b'' b'i have to disagree with you about the value of israeli news sources. if you' b'want to know about events in palestine it makes more sense to get the news' b'directly from the source. every news source is inherently biased to some' b'extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. however,' b'the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the "truth" and to discern' b'the bias.' b'' b'go read or listen to some israeli media. you will learn more news and more' b'opinion about israel and palestine by doing so. then you can form your own' b"opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't" b'change.' b'' b'jake can call me doctor mohandes brad "ali" hernlem (as of last wednesday)'
