b'' b'' b'in previous postings by hellman, bellovin, etal it was' b'reported the big brother (clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in' b'64 bit blocks as is done with des. the users key k which can be' b'derived from rsa, diffy-hellman, etc. is used to encrypt' b'plaintext m and is then used to form a "three part message".' b'this three part message consists of e[m; k], k encrypted' b'with some other key, and the chip serial number. this three part' b'message is then encrypted by still another key.' b'my question is: what is a message?' b'for example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized' b'voice application. the speech waveform is sampled and digitized' b'and then some number of samples are grouped into a bit block.' b'this block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure' b'communications link.' b'where is the three part message? is something appended to' b'each bit block? is a header sent at the beginning of the' b'session?' b'if the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how' b'do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does' b'just that? can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?' b'is a facility clearance required to manufacture?' b'any ideas?'
