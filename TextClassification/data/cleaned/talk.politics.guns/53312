b'' b' no, you haven\'t read it very closely it says you may answer "no" if your' b" civil rights have been restored; that can be done either by the feds' or a" b' a state. i think the feds stopped doing this for those convicted of violent' b' felonies. at least a dozen states still restore a felons civil rights, some' b' immediately upon release, some after a waiting period. i will post a list' b' of the states later.' b'' b'' b" a quick question, then larry, if a person's civil rights have been restored," b' then are they still considered a felon?' b'' b"good question; i don't know what the law considers them." b'' b' imo, if rights have been restored, then it makes sense to me that the' b' record of the felony, and everything else has been purged, and the' b' person in question is no longer a felon.' b'' b'i believe this is what happens in some states.' b'--'
