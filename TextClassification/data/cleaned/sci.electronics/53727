b'' b'-| i just installed a motorola xc68882rc50 fpu in an amiga a2630 board mhz' b'-| with capability to clock the fpu separately). previously' b'-| a mc68882rc25 was installed and everything was working perfectly. now the' b'-| systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for' b'-| the presence/type of fpu. when i reinstall an mc68882rc25 the system works' b'-| fine, but with the xc68882 even at mhz it does not work. the designer' b'-| of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe ohm)' b"-| might help, but that didn't change anything. does anybody have some" b'-| suggestions what i could do? does this look like a cpu-fpu communications' b'-| problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?' b'-| moreover, the place i bought it from is sending me an xc68882rc33. i thought' b'-| that the 68882rc33 were labeled mc not xc (for not finalized mask design).' b'-| are there any mc68882rc33?' b'-|' b'-| thanks' b'-| \tchristian' b'-|' b'' b'' b'have you changed the crystal that clocks for the fpu. if you' b"haven't then it won't work." b'' b'' b'conrad'
