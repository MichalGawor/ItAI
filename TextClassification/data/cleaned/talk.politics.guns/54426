b'' b'now that big brother has rubbed out one minority religion in waco, who is' b'next? the mormons or jews?' b'' b'the koreshians rubbed themselves out. neither mormons nor jews have a' b"propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene, so i'm not particularly" b'concerned. (or shall we blame jim jones on the government also?)' b'...' b'' b'let\'s see if i have this straight. a law is created that says "you can not' b'have a automatic weapon" and therefore it\'s ok for the government to use' b"any level of force to enforce that law. doesn't matter if the entire" b'population of the planet is destroyed as long as that law is obeyed.' b'' b'do i read you correctly?'
