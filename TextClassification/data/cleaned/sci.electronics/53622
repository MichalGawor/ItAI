b'' b'' b'how thick do i need to make a pcb trace for amps of current? and' b'does anybody have any other thoughts on the process (what kind of pcb' b'to use, materials, thickness of copper, any advice graciously accepted)?' b'' b"in four replies, i've seen no hard numbers, so here goes: for traces" b'on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in oz copper, at amps,' b"the following temperature rises versus width. this is from sams'" b'"reference data for engineers," seventh edition, pg which claims' b'in turn to be from mil-std-275c...' b'' b'width temp rise' b'inches degrees c' b'------ b'.125\t100' b'.15\t b'.17\t b'.20\t b'.24\t b'.33\t b'' b'at amps, the rise for the width is only about degrees.' b'power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes' b'up as temperature goes up... certainly (~5mm) traces should be' b'ample for what you want to do. and ounce copper almost cuts the' b'required width in half. (i\'d do oz at about width myself,' b'i think...given that the _rated_ current is amps and the is' b'a transient or fault condition.)' b'' b"(there's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough?" b'but you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or' b'just the resistivity of copper. keep traces short and use separate' b'sensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)'
