b'' b'here is a press release from the natural resources defense council.' b'' b'new data show about major u.s. water supplies vulnerable to' b'milwaukee-type disease outbreak' b'to: national desk, environment writer' b'contact: erik olson or sarah silver, both' b'of the natural resources defense council' b'' b'washington, april internal epa data released' b'today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about' b'100 large water systems serving cities from boston to san' b'francisco do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms' b'leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease' b'outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee.' b'the epa list is attached.' b'"these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water' b'supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate' b'pollution controls or filtration," said erik olson, a senior' b'attorney with nrdc. "water contamination isn\'t just a problem in' b'bangladesh, it\'s also a problem in bozeman and boston."' b'"as of june about large surface water systems on' b"epa's list probably will be breaking the law. the safe" b'drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either' b'filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use' b'from pollution," olson continued. some systems are moving' b'towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are' b"expected to miss the law's deadline." b'olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already' b'a reality in other cities. a survey of u.s. surface' b'water systems by water utility scientists found that percent' b'of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism' b'cryptosporidium, and percent contained a similar parasite' b'called giardia.' b'adding to the level of concern, a general accounting office' b'study released today by house health and environment subcommittee' b'chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the' b"nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary" b'surveys of water systems.' b'"this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions' b'of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be' b'assured that their water is safe to drink. we must immediately' b'put into place programs to protect water sources from' b'contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment' b'must be installed to protect the public," olson noted. "the time' b"has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop" b'dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from' b'contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs' b'needed to assure their water is safe to drink."' b'nrdc is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.' b'' b'systems epa indicates require filtration and do not adequately' b'protect watersheds' b'' b'connecticut' b'' b'bridgeport bridgeport hydraulic co.' b'' b'massachusetts' b'boston h2o resource author (mwra)' b'medford mwra-medford water dept' b'melrose mwra-melrose water dept' b'hilton mwra-hilton water dept' b'needham mwra-needham water division' b'newtoncenter mwra-newton water dept.' b'marblehead mwra-marblehead water dept' b'quincy mwra-quincy water dept' b'norwood mwra-norwood water dept' b'framingham mwra-framingham water div' b'cambridge mwra-cambridge water dept' b'canton mwra-canton water div-dpw' b'chelsea mwra-chelsea water dept' b'everett mwra-everett water dept' b'lexington mwra-201 bedford (puo wrks)' b'lynn mwra-lynn water sewer co' b'malden mwra-malden water division' b'revere mwra-revere water dept' b'woburn mwra-woburn water dept' b'swampscott mwra-swampscott water dept' b'saugus mwra-saugus water dept' b'somerville mwra-somerville water dept' b'stoneman mwra-stoneman water dept' b'brookline mwra-brookline water dept' b'wakefield mwra-same as above' b'waltham mwra-waltham water division' b'watertown mwra-watertown water division' b'weston mwra-weston water dept' b'dedham mwra-dedham-westwood district' b'winchester mwra-winchester water sewer' b'winthrop mwra-winthrop water dept' b'boston mwra-boston water sewer co' b's. hadley mwra-south hadley fire dist' b'arlington mwra-arlington water dept' b'belmont mwra-belmont water dept' b'clinton mwra-clinton water dept' b'attleboro attleboro water dept' b'fitchburg fitchburg water dept' b'northampton northampton water dept' b'north adams north adams water dept' b'amherst amherst water division dpw' b'gardner gardner water dept' b'worcester worcester dpw, water oper' b'westboro westboro water dept' b'southbridge southbridge water supply co' b'newburyport newburyport water dept' b'hingham hingham water co' b'brockton brockton water dept' b'' b'maine' b'rockland camden rockland water co' b'bath bath water district' b'' b'new hampshire' b'keene city of keene' b'salem salem water dept' b'' b'vermont' b'barre city barre city water system' b'rutland city rutland city water dept' b'' b'new york' b'glens falls glens falls city' b'yorktown hts yorktown water storage dist' b'rochester rochester city' b'henrietta henrietta wd' b'rochester mcwa upland system' b'rochester greece consolidated' b'new york nyc-aquaduct sys (croton)' b'chappaqua new castle/stanwood wd' b'beacon beacon city' b'mamaronek westchester joint water works' b'' b'pennsylvania' b'bethlehem bethlehem public water sys' b'johnstown greater johnstown water auth' b'lock haven city of lock haven-water dept' b'shamokin roaring creek water comp' b'harrisburg harrisburg city' b'hazleton hazleton city water dept' b'wind gap blue mt consolidated' b'apollo westmoreland auth' b'fayettville guilford water auth' b'humlock creek pg&w-ceasetown reservoir' b'springbrook pg&w-waters reservoir' b'wilkes barre pg&w-gardners creek' b'wilkes barre pg&w-hill creek' b'wilkes barre pg&w-plymouth relief' b'altoona altoona city auth' b'tamaqua tamaqua municipal water' b'waynesboro waynesboro borough auth' b'pottsville schuykill co mun auth' b'' b'virginia' b'covington city of covington' b'fishersville south river sa dist-acsa' b'' b'south carolina' b'greenville greenville water sys' b'' b'michigan' b'sault ste marie sault ste marie' b'marquette marquette' b'' b'montana' b'butte butte water co' b'bozeman bozeman city' b'' b'california' b'san francisco city county of san fran' b'' b'nevada' b'reno westpac' b'' b'idaho' b'twin falls twin falls city' b'' b'washington' b'aberdeen aberdeen water dept' b'centralia centralia water dept' b'' b'-30-' b'--'
