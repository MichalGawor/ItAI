b'' b'' b' how about matt nokes run single against ron darling. was that a hit or what?' b' while watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding the' b" boss' talking about mark connor as bullpen coach. he said something like it's" b" mark connor's fault that the bullpen is so horrible!! here we go again!!" b' george sticking his non-baseball nose in the baseball business. shut up' b' george, just spend the money, get the players and leave buck and the coaches' b' and players alone.' b'' b'i saw that quote flashed on the screen yesterday also, and what enraged' b'me more than anything was not that george was speaking up agai and complaining' b'to the media instead of to the proper people, it was that the idiot reporter' b'provided george with an outlet and an opportunity to create trouble. this is a' b'supreme example of how the media can truly control situations. the local beat' b'reporters should know better and should stop trying to one-up each other with' b"quotes from the boss. if they just ignored him, he'd really simply go away," b'and problems would be avoided. what that reporter did was potentially to open' b'up the floodgates again--asshole.'
