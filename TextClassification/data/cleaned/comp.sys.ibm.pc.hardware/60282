b'' b'' b'' b"i'm using int15h to read my joystick, and it is hideously slow. something" b'like of my cpu time is being spent reading the joystick, and this' b'is in a program that does nothing but printf() and joyread().' b'' b'the problem is that a lot of programs trap int15h like smartdrv and' b'so it is a slow as hell interface. can i read the joystick port in' b"a reasonably safe fashion via polling? and that isn't platform or" b'clockspeed specific?' b'' b'the joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. how?' b'you send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long' b'it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit. this time' b'is proportional to the joystick position. obviously, since time' b'is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste' b'of time. if you wrote your own routine instead of the bios, it' b'would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.' b'' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'john a. slagel "my old man used to tell me, before he left this' b'(217) always get left behind." -the marlboro man'
