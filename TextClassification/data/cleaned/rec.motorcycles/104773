b'' b'my kawasaki kz l4 has millimetres of play on the gearchange' b'pedal axle, in other words, i can move the axle sideways up-and-down' b"for few millimetres to each direction. this doesn't bother me when" b"riding, but i guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. last summer i took the" b'bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned' b'that it should be an easy job. all i would have to do is to remove the' b'front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that i would find' b'there. well, upon a closer inspection i discovered that the gearchange' b"axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. it seems that, in" b'addition to removing the cover, i would have at least to remove the' b'sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.' b'' b'question would removing this small cover from the left side of the' b"engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (don't know the" b'exact term in english, sorry) b'' b'question has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some' b'other purpose does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine b'' b'thanks b'' b'teppo nieminen' b'dod b'zoo mc helsinki finland' b''
