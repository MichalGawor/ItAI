b'' b'heres a story of a saint that people might like to read. i got it from' b'a the morning star, and am posting it with the permission of the' b'editor.' b'' b'' b'saint aloysius gonzaga' b'' b'the patron of youth' b'' b'' b'the marquis gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the prince' b'gonzage. he wanted him to become a famous, brave and honoured' b'soldier. after all, he must carry on the great family name of' b'gonzaga. of course, he was to become far more famous, brave and' b'honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not in' b'the manner expected.' b'' b"saint aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy from" b'praying to god and meditating on the divine mysteries and the' b'life of our lord. she had little time for the pleasures of this' b'life. as saint aloysius\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother' b'more than his father.' b'' b"saint aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's" b'soldiers, but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he' b'fainted from shock. this shows his immense hatred of sin (what an' b'example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).' b'' b'about the time of his first holy communion (which he received' b'from the archbishop of milan, charles borromeo, whom himself' b'became a great saint), he con-secrated his purity to god and' b'asked the blessed virgin to protect his innocence for life.' b'' b"he wanted to share our lord's suffering to\tshow his reciprocal" b'love. he started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the' b'finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put pieces of' b'wood in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of god.' b'while he was in his early teens his father sent him (and his' b'younger brother) to the court of the spanish king, phillip b'obediently, he set out to make the best of it. he mixed in well' b'with the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,' b'intelligent and always had something interesting to say.' b'' b'' b'not long before this time, the great soldier-saint, saint\tigna-' b'tius of loyola, had founded the society of jesus (the jesuits)' b'towards which saint aloysius' b'' b'' b'-12-' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'began to have a yearning. when he finally told his father, the' b'marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.' b'' b'after a short time, his father sent him to the great cities in' b'order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even' b'' b'through these trials, saint aloysius grew in his desire for the' b'religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.' b'' b"the marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted his" b'son: "will you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-' b'ness?" "i will not, father," was the in-evitable reply.\t"then' b'leave from my sight and don\'t return until you change your mind!"' b'with tears clouding his eyes, the saint left the room to\tpray:' b'"tell me lord, what am i to do? tell me! tell me!" he knelt down' b'to flagellate himself as he had done several times before, but' b'this time\the was seen. the onlooker rushed to the marquis. this' b'at last brought the proud man to his senses. "the lord wants him,' b'the lord can have him." he gave his consent for his son to become' b'a jesuit.' b'' b'after some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a terri-' b'ble epidemic broke out in rome. all the hospitals were full and' b'could house no more, so the jesuits opened their own. saint aloy-' b'sius did all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare' b'the dying for a holy death.' b'' b'saint aloysius himself contracted the plague from\tcarrying and' b'nursing the sick. for three months he lay with a burning fever' b'and finally, on june 21st, he gave his soul\tto the lord' b'while gazing at a crucifix.' b'' b'let us invoke saint aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his' b'humility, purity and confidence in prayer.' b'' b'saint aloysius gonzaga, pray for us.' b'' b'- brendan arthur' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service of' b'others as a sword is to a soldier' b'' b'god bless' b'' b'from simon' b'lines: b'--' b'/----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\\' b'| simon p. shields programmer viva cristo rey b'| monash university college gippsland ph:+61 .jhs. b'| switchback rd. churchill. fax:+61
