b'' b' the best way of self injection is to use the right size needle' b' and choose the correct spot. for streptomycin, usually given intra' b' muscularly, use a thin needle guage) and select a spot on' b' the upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there).' b' clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. make' b' sure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when the' b" needle enters the muscle contrasted to the 'prick' when it" b' pierces the skin).' b'' b' ps: try to go to a doctor. self-treatment and self-injection should' b' be avoided as far as possible.' b'' b'the areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little' b'fat. i inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut. i can stick' b"it in at a degree angle, and barely feel it. i'm not fat, just" b'have a little gut. my legs however, are muscular, and i have to pinch' b'to get anything, and then i inject at about a degree angle,and it' b'still hurts. the rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and' b"muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be" b'best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey. although' b'some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent' b'irritation. when you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,' b'wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the' b"puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good. a way to prevent" b'irratation is to mark the spot that you injected. a good way to' b'do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the' b'spot. this helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,' b'and spacing the sites out accuartely (about apart.)' b'' b"this is from experience, so i hope it'll help you. (i have" b'diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)' b'' b'later,' b'david' b'--' b'david hahn' b'university of wisconsin milwaukee'
