b'' b'' b' simply put, i do not see any way that a "platonic essence" could have' b' any *real* existance. "essence" in the platonic sense does not have' b' any referent as far as i can tell it is just an imaginary concept' b' invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in' b' other ways.' b'' b'you are quite confident that essences do not exist. how do propose to' b'define beings? can a thing can be *one* without definition? can a being' b'have a definition and know essence?' b'' b'what about properties? do beings have properties? does god have' b'properties?' b'' b'does numbers exist in reality as abstract entities or do we invent them?' b'' b' thus, to me, the unity of god must be primary, and the triality must be' b' secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes' b' of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying god is one.' b'' b'see my post in alt.messianic about the possibilities of tri-theism from a' b'phiolosophical point of view.' b'' b'=====================' b'institute of higher education' b'university of georgia' b'athens, ga'
