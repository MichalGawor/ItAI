b'' b'i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex' b'polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw' b'concave self intersecting polygons.' b'this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that' b'simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.' b'complex (figure type polygons) can be a bit trickier.' b'' b'it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave/multi outline' b'algorithm, but not tremendously faster. i spent awhile implementing and' b'optimizing both flavors, and the convex turned out about faster. this is' b'all c (on hp pa-risc the compiler got the inner loop [shooting the span] as' b'fast as possible, as far as i could tell). for any sort of game the database' b'to render is known ahead of time, and can be made all convex. definitely the' b'way to go.' b'' b'p.s. sorry but my code cannot be made public domain....' b'jesse' b'--'
