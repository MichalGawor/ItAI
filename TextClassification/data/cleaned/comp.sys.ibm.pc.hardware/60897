b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'article is last):' b'newsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware' b'date: wed apr b'' b'the temp on my 486dx2/66 is over 96c (measured with a k-type thermocouple' b'and fluke dig thermometer). this is an "idle" temp not doing lots of' b'bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc. this' b'is in a micron computer, without heatsink.' b'' b'i recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but i might take the fan off. it' b'makes a horrible whine at times, and i wonder what the vibration is doing to' b'the pins on the cpu etc...' b'' b'--' b'rob scholten' b'end of file, press return to quit' b'' b'rob,' b"don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about weeks" b'of use, mine did...' b'as to the vibration well that something i thought about to as i have' b'a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. so i mounted the fan' b'on the case so that it just blows air at the cpu and its heatsink' b'instead. work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about' b'is after the whine goes away on the fan. if the fan should stop (burn out)' b'how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. thats what' b'you should be thinking about. i have the parts together but have not' b'had the time to assemble them as yet. but you build a thermistor controlled' b'circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a led when the temp. goes' b'above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. cheep to do if' b'you use radio shack junk under $5....think about that one for a while!' b'sam' b'--' b'gosh..i think i just installed a virus..it was called ms dos6...' b"don't copy that floppy..burn it...i just love windows...crash..."
