b'' b'in the new york times on sunday may 9th in the week in review' b'section there was a report of a group called "space marketing"' b'in atlanta, georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide' b'reflective earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large' b'and as bright as the moon and carry some sort of advertising.' b'there was an editorial about this in the times the following' b'tuesday.' b'' b'are others as upset about this as i am? i feel that a global' b'boycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a good' b'idea. perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries' b'around the world? do others agree?' b'' b'-david' b'' b'[relevant messages found on the net:]' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'newsgroups: sci.space' b'date: may gmt' b'organization: hks, inc.' b'distribution: world' b'' b'' b'' b"if you don't want to see space marketing put up orbiting billboards, write" b'them, or call them, and tell them so. you might also write your' b'congresspeople. space marketing can be reached at:' b'' b'attn: mike lawson' b'public relations dept.' b'space marketing' b'1495 atmbree rd., suite b'rosewell, ga b'(404)-442-9682' b'' b'--' b'hibbitt, karlsson sorensen, inc.\t\tvoice: b'1080 main st, pawtucket ri 02860\t\tfax: b'' b'[alternatively, you could try to find out who their clients' b'will be and tell *them* how you feel.]' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'newsgroups: sci.astro,sci.space,sci.misc,sci.environment,talk.environment' b'keywords: light pollution, advertisements' b'organization: digital equipment corporation' b'date: thu, may gmt' b'' b'international dark-sky association (ida), sent me information on where' b'you can write in regards to the proposed "billboards in the sky" and' b'asked me to post it:' b'' b'karen brown' b'center for the study of commercialism' b'1875 connecticut avenue, suite b'washington, d.c. b'u.s.a.' b'' b'telephone: b'fax: b'' b'please note that i have no involvement whatsoever with the csc.' b'' b'or ...!decwrl!verga.enet.dec.com!klaes' b'' b'"all the universe, or nothing!" h. g. wells' b'' b'ejasa editor, astronomical society of the atlantic' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'newsgroups: sci.space' b'date: may gmt' b'distribution: sci' b'organization: nasa/jsc/gm2, space shuttle program office' b'x-newsreader: tin [version pl8]' b'' b'[...]' b": that's roughly akin to saying let's let anaconda strip-mine" b': the grand canyon so that strip-mining can boldly go where no' b': strip mining technology has gone before because after all,' b': mining means profits, and profits mean technological advance-' b': ment, and technogical advancement means prosperity, and pros-' b': perity means happiness, and so to hell with the grand canyon b'' b'space advertisement in low earth orbit is very short term on the' b'order of a few years before the orbit decays.
