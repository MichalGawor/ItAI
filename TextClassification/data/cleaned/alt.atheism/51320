b'' b'the poster casually trashed two thousand years of jewish history, and' b'ken replied that there had previously been people like him in germany.' b'' b'i think the problem here is that i pretty much ignored the part' b'about the jews sightseeing for years, thinking instead that' b'the important part of what the original poster said was the bit' b'about killing palestinians. in retrospect, i can see how the' b'sightseeing thing would be offensive to many. i originally saw' b"it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others" b'might see it differently. i still think that ken came on a bit' b'strong though. i also think that your advice to masud khan:' b'' b"#before you argue with someone like mr arromdee, it's a good idea to" b'#do a little homework, or at least think.' b'' b'was unnecessary.' b'' b"that's right. there have been. there have also been people who" b'were formally nazis. but the nazi party would have gone nowhere' b'without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the' b'street who behaved as though casual anti-semitism was perfectly' b'acceptable.' b'' b"now what exactly don't you understand about what i wrote, and why" b"don't you see what it has to do with the matter at hand?" b'' b'throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit' b'assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual' b'anti-semitism. if i agreed with that, then maybe your speech' b"on why this is bad might have been relevant. but i think you're" b'reading a lot into one flip sentence. while probably not' b'true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets' b'thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the' b'state of israel.' b'' b"anyway, i'd rather be somewhere else, so i'm outta this thread." b'--'
