b'' b'effect that one of the ssrbs that was recovered after the' b'recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of' b'some sort rattling around apparently inside the case.' b'i heard a similar statement in our local news (utah) tonight. they referred' b'to the tool as "...the pliers that took a ride into space...". they also' b'said that a thiokol (sp?) employee had reported missing a tool of some kind' b'during assembly of one srb.' b'' b'i assume, then, that someone at thiokol put on their "manager\'s hat" and said' b'that pissing off the customer by delaying shipment of the srb to look inside' b'it was a bad idea, regardless of where that tool might have ended up.' b'' b'why do i get the feeling that thiokol "manager\'s hats" are shaped like cones?'
