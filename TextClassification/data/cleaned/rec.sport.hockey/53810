b'' b'' b'' b'the san francisco bay area media is reporting tonight that the detroit' b'red wings beat the toronto maple leafs can someone who is not' b'part of the media conspiracy against the leafs tell me how the game' b'really went (i am expecting a win for the leafs, shutout for' b'potvin, hat trick for andreychuk and a goal and assists for' b'gilmour). if the leafs really lost, how many penalties did whichever' b'biased ref was at the game have to call against the leafs to let the' b'red wings win?' b'' b'ah yes. california. did the san francisco bay area media report that' b'joe montana is rumoured to be the leading candidate to replace fired' b'san jose sharks coach george kingston? apparently montana is not only' b'coveted for his winning attitude, but as a playing coach he will be' b'expected to quarterback the powerplay.' b'' b'good comeback, rog. your quick wit and intelligence continues to' b'amaze everyone.' b'' b'--' b'john franjione' b'department of chemical engineering' b'university of colorado, boulder'
