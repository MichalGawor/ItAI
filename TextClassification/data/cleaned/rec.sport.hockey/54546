b'' b' who should get the hart?' b' gretzky, not in a million years. at least not this year.' b" he hasn't played all year." b" yzerman, though it would be nice, i don't think he'll get it, he's" b' consistent, but not well known. (thought he should be!)' b" mario. jesus no! it's bad enough for me just to utter the word" b" without being extremely sick and pissed off. they guy's a luber" b' to ramble. as you can see i hate mario.' b' pat walker' b' unb' b'' b"i'm not going to bother reprinting your pathetic excuse for a post. mario" b'fan, or not you have to respect what he can do with a blade. as for the' b'hart trophy, i guess winning the scoring title after being out twenty-four' b'days with cancer, then leading his team to the presidents trophy and' b"breaking the win streak record in the process shouldn't even qualify him" b"for the award. maybe next year he'll tend a few games when barrasso needs" b'a rest. be realistic, mario has earned every one of his accolades and' b'deserves all the attention that he gets. lose the jealous attitude and you' b'may start enjoying hockey at its finest' b'-maze'
