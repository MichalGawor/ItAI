b'' b'|' b'| this just a warning to everybody on the net. watch out for' b'| folks standing next to the road or on overpasses. they can' b'| cause serious harm to you and your car.' b'|' b'| (just a cliff-notes version of my story follows)' b'|' b'| 10pm last night, i was travelling on the interstate here in' b'| knoxville, i was taking an offramp exit to another interstate' b'| and my wife suddenly screamed and something large hit the side' b'| of my truck. we slowed down, but after looking back to see the' b'| vandals standing there, we drove on to the police station.' b'|' b'| she did get a good look at the guy and saw him "cock his arm" with' b'| something the size of a cinderblock, but i never saw him. we are' b'| very lucky the truck sits up high on the road; if it would have hit' b'| her window, it would have killed her.' b'|' b'| the police are looking for the guy, but in all likelyhood he is gone.' b'|' b'| i am a very good driver (knock on wood), but it was night-time and' b'| i never saw the guy. the police said they thought the motive was to' b'| hit the car, have us stop to check out the damage, and then jump us,' b'| and take the truck.' b'|' b"| please be aware of folks. and for your own good, please don't stop!!!!" b'|' b'| peace.' b'|' b'|' b'| b'| b'|' b'| b'|' b"| as long as we're on the subject... several years ago myself and two others" b'| were riding in the front of a toyota pickup heading south on interstate b'| north of seattle, wa. someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our' b"| windshield. not by accident i'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the" b'| overpass quickly to see who did it. we figured it was kids, reported it and' b'| left.' b'| a couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. he was' b'| in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. turned out there was' b'| a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. they caught the year old' b'| that did it. they put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do?' b"| i don't think i'll over forget this story." b'' b'in des moines, iowa, about a year ago, some kid dropped a rock from an' b'overpass and hit car just behind the windshield. it put a dent in the roof,' b'so i guess i was lucky it hit metal.' b'' b"it's frustrating that we can't do much. bother the city government to put" b'covers on all overpasses? slow down/speed up a bit when driving under all' b'overpasses in the city? i like the first better, but that will take time' b'and lots of people talking to the city governments.' b'' b'just another b'' b'--' b'bryan welch amateur radio: n0sfg' b'everything will perish save love and music.--scots gaelic proverb' b"disclaimer: it's all opinion. everything. so there."
