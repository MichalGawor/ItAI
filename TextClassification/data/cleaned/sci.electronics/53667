b'' b"this is a followup post to something i've written previously. several" b"people responded with good information, but i don't think i communicated" b'exactly what i am looking for.' b"i'm working on a custom i/o device that will communicate with a host" b'via rs-232. my custom circuitry will use an 80c186eb or ec cpu and require' b'about 64k of ram (preferably flash ram). in looking around, i see that lots' b'of people have engineered uart-cpu-rom-ram subsystems that are ready to be' b"interfaced to your custom i/o devices. it's been done so much, that it" b'would be best if i can avoid reinventing a system. it just needs to use' b'an 80c186 (or cpu, and be able to load a program from the host then' b"transfer control to that program. well, there's one other thing the rom" b'needs to know how to do. it should have routines to send and receive bytes' b'to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (dtr,rts,dts,cts).' b"everything i've seen is in the and up range. that's too much for" b'this application. i need something around the cpu has the uart' b"built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips. does anyone know a" b'company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain' b'circuitry i can use? thanks in advance for the info.' b'' b'rich' b''
