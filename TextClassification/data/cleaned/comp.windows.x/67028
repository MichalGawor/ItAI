b'' b"i have a peculiar color problem with macx, apple's macintosh x server." b"i'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. it's happened" b'with the current version and with version b'when some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows' b'are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server' b"to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors. it doesn't happen" b'for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some' b'motif clients.' b'' b'i expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap.' b'it therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors. this makes it look' b"ugly until it's window gets priority. then macx changes the colormap so that" b'the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications' b"are having to make do with it's colormap." b'' b'this is a problem with all color x servers (or at least all color xservers i have' b'seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.' b'my solution is usually to avoid colormap-greedy apps and display' b'applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather' b'than in color (if this is an option for the application).' b'' b'- doug shaker' b'voice:\t415/572-0200' b'fax:\t415/572-1300' b'mail:\tqualix group' b'1900 s. norfolk st., b'san mateo, ca b'' b'qualix maintains a mailserver with information files and demo' b'versions of products. if you would like more information on' b'uunet!qualix!qfacts). the email should take the following' b'form:' b'begin' b'send help' b'send index' b'end' b'name' b'address' b'phone' b''
