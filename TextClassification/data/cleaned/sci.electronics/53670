b'' b'excerpts from netnews.sci.electronics: 16-apr-93 re: what do nuclear' b' date: fri, apr pdt' b'' b" i really don't know where to post this question so i figured that" b' this board would be most appropriate.' b' i was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that' b' are ever present at nuclear poer sites. they look like cylinders' b' that have been pinched in the middle. does anybody know what the' b" actual purpose of those things are?. i hear that they're called" b" 'cooling towers' but what the heck do they cool?" b'great explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always' b'see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants. at' b'nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas' b'fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot' b"water. as i recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many" b'fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive' b'contamination.' b'' b'actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual' b"boiling-water reactor nuclear plants. (there's a gripe in the industry" b"that nuclear power uses vintage steam technology). so it's" b'more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system' b'as cold as possible. hence big cooling towers.' b'' b'oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they' b'usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the' b'way down to ambient. some plants do cool the condensers with water,' b'rather than air; as one canadian official, asked about "thermal' b'pollution" de-icing a river, said, "up here, we view heat as a resource".' b'' b'everybody runs closed-cycle boilers. the water used is' b'purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when' b'the water boils. purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than' b'cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.' b'' b'john nagle'
