b'' b'1. can low voltage lights be controlled with an x10 module by putting it' b'before the transformer? it seems to work, even the dimmer works. not very' b'reliable. will it damage the module? can it be done reliably?' b'' b'2. i put a motion switch (heath) to a low voltage light, it worked but now it is' b'broken, too much current? how can i get arround that?' b'' b'3. how can i increase the intensity of a light using the x10 pc computer' b'interface without having it go on first and then down. i am doing' b'my own programing, not the x10 program.' b'' b'thanks c. montenegro'
