b'' b'hi,' b'i am looking for some help in choosing a package' b'for a high-speed silicon adc (100mhz) currently being' b'fabricated. this is a phd research project and i have to test' b'the chip at speed on a pcb. i expect to have roughly b'packaged circuits and will do dc, low-speed and high-speed' b'testing using different set-ups for the test chip.' b'' b'i know for sure that a dip will not work' b'(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).' b'getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so' b'i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a' b'leadless chip carrier. the flatpack would be hard' b'to test since it has to be soldered on to the test' b'setup and i would spend loads of time soldering' b'as i kept changing the test chip. the leadless chip' b'carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may' b'not work at high speeds.' b'' b'does anyone out there have experience/knowledge' b'of this field i would greatly appreciate help! any ideas/' b'names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages' b'would help.' b'' b'p.s. the multi-layer fancy gaas packages seem like a bit' b'of overkill(?)' b'' b'--- seema varma'
