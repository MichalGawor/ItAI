b'' b"i'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a vga" b"monitor (an ibm sold w/ many ps/2's to be exact) on the mac lc iii." b'all of the vendors i have called say that the internal video will not work' b'on a true vga monitor but will work on a ibm compatible multisync like the' b"sony's or the nec monitors. i thought the vga capability of lciii was very" b'attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive vga monitors. am i' b'confused or are these vendors just not up to speed? has anyone used an' b'lciii with a non multisync vga monitor and if so where did you get your' b'adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat i would prefer to get a' b"apple monitor for these lciii's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an" b"ibm bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more lciii's we can" b"afford and the more ps/2's we can get rid of!" b'' b'charles kuehmann' b'northwestern university' b'steel research group'
