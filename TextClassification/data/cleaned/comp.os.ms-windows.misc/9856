b'' b'' b'dear friend,' b' the risc means "reduced instruction set computer". the risc usually has' b'small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase' b'the clock rate to have a high performance. you can read some books about' b'computer architecture for more information about risc.' b'' b'hmm... not that i am an authority on risc but i clearly remember' b'reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large.' b'the difference is in addressing modes risc instruction sets are not' b'as orthogonal is cisc.' b'' b'--' b'' b"theoretically supposed to be reduced.... not any longer. that's why everyone" b'is arguing about risc v.s. cisc. personally, i think cisc will win out.' b'just take a look at the pentium! (not that i like intel architectures either,' b"but that's another story...)" b'' b'bye!' b'' b'' b'do you mean that the pentium is better than a risc? or that it will outsell' b'them all? if the first, you have to remember that intel cisc (like the' b'pentium) are a always a generation away from the best riscs... also riscs' b'cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities (not' b'even on the same order)... but i remember reading about years (maybe b'about a t800(?) from hypercube that did a mips, was superscallar and' b'reordered its instruction itself so' b'' b"i'm not sure, but i think the t800 was a 25mhz transputer? so ya tie" b'a gazillion of them together to get 100mips. (the newest is the t9000' b"which kicks anyone's butt haven't seen them used much though)." b'' b'anyway, to respond, i think the pentium (cisc) is better than the more advanced' b'risc (e.g., like the alpha, etc. the 66mhz pentium has approximately the' b'same "performance" as the superduper 133mhz alpha here, performance is the' b'weird specint92 that everyone refers to? this is what i *heard* the' b"alpha still kicks in the p5's butt in fp again, this is what i *heard*)." b'and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and' b'make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though' b'you have a sucky architecture from over years ago (like intel b'' b'if you can make a "cisc" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast)' b'with the ideas behind the "risc" ideology, you got a cisc chip. and then' b"i admit i can't see the advantages of risc over cisc..." b'' b'if the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively' b'speaking).' b'' b"now i may sound like i like intel, but i'll have to say that the p5 is some" b'real kick butt pile of si and sio2...' b'' b"but i hope that motorola really catches up with the 68k line... or i'm gonna" b'start crying...' b'' b'brian' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'brian "hojo" lee "hey, excuse me miss, could i have a .gif of you?"' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
