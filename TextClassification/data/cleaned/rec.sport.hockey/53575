b'' b'(mathew tasalloti) says:' b'chances this year), but it seems to me like washington is the only' b'team that can stop the penguins from winning their next stanley cup.' b'' b' really? i think both the islanders and devils would have a better chance' b'at the penguins than the capitals, imo.' b'' b'really? what makes you think the islanders have a better shot? they' b"couldn't even beat the whalers in two games!" b'' b'yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the islanders play at' b'the talent level of their opponent. since hartford is pitiful, the' b'islanders played pitiful. since pittsburgh is great, the isles will most' b'likely play great. this is most likely due to inexperience and very poor' b"shooting. to greg: yes, i have noticed that the islanders couldn't hit" b'the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of' b"it. does anyone have shooting percentages? i don't know if that would" b'help, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some' b'light on the subject.' b'' b'and, my playoff pool is running!!! exact rules to be posted tomorrow, but' b"don't hesitate to send in picks!!!" b'' b'--' b"keith keller\t\t\t\tlet's go rangers!!!!!" b"let's go quakers!!!!!" b'' b'"when i want your opinion, i\'ll give it to you."'
