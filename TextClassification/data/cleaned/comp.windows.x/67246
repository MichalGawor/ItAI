b'' b': the application creates window with a button "quit" and "press me".' b': the button "press me" pops up a dialog box. the strange feature of' b': this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the' b': first time. if i try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th time),' b': it is *much* slower.' b':' b': the shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its' b': positioning request. the window-manager is not responding because' b': it thinks the window is already in the right place.' b':' b': exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to' b': me; all information greatly received.' b'' b'thanks for this clue, and thanks to derek ho also for a pointer in the' b'same direction.' b'' b'one solution, due to derek ho: when the popup is popped up, we setvalue' b'its location which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the' b'previous popup. the slow response can be avoided by calling getvalue' b'first, and only using setvalue if the required location is different.' b'the problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the' b'location of the popup, so that the setvalue really does change the' b'location of the popup. (we tried this just for a double check on the' b'source of the problem.)' b'' b'the solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:' b'' b'1) use "twm" or "mwm" rather than "olwm"' b'2) use "olwm", with resource "*wmtimeout: b'3) only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.' b'' b'this is obviously working around some bug somewhere.' b'' b'thanks chris ho-stuart'
