b'' b'' b'only brendan mckay, or maybe arf, would come to the rescue of nazi' b'racial theory. is it distressing brendan? the point is that any' b'eugenic solution to the jewish problem as elias has proposed smacks' b'of pure nazism. the fact that elias\' proposal cast the entire "problem"' b'as one of the abnormal presence of israeli society in the middle east,' b'and that he buried a slam against u.s. aid to israel in the midst of' b'his "even-handed" solution of the jewish question, made it obvious what' b'he had in mind: disolving the jewish polity. that *is* a nazi doctrine:' b'rectification of the "abnormal presence" of the jewish people within a' b'larger body politic. whether your "solution" involves gas, monetary' b'incentives to the poor jews to marry out, or as feisal husseini has' b'said, "disolve the zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal' b'surrounding arab culture," you are engaged in a nazi project.' b'' b'just as obvious is your statement: "i will not comment on the value' b'or lack of value of elias\'s proposal." still striking the glancing' b'blow, right brendan? you could easily see where he was going, but you' b'"will not comment." so, you are complicitous.' b'' b'what is your fascination with nazi racial theory, anyway?' b'' b'-- chris metcalfe ("someone else")' b'' b'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' b'' b'' b'a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle-east.' b'---------------------------------------------------------- by' b'\t\t\t elias davidsson' b'' b"5. the emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'" b'marriages in israel/palestine, all of whom would have relatives on' b"'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its" b'ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a' b"truly civil society. the existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of" b'people would also help the integration of israeli society into the' b'' b' sounds just like a racial theory that hitler outlined in mein kampf.' b'' b'someone else said something similar. i will not comment on the' b'value or lack of value of elias\'s "proposal". i just want to say' b'that it is very distressing that at least two people here are' b'profoundly ignorant of nazi racial doctrine. they were not' b"like elias's idea, they were more like the opposite." b'' b'nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation. an' b'instructive example is the nazi attitude to gypsies. according to' b'nazi theoreticians, gypsies were an aryan race. they were persecuted,' b'and in huge numbers murdered, because most european gypies were' b'considered not pure gypsies but "mongrels" formed from the pure gypsy' b'race and other undesirable races. this was the key difference between' b'the theoretical approach to jews and gypsies, by the way. it is also' b'true that towards the end of wwii even the "purist" gypsies were' b'hunted down as the theory was forgotten.' b'' b'brendan.'
