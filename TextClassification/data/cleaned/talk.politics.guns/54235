b'' b'' b'recently while looking around in traders sporting goods store, a very well' b'stocked firearms store, i discovered a printed document that was being' b'distributed by the good folks who work there. traders, btw, is located in' b'san leandro, ca.' b'.' b'.' b'.' b'the newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads which is why you no longer' b'see the ads that traders, san leandro, has run for many years.' b'' b'these ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for' b'sporting use or self-protection. they certainly have the right to do so, under' b'the second amendment right to bear arms.' b'' b"are you sure about this? i'm currently looking at a copy of last" b"thursday's sf chronicle and there is the typical one column traders" b'ad on page c7 in the sports section. not only that, but there is' b'a part in the middle which rather prominently says "wanted: we pay' b'cash for assault rifles and pistols.". granted, i haven\'t seen today\'s' b"paper yet. but i'd be surprised if there wasn't a traders ad in it." b"it's probably worth it to write to the chronicle (and other papers)" b'anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.' b'' b'by the way, let me put in a plug for traders. i have shopped all' b'over the sf bay area and i have never seen another store with lower' b'prices. and their selection is amazing.' b'' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------' b'lee gaucher my opinions.' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------'
