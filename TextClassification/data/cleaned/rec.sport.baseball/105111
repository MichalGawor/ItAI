b'' b'}' b"} i watched the final inning of bosio's no-hitter with several people at" b'} work. after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the' b'} middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he' b"} wouldn't have had time to throw riles out. yet, the throw beat riles" b'} by about two steps. i wonder how many others who watched the final out' b'} think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.' b'}' b"} in this morning's paper (or was it on the radio?), vizquel was quoted as" b'} saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still' b'} easily thrown out riles, that he barehanded it instead so as to make the' b'} final play more memorable. seems a litle cocky to me, but he made it' b"} work so he's entitled." b'' b'i guess so.' b"still, that's kind of a stupid move, imo. he'd be singing a different" b'tune if he had booted it, and the next guy up had hit a bloop single.' b'stranger things have happened (hey, i used to be a big dave stieb fan...)' b'and unfortunately, there\'s no such thing as an "unearned hit". b'' b'cheers,' b'' b'-*-' b'charles'
