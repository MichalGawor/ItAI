b'' b'i would like to know if there is any new information out there about the' b'subject or any new studies being conducted. i am confident in my' b'pediatrician and her communication with the people in chapel hill, but' b'since this is a life-long disorder and genetically transferred i would' b'like keep current. i do realize that since this is a relatively new' b'disorder (first documented in in a fertility clinic in scandanavia)' b'and is therefore "controversial".' b'' b'i do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with' b'"kartagener\'s syndrome", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome' b'in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic' b'infections. "situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrong' b'side of the body, and can be complete or partial. it is interesting' b'medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part' b'by the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in' b'absence of this, laterality can be "random." people with situs' b'inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their' b'rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they' b"can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong" b'side).' b'' b"according to harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal" b'recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four' b'in a family would be affected. but there may be much more current' b'information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking' b'about more than one conditiion. i would suggest that you ask your' b'pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of' b'which there is probably one at ncsu.' b'' b'-km'
