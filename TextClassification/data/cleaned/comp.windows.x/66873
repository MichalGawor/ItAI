b'' b'' b'' b'...let me point out that both gui-based word-processors and text-based' b'formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and' b'action-based, and the other symbol-based.' b'' b"true, but that's beside the point. this is a fact about an abstract model" b'of what the gui users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.' b'this abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*' b'of the system. (nb: some users may see it, too, but only when they put' b'aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)' b'' b"i'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. after" b"all, that's what i do, too! i am saying that ui designers must carefully" b'distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must' b'ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system.' b'' b'' b"i don't recall the actual stats, but something like in people can be" b'categorized as a "symbol manipulator".' b'' b'it would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this' b"claim. at any rate, i don't think this is evidence that of users think" b'like programmers. bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers b'these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol' b'manipulation. but what they do is not programming, and programming is not' b'required to do what they do.' b'' b'to restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;' b'no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.'
