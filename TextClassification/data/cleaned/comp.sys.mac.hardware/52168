b'' b'has anybody heard about a thing called a macwatch? i saw it on tv a' b'couple of years ago, it is a watch with a reviever and a transmitter for' b'your mac. the practical upshot is that your mac can page your watch and' b'display a small message. my flatmate is off to the states for a week or' b'two soon and i am interested in getting one. any info would be' b'appreciated.' b'' b'thanx in advance.' b'glenn.'
