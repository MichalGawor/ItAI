b'' b"now, my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's, but" b"i just ordered my first car with an auto trans. i wasn't planning on it; but" b'after driving a few i was convinced: things have changed since the days of' b'"slip \'n\' slide withe powerglide". they shift *better* than i do, there\'s no' b'clutch to wear out (honda wanted for my 4wd wagon last year!- got it done' b'for it only costs about in gas milage on the highway and it makes it' b'easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car b'' b'(oddly enough, while two of my best friends- both in the auto industry here in the' b'motor city- have switched wholeheartedly to autos, their wives *insist* on' b'manual. shift envy?)' b'' b"braggadocio aside, given today's technology and the warranties they're handing" b'out the auto trans seemed like an excellent choice. call me a convert.' b'' b'--mike' b''
