b'' b'' b' anyone know what would cause my iicx to not turn on when i hit the keyboard' b" switch? the one in the back of the machine doesn't work either..." b' the only way i can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes,' b' then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately...' b" sometimes this doesn't even work for a long time..." b'' b'tj' b'this problem is most likely the same that all cx users are experiencing....' b"thanks to one very adventurous usenet reader (sorry i can't remember the" b"guy's name! somebody please post it....he deserves the credit for saving" b'us all it is easily fixed, if it is the same problem......' b'' b'' b'best i can figure it is due to time, heat and repeated warmup/cool downs in' b'the power supply....i.e., bad solder joints in the power supply circuit' b'card. go get a desolder tool from radio shack, a low wattage iron and some' b'good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit' b'card with the ac plugs facing away from you..........or get someone to do' b'it for you. it took me less then minutes and saved me at least for' b'a new supply!'
