b'' b'| i have a problem which many of you might have run into. we use lots of' b'| ascii terminals and use them to the max. meaning lots of attributes, line' b'| draw, etc. now what i need to do is come up with a working xterm which' b'| will emulate our advanced ascii terminals as closely as possible.' b'|' b'| this means needing all attributes to work, including bold and line drawing.' b'| the only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in' b'| which one is bold and the other normal, while both have linedraw, fixed' b'| spacing, and several sizes.' b'|' b'| the only standard fonts which work are the fonts like 9x15 and 9x15b under' b'| "misc". they work great, except i need a font one size larger, 10x20. now' b'| 10x20 works well, but there is no bold counterpart!' b'|' b'| to make matters worse, i need the fonts in some form i can use for tektronix' b'| xterminals. it seems they like .pcf format, although i should be able to' b'| convert a .bdf format.' b'|' b'| anyone have any suggestions?' b'| b'| b'| mark a. davis lake taylor hospital norfolk, va (804)-461-5001x431 b'| b'' b'this would be tedious, but if you have the time you could get the .bdf' b"file (i can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access" b'to the x source), and could make your own bold font from this. since each' b'glyph is just a bitmap, you could write a program to convert each' b'glyph to a bitmap-readable file, use bitmap to make each glyph "bold", and' b'convert the results back to .bdf format. then, use "bdftopcf" to create' b'the .pcf file. then, stick the .pcf in /usr/lib/x11/fonts/misc (or wherever)' b"and include it in fonts.dir and, voila, you'll have what you need!" b'' b'--' b'ernie coskrey ncr corporation mcpd columbia' b'west columbia, sc b'"i\'m out there busting my buns every night. tell your old man to drag walton' b'and lanier up and down the court for minutes." roger murdoch, co-pilot'
