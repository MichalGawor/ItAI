b'' b'' b"i just thought i'd share a nice experience before my exam today." b'i was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked' b'me for any spare change i might have. i had a dollar or so that i gave her,' b'and not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (i generally give' b'a dollar as that will buy a little food at mcdonalds or something) i offered' b'her some "spiritual gifts," as i called them, rather than gifts of money.' b'i talked of how great i felt that god had made such a pretty day, and how' b'nice it was to give to people she then said she was getting married soon.' b'she talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have' b'even had a house, for all i know), but that they felt a very special love in' b'the lord, an unselfish kind of caring. it warmed my heart to know that b'people can have so little monetarily, and realize that spiritually they are' b'indeed very rich. a good lesson for all of us who say we want more, more,' b'more; what we really need cannot be counted, or sold, or bought.' b'--' b'"and when that one great scorer comes to mark against your name;' b'he writes, not whether you\'ve won or lost, but how you played the game"' b'--grantland rice'
