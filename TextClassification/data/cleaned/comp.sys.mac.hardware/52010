b'' b'' b'several weeks ago, i described a problem with my apple high-resolution' b'monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. to' b'recapitulate: occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor' b'momentarily loses sync. the entire raster image bounces down about an' b'eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. this usually happens right' b'after i close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that' b'radically alters the image on the screen. sometimes, though, it happens' b'with no provocation whatsoever.' b'' b'i have received a bewildering range of replies. at one extreme was' b'a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the' b'problem was that the monitor\'s power supply simply couldn\'t always' b'keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from' b"a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's" b'power supply. there was no fix available, he said, because nothing was' b'really wrong. (i guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that' b'it had to be endured.)' b'' b'this seemed quite persuasive and i would have been tempted to' b'adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a monitor' b'owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the' b'apple service technical procedures, volume under the heading' b'jitter correction. the section describes a fix involving the replacement' b'of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,' b'the swap of a circuit board.' b'' b'i would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had' b'experience with this sort of thing.' b''
