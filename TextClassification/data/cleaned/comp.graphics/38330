b'' b' b" some vesa bios's support this mode (0x100). and *any* vga should be able to" b' support this (640x480 by colors) since it only requires bytes.' b" my 8514/a vesa tsr supports this; it's the only vesa mode by card can support" b' due to 8514/a restrictions. (a wd/paradise)' b' b' b" i am not responsible for anything i do or say i'm just an opinion." b'' b' \tahh no. possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your' b' calculator. color modes take a byte per pixel so time is' b' which is 300k to be exact. 640x400x256 only takes 250k but i' b" don't think it is a bios mode. i wouldn't bet that all vga cards can do" b' that either. if a vga card has 512k i bet it can do both 640x400 and' b' 640x480. that by definition is svga, though not very high svga.' b'' b'' b'yes, i did punch in the wrong numbers (working too many late nites). i' b"intended on stating 640x400 is bytes. it's not in the bios, just my" b'vesa tsr.' b'' b'--' b"i am not responsible for anything i do or say i'm just an opinion."
