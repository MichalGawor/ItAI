b'' b'usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor' b'uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been' b'incredible.' b'any thoughts on the new (old) reds uniforms. i' b'remember seeing a pete rose rookie card, and unless i miss my' b'guess he was wearing the exact same duds.' b"the mets (how about doc's performance today?!!!!!) have" b'reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the mets' b'insgnia on the front of the jersey. to my knowledge it is the' b'first time that has been changed since and it reminds me' b'a little of the dodger logo.' b'many teams have opted for a return to a previous style' b'of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.' b'(phillies, reds, expos, white sox, padres, etc.) and the once' b'bright colors have been altered to gray. the trend has also' b'seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the' b'early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums' b'construcrted throughout the sixties.' b'with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one' b"in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the" b"horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it" b'was meant to be.'
