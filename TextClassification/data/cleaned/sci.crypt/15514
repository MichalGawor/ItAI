b'' b' now why is that? i doubt there is a trapdoor in skipjack. (but we will' b' never know). and i doubt the nsa would promote a mass market chip they' b" couldn't compromise. ergo, nsa is now capable of compromising (probably" b' with brute force keysearch) engines of the complexity of skipjack. look' b' at the specs. why, i bet they have thousands of little chips chugging' b' away in their crypto busters... maybe even tens of thousands. complexity?' b' not much more than a how many such machines will fit into fort meade?' b'' b' i think pgp2.3 should have bit idea keys...' b'' b'thousands? tens of thousands? do some arithmetic, please... skipjack' b"has possible keys. let's assume a brute-force engine like that" b"hypothesized for des: microsecond per trial, million chips. that's" b'10^12 trials per second, or about years for trials. well,' b'maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build' b'a machine with million chips. sure only years for each solution.' b'' b'idea uses 128-bit keys. shall i bother doing the calculations for you?' b"hint: multiply years by and you can't do idea at that" b"speed; key setup takes much too long. i wouldn't be surprised if that" b"were the case for skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing just" b"yet. des used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's" b'technology. modern chips can do a lot more.' b'' b'nsa may or may not know how to crack skipjack and idea (i doubt it for' b'the former; i have no idea for the latter, though it does seem to be a' b"strong cryptosystem). but it ain't gonna be by exhaustive search."
