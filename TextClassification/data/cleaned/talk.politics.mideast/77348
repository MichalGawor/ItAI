b'' b'' b'there are treaties signed between greece and turkey which speak about a' b'moslem minority in thraki and not of a turkish minority in thraki.' b'the reason they talk about moslems and not

thousand non-turkish muslims does not change the' b'essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger' b"turkish minority. the 'pomaks' are also a muslim people, whom all the" b'three
