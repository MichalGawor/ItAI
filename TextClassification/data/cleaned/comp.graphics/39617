b'' b'' b'i was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the pc that' b'will do compositing of a series of pictures?' b'' b'what i mean by "compositing" is, say i have a live video clip' b'(digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated' b'bird flying around the screen. i want to combine these two series of' b'pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, i want' b'the living room picture to show through. yes, i realize i can do this' b'with a genlock, and i do own a genlock, but i want to be able to do' b"manual compositing also. it's ok if i have to composite one frame at" b"a time; i assumed i'd have to do that anyway. but being able to" b'composite a series of frames would be even better.' b'' b"i've looked around and i haven't found a pc package that will perform" b'this. help, please!' b'' b'if you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation' b'into autodesk animator .fli or .flc format, autodesk animator will do' b'this for you. it can take one animation, make a certain color' b'"clear", and overlay it over another animation. i do not have a way' b'right now to convert .avi or .mpg files to animator files. animator' b'will also import a series of .gif files to create an animation, so if' b'your video capture stuff can create this is might work.' b'' b'-vance gloster'
