b'' b'' b'unfortunately h. beam piper killed him self just weeks short of having his' b'first book published, and have his ideas see light.. such a waste.' b'' b'' b'piper lived in my town (williamsport, pa) when he killed himself. it' b"was in the early '60's. he had had more than a few books published by" b'that time, but he was down on his luck financially. rumor was that he' b'was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food. he viewed himself as' b'a resourceful man, and (imo) decided to check out gracefully if he' b"couldn't support himself. the worst part is that john campbell, the" b'long-time editor of astounding/analog sf magazine had cut a check for' b"piper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail. if campbell" b"had known piper's straits, i'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on." b'campbell was like that.' b'' b"i wish it had happened differently. i always enjoyed piper's stuff." b'' b'doug loss' b'' b''
