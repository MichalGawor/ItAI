b'' b"i've found a problem in the use of xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. i" b'decided to implement an animated cursor (using created cursors) by calling' b'xdefinecursor from a sig_alrm signal handler. this is used to indicate we are' b'waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).' b'i was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring' b'the standard cursor when complete. i found dumped core and upon analysis' b'it was when the sig_alrm handler was called during a xdrawstring call. xdrawstring' b'was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the xdefinecursor' b'was called. presumably the (internal) structure that xdrawstring was manipulating' b"was not in a stable state and sent xdefinecursor to where it shouldn't have been." b'' b'has anyone else experienced this? is there any official documentation that' b"says you should ensure this doesn't happen? or should bcopy() be atomic." b'we are running on sgi irix with x11r4.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'regards, martin' b'' b'/\\/\\ martin visser electrical software engineer' b'/ engineering technology department' b'/ bhp steel slab and plate products division' b'/ p.o. box wollongong nsw australia' b'\\ phone ext. b'\\ fax
