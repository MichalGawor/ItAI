b'' b'' b'i have one of these monitors. it appears to function ok, but is unhookable' b'to anything standard (cga,ega,vga) it will plug in but gives fuzzy' b'diagonal noise.' b'i also have a graphics board that is apparently a graphic board' b'(double card with 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector' b'with a picture of monitor). i tried plugging these two into a standard at' b'to no avail. how can one connect these to (the monitor seems to' b"be of relatively high quality, so i'm curious)? any special drivers and/or" b"setup needed i can't locate any jumpers on the card."
