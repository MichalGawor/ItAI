b'' b' i have heard many things about the ati ultra pro card. some have' b' been positive but most are negative. could people please confirm' b' these? (i am interested in the eisa version in particular).' b'' b' the card does not work in a system with 32m ram.' b'' b'the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only, as far as i know. the vlb' b'and eisa version should have no problems.' b'' b' the card works in a 32m system with some switches' b' set but it is much slower.' b'' b'again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124m ram' b'(eisa and vlb) or m (isa). 32m should not be a problem for you.' b'' b' the card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.' b'' b'nope. i can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all' b'non-interlaced.' b'' b' the latest build drivers still do not work in many' b' cases.' b'' b"they aren't perfect, but are much improved. i don't recall the last time which" b'i had to leave mach mode (ati gup mode) and switch to or vga mode due' b'to software incompatibility.' b'' b' this card is the fastest full colour card for the money.' b'' b"it's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate." b'' b' this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. b'' b'i like it.' b'' b'--' b'the university of texas at austin |\t decnet: utxvms::dcoleman'
