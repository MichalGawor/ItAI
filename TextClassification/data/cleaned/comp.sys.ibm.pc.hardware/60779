b'' b'' b'hi everyone,' b'i have a question regarding my stack on my pc. i am programming' b'in turbo c and my program is rather large (model large too). i keep' b'getting errors that i am running out of memory after a while of running the' b'program. when i compile the program, it says i have meg of ram so' b"i can't seem to explain why it crashes." b'' b'all it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and' b'after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. this leads' b'me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.' b'' b'does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions' b'that do not return anything??' b'' b'i have been working on this problem for days and i would really' b'appreciate any responce. if this is not the correct newsgroup, i will' b'gladly re-post, but this is the only i could find.' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'sean mars' b'carroll college' b'waukesha, wi' b''
