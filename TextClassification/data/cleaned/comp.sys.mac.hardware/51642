b'' b'i too have been watching the iisi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in' b'the next few weeks. the plan i have is to build a small board with a few' b'different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different' b'speeds using a front pannel switch. this way i can get the speed when' b'i want but i can also run at slower (stock) speeds it i experience any' b"compatability problems with any applications. i don't expect to be able" b'to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if i can switch' b'without any lock-up problems, then i could switch to 33mhz when needed' b'and put it back to idle mhz) when not needeed. this would further' b'reduce the wear-and-tear on the cpu even with a heat sink. of course' b'i would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch' b'but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and' b'route it directly to the mother board.' b'' b"i haven't started probing around inside my si yet. does anyone know the" b'voltage level to power the crystal oscilators?' b'' b'thanks.' b"<<< these statements are mine and not boeing's b'' b''
