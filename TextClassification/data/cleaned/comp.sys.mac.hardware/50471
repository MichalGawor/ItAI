b'' b'does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to' b"apple's specs that forces the external output on lc's and the powerbook's" b'160/180 and duo into a true vga style output signal? the nec adapter does' b'not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into' b'the correct pinout but do not switch the macs output into vga mode.' b'' b'do i have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??' b'' b"the following is the apple spec for the lc cpu vga cable adapter. i'm assuming" b'that the powerbooks/duos will work with the same adapter(?);' b'' b'' b'macintosh lc to vga' b'' b'the macintosh lc can supply a x vga timed signal for use with vga' b'monitors by using an adapter cable. the standard macintosh lc supports vga to' b'16 colors, and with the optional 512k vram simm, the vga monitor is supported' b'to colors.' b'' b'note: the macintosh lc supplies signals capable of driving ttl level' b'inputs. however, some low impedance input vga monitors do not work' b'with the macintosh lc.' b'' b'to connect a macintosh lc to a vga monitor, you need to make an adapter cable' b'from the macintosh lc video connector to the vga monitor. following is the' b'pinout description for the adapter cable:' b'' b'macintosh lc vga' b'video connector pin signal name' b'--------------- b'1 red ground' b'2 red video signal' b'5 green video signal' b'6 green ground' b'9 blue video signal' b'13 blue ground' b'15 /hsync' b'12 /vsync' b'14 hsync ground' b'7,10 nc sense1 sense2 tied together' b'' b'vga monitors are identified by shorting pin to pin on the macintosh lc' b'video connector. the macintosh lc grounds pin on its video connector, which' b'results in pulling down pin and gives the correct monitor id for a vga' b'monitor.' b'' b'***************************************************************************' b'this message was created on mcw bbs a jointly supported by' b'new orleans mac user group national home school user group' b'***************************************************************************'
