b'' b'' b'' b'i have a request for those who would like to see charley wingate' b'respond to the "charley challenges" (and judging from my e-mail, there' b'appear to be quite a few of you.)' b'' b'it is clear that mr. wingate intends to continue to post tangential or' b'unrelated articles while ingoring the challenges themselves. between' b'the last two re-postings of the challenges, i noted perhaps a dozen or' b'more posts by mr. wingate, none of which answered a single challenge.' b'' b'it seems unmistakable to me that mr. wingate hopes that the questions' b'will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the' b'subject. given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, i' b'would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers,' b'in the following manner:' b'' b'1. ignore any future articles by mr. wingate that do not address the' b'challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he' b'refuses to do so.' b'' b'--or--' b'' b'2. if you must respond to one of his articles, include within it' b'something similar to the following:' b'' b'"please answer the questions posed to you in the charley challenges."' b'' b"really, i'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, i just want some" b"honest answers. you wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to" b'ask from a devout christian, would you?' b'' b'nevermind, that was a rhetorical question.' b'' b'--dave wood'
