b'' b'hello' b'' b'i have recently suffered from various problems concerning' b'an adaptec 1542a controller.' b'' b'problem b"floppy disk drive doesn't work. there's apparently at least two jumpers" b'on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. unfortunately i' b'have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). i would like' b'to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they' b'are located.' b'' b'problem b"my hard disks refuse to boot. with my two scsi hd's (rodime, miniscribe)" b"i get a message 'missing operating system', even though the disks have been" b'formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating' b'system on them. if i boot from a quantum i might get as far as getting' b'the ms-dos version information. this might of course be due to incombatible' b'memory drivers.' b'are there any jumpers that could affect the hd causing such errors?' b'' b'thanks in advance' b'' b'jouni' b'' b'_______________________________________________________________________________' b'jouni marttila yo-kyl{ b turku, finland
