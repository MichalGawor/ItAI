b'' b'has anyone had any success or experience with the hp deskwriter v3.1' b'drivers? the new driver has a nice "save as default" option which claims' b'to record your paper size, font substitution settings etc. for future' b'' b'has it happened to anyone that while printing a beep is heard and a' b'message is displayed of the sort "such-and-such a window was closed' b'because the finder did not have enough memory"? or am i the only one' b'suffering from this delusion?' b'--marc bizer'
