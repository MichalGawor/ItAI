b'' b" i've a mazda with about miles on it. recently i do not get" b' a good feeling of the road, esp. on a wet pavement when driving the car.' b' it feels as if the car is wandering and there is no grip on the road.' b' the tires are the original ones and have threads on them (passes the' b' penny head test). i had the shocks and struts and alignment checked and' b' things are fine. however i feel like that i dont have the grip of the' b' road and feel as if the car is wandering esp. on turns. any help' b' in this is appreciated. thanks.' b'' b'' b'two shots at it: check the tires again if you can see the wear bars,' b"you're down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the" b"bars that's no guide at all). your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning." b'you may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the' b'tire so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.' b'' b'(2) tires age. in particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put' b"them thru more heat cycles. harder compounds don't grip as well as" b'soft ones. effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very' b'often, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.' b'' b'bob benson' b''
