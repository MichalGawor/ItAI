b'' b'' b"greetings. i've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators" b'and learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies...' b'(before anyone flames me, i know, both have their place b'' b"anyways, i've built the basic up down converters with pretty" b"good results efficiency) but i'm running into problems" b'when i try to design build anything that puts out serious' b"bench) but something puzzles me: i'm using a simple choke as" b'the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)' b'but all commercial models use transformers with many windings.' b'i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for' b'the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose' b'me... what are they for? better than that, anyone have a full' b"schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of? i'd" b'love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such' b'low volume b'' b'my other problems (in getting high amps good efficiency) are' b'1) lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and b"limited knowledge of the whole topic... i'm doing this on my" b'own (not school) mind you (in fact, i have yet to take any' b'course that covers transistors b'' b'so, is the answer to the accumulation of dead commercial' b"models and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not what" b"i'm doing now...) and getting understanding schematics" b'and a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory?' b'' b'take care.' b'' b'more than feet (of gauge) but less than feet.' b'would like to have a working model in a year or so... b'(do i have a chance to make it?)' b'--' b'| all ideas are mine but they can be yours for only so respond now!!!! b'| i live for my ee major, winsurfing, programming, sca, and assorted dreams. b'\\ 200mb drive linux has 100mb and ms-dos has 100mb. ms-dos is worried
