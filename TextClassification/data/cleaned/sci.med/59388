b'' b'dear netters:' b'' b'maybe one of you can explain this. from time to time i experience' b'a strange kind of feeling (i have all kinds of weird feelings) which' b'can be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that one' b'experiences in a descending elevator. needless to say, it is not' b'enjoyable. it sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme' b'fatigue. it lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts' b'that long, it makes me sweatening.' b'' b'initially i called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until i later learnt that' b'the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats.' b'' b'so, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am i a stragne person?' b'i always believe i am unique.' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'ping' b'' b'' b'' b''
