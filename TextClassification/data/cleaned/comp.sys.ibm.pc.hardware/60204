b'' b'' b"it depends on what you'd like your joystick for. i've seen gravis" b"joysticks at radio shack. they seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my" b"hand. i have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than" b'a year) on flightsims. one redeeming feature does seem to be the ability' b'to adjust the tension of the stick.' b'' b"i recently purchased a ch flightstick. there aren't any suction cups and" b'no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.' b"i'm currently using it for the wing commander series and red baron. works" b'quite well. the large base does not require a steadying hand and so' b'leaves it free. the buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear' b'and feel them well). there are other models made by ch that can go up or' b'down in features.' b'' b'for price comparison gravis analogue joysticks sell for here' b'compared to the i paid for a ch flightstick. i think the extra' b'$10.00 is worth it just in feel. best thing to do is to ask a salesperson' b'to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.' b'' b'just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something' b"that needs sensitive touch. if you're only playing games such as castle" b'wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,' b"down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into" b"a gravis gamepad. they look like a nintendo control pad but i don't know" b'much beyond that.' b'--' b'will christie aatchoo! philosophy: the principles and' b'university of manitoba uh-oh... science of thought and reality' b"winnipeg, mb, canada i'm leaking philosopher: someone who thinks"
