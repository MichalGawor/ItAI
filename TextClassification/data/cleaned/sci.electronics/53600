b'' b" so.. here's my question. it seems to me that i'd have the" b' same electrical circuit if i hooked the jumper from the neutral' b" over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding outlets." b" what's wrong with my reasoning here?" b'' b'what you can do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is' b'to use a gfci outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper). in fact,' b'depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a gfci may be *required*.' b'' b'you still need to supply a proper ground for a ground fault circuit interrupter!' b'so rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to' b'a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.' b'' b'as jamie said, gfci devices are required by code in a number of places, most' b'notably: bathrooms, and outside the house. i do suggest the use of gfci outlets,' b'rather than the breakers. you will end up with much less headaches. noise pickup' b'in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.' b'' b'gfci devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them' b'regularly (using the test button).' b'' b'running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, i' b'have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check' b'their common sense list. please exercise caution.' b'---' b'gary gendel' b'vice president:\t\t\t\tcurrent consulting assignment:' b'genashor corp\t\t\t\tmentor graphics corporation' b'9 piney woods drive\t\t\t15 independence boulevard' b'belle mead, nj 08502\t\t\twarren, nj b'' b'phone:\t(908) 281-0164\t\t\tphone:\t(908) b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
