b'' b'just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (ap, etc.) that' b'there were several witnesses to bd folks starting the fires. it has also' b'been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which' b'rules out a bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.' b'' b'consider this: the bds had more than one lamp; the tanks made more than' b'one hole in the building. did anyone else notice on the video that it' b'appeared that wherever there was smoke coming out of the building, there' b'was a tank nearby?' b'' b'the fact that it appears that fires started in several places does not' b'rule out anything.' b'' b'also, where are these several witnesses? the way i heard it (from the fbi' b'spokesman on cnn) the "witnesses" were all people driving the tanks.' b'' b"one other point, i'm no fan of janet reno, but i do like the way she had the" b'"balls" to go ahead and take full responsibility. seems like the waffle boy' b'had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.' b'' b'too bad nothing will happen to her or him. the fbi and the media have' b'done their job well.' b'' b'dwayne jacques fontenot'
