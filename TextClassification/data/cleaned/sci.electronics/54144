b'' b'' b'in order to emit blue light, a semiconductor must have a band gap energy' b'within the region of to electron volts. according to my physical' b"electronics prof, you can't get an led with that band gap. that's why you" b"don't find blue leds or, for that matter, some other colour of leds. that" b"is not to say that blue leds can't be found. i've seen 'blue' leds sold," b'but they were just your typical visible light led in a blue plastic covering.' b"they didn't emit very much light..." b'' b'um...' b'' b'1) your professor if just plain wrong. although blue leds are one heck of' b'a lot less efficient than red ones.' b'2) "typical visible light leds" don\'t really exist. leds have a fairly' b'narrow region of transmittence. (since the fermi energy around either side' b'of the band gap falls off exponentially, blah, blah...)' b'' b'source: solid state electronic devices (ben g. streetman, 3d ed., prentice' b'hall)' b'' b'you might want to check the copyright date on that. b'' b"blue leds most certainly do exist, i've got a bunch at work. cree research" b'makes them (probably along with other companies... cree is big in' b'materials science, though; they advertise in the stuff like physics today,' b'etc.). you can buy them from jameco (i think), digikey (definitely), and' b'plenty of other distributors.' b'' b'actually, these days you _can_ get a "typical visible light" led it\'s' b'called a "rainbow led", and i\'ve forgotten who makes it (they advertise in' b'edn and many of the other trade rags, though). it combines a reg, green,' b'and blue led all on one chip (and has four leads). nifty device, although' b"it's probably fairly expensive." b'' b'---joel kolstad'
