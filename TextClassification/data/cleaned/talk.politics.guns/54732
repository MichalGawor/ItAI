b'' b'i have been at a shooting range where' b'gang members were "practicing" shooting.' b'' b'how do "we" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops' b'or even law-abiding menacing minorities. btw why the sneer quotes?' b'' b'"we" know because the area that the gun shop/shooting range is in is right on' b'the border of the west side of chicago. that is a gang infested area.' b'' b"so? kratz was there does that mean that he's a gang member?" b'' b'even in the most gang-infested areas, most of the residents are not' b'gang-members.' b'' b'that only minorities have gangs? not so. as far as the quotes are concerned' b"it was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship." b'' b'how was it obvious? were they not trying to hit the target? or, does' b'kratz confuse "marksmanship" with "trying to simulate a post"? if so,' b'that excludes self-defense shooting, but the rest of us understand' b'that that exclusion would be an error. (it excludes a lot of legit' b'"gun games" as well.)' b'' b"don't know about you but i have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by" b'taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.' b'' b'sounds like practical pistol or maybe ipsc. it also sounds like how a' b'self-defense shooter might well practice. the only things that action' b'excludes are hunting and "like a post" shooting. kratz should get out' b'more often.' b'' b'-andy' b'--'
