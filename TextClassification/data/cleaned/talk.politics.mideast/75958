b'' b'[...}' b'any concentration/labor camp in turkey (around or' b'later) for cypriot greeks (or any greeks) rather than talking' b'nonsense like above, i will be glad to read what they got.' b'' b'how can you be in a position to know about any kind of concentration camps' b'akgun?' b'' b'living through those days at the age of and following' b'the internal and external news gives me that knowledge' b'and position. in turkey had a democratic goverment and free' b"press at that time. forget about internal news agencies, i haven't" b'heard anything from any international source about any' b'concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey.' b'however, i heard adana pow camp. it was not secret and well' b'recognized pow camp.' b'' b'as for all the registered prisoners to the red cross having returned to' b'their homes, this is your version of the story. there are cases in which' b'prisoners who were registered, some of them even sent messages to their' b'relatives, were not released. these are undeniable facts.' b'' b'i see, they vanished in turkish labor camps. turks have' b'decided to acknowledge their existence first but later' b'changed their minds releasing them. is that it? what do' b"you think happened to them? i thought that mia's are only the subject" b'of rambo and chuck noris movies. seems that i am wrong.' b'' b'' b'as for their treatment being according to what convention...?' b'okay we believe you.' b'' b"you don't need to belive me. turkiye was never a clandestine state" b'in its history, it has been a respected and continuous member of un' b'since the inception of un. no body ever questioned the un membership of' b'turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after. only a short' b'lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the' b'internal greek loby. i know what you would say next. let me answer it' b'before wasting anytime. yes! un had a few condemning resolutions' b'against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem, especially after' b'the coup. well, us and israel had a few too. what can i say?' b'i am sure during athens junta duruing greeks had' b'their own share too.' b'' b'closed matter today between turkish cypriots/turks/greeks/greek' b'cypriots. there is no more any official demand from greek' b'cypriots about any missing greek cypriots.' b'' b'where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the' b'missing persons?' b'' b'have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks' b'mediated by gali? there was no issue whatsoever about any' b'missing people among the negotiating parties. was there?' b'i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and' b'international press. he keeps saying that "this was no' b'longer an issue for peace talks." also, you don\'t want' b"me fish for the greek cypriot politician's words (that argic" b'had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as' b'a greek-cypriot myth. seems that there is a different opinions' b'among greek-cypriots as well about missing people in turkish' b'custody.' b'' b'[..]' b'' b'your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed' b"in the period between the coup d'eta and the invasion, days, is simply" b'not true. all the cases of missing persons i know, and i know quite a' b'few, are cases of people who were either in the reserve forces and were lost' b'somewhere in the battlefield, or were civilians who were taken prisoners' b'in their villages by the turkish army.' b'' b'i am not claiming anything. i just told you what was' b'given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish' b'goverment/turkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some' b'of their own between july and the final cease-fire in' b'late august, this answer seems to satisfy the international' b'community, the un, and the vasilu goverment (since he did not make it' b'an issue for the peace talks). also, i am not aware of any un' b'condemnation against turkey about any missing greek-cypriot. are you?' b'' b"btw, do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta" b'and nobody got hurt in those events?' b'' b'' b'as of the few photos which you refer to, there are more than a few. there are' b'photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being "rounded up", but also others' b'in the prison camp in turkey.' b'' b'like i said before. there is even a different opinion among' b'greek-cypriots for this myth. the officers in turkish army who' b'governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes' b"to cover up their tracks i hope turkish army does't have" b'same type of morons for the security of turkiye. however, this must' b'a good subject for a movie script. one should inform oliver stone' b'about this.' b'' b'' b' of course, not. the justice was served well. if and when the bosnian' b"pleas are answered, who's going to dare to ask what happens to those" b'masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing idea. they are known today' b'(as eoka-b masterminds were known in to everybody and are doing' b'it openly even giving tv interviews. it may take same time as it was' b'for the eoka-b case, however, the justice will be served again.' b'' b'akgun, comparing the actions of the serbians in bosnian with the' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'actions of' b'^^^^^^^^^^^' b'turkey in cyprus is not something i would do if i were a turk.' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'i thought' b'that the serbians were the savages, the inhumane beasts etc etc.' b'' b'c. akgun' b'' b'michalis syrimis' b'' b'' b'if this is what you understood from the paragraph above,' b'you better let your computer system administrator check' b'the character conversion tables in your system. if yours are' b'ok, i should inform mine b'' b'c. akgun'
