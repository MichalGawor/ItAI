b'' b'' b"i don't know anything about this particular case, but *other*" b'governments have been known to follow events on the usenet. for' b'example after tienanmien square in beijing the chinese government' b'began monitoring cyberspace. as the former director of peacenet,' b'i am aware of many incidents of local, state, national and' b'international authorities monitoring usenet and other conferences' b'such as those on the institute for global communications. but' b"what's the big deal? you shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this" b'medium in any case. if you are concerned about being monitored,' b'you should use encyrption software (available in igc\'s "micro"' b'conference). i know for a fact that human rights activists in the' b'balkan-mideast area use encryption software to send out their' b'reports to international organizations. such message *can* be' b'decoded however by large computers consuming much cpu time, which' b"probably the turkish government doesn't have access to." b'' b'howard frederick, university of california, irvine department of' b'politics and society' b''
