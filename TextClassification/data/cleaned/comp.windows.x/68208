b'' b'' b"i've run into a bit of a snag while trying to get mac x up and running and would appreciate" b'any responses from anyone who may have seen this problem.' b'' b'on my local network, i have a number of macs, suns and sgi machines.' b'' b'i have installed macx/mactcp on all of the macintoshes and can run xclients on the sgi machines' b'all the live-long day. the problem is when i try to run an xclient on any sun, i setup' b"the command in macx, then execute it. nothing happens, i don't even get any command output." b'' b'now, i thought it might be a routing issue, but i can run remote xclients on the suns from my sgi' b'machines, as well as vice-versa. i can also run remote xclients on sgi machines that' b'are not on my local net here, but the above problem holds true for non-local suns as well.' b'' b'rejected, so here it is:' b'' b'here is an extract from the readme file that comes with macx:' b'' b'users of remote commands with sun machines may find that their remote commands' b'appear to do nothing and there is no output from the sun machine. this is due' b'to a feature of the sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from' b'requesting machines that are not known to the sun|s network address (/etc/hosts' b'or nis hosts) database. to successfully use remote commands with a sunos-based' b'machine, there must be an entry in the network address database for the' b'macintosh which is running macx.' b'' b'--' b'' b'stan kerr' b'computing communications services office, u of illinois/urbana'
