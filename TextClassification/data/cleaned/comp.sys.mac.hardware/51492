b'' b'does anyone work with the a/rose card?' b'' b'we have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the' b'system, and lets crash the mac then.' b'' b"okay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate" b'errors in the before every instruction some specified registers are' b'masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.' b'' b'normally, the "crash instance" of a/rose notices a crash, sets a flag and' b'stops working. by reading the mentioned flag the mac can notice a card' b'crash. that works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the' b"card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system." b'' b'the documentation of a/rose does not tell us anything about its behavior' b'when crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing' b"the assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy." b'' b'so, can anyone help?' b"please only reply via email, as i don't read this group." b'--' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'_ department of computer science iv' b'/ university of dortmund, germany' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'"in the beginning god created adam ahem! atoms. atoms of hydrogen."' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------'
