b'' b'another article that fell between the cracks:' b'' b'as evidence for the resurrection, it is often claimed that the disciples' b'were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce' b'their claim that jesus had come back from the dead.' b'now, i skimmed acts and such, and i found a reference to this happening' b'to stephen, but no others. where does this apparently very widely held' b'belief come from? is there any evidence outside the bible? is there any' b"evidence *in* the bible? i sure haven't found any..." b'' b'briefly, no. there is widespread folklore, but no good documentary' b'evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the apostles.' b'further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is "no' b'martyrs for a lie": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather' b'than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief. this adds the' b'quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered' b"the chance of life by recanting. since we don't even know how or" b"where they died, we certainly don't have this information. (by the" b'way, even in the case of stephen it is not at all clear that he could' b'have saved himself by recanting). the willingness of true believers' b'to die for their belief, be it in jesus or jim jones, is' b'well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little. [see' b'1kings18:20-40 for a biblical account of the martyrdom of priests' b'of baal].' b'' b'' b'--' b'these are my opinions. for a nominal fee, they can be yours.'
