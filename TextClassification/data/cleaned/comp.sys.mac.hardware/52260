b'' b'i have the logitech hand scanner for the mac. it uses a scsi' b'interface box that the standard scanner unit plugs into. i' b"have tried my friend's ibm hand scanner with the scsi box and" b'it works. see if you can get logitech to sell you the scsi' b'box by itself. warning: most of the cost of mac handscanners' b'is contained in the scsi interface box, so it could run up' b'to around when i upgraded my old style scanner to' b'the new gray scale model, it cost they just gave me a new' b'scan head and software; the box was the same. the gray scale' b'scanner interface runs about making it around for' b'the interface.' b'' b'collin' b''
