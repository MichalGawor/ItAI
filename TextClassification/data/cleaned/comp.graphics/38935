b'' b'' b'i am considering creating a "demo" for the ibm pc for my band.' b'i would like to combine interesting graphics and a sample of' b'my music in the program. i have seen things like this' b'done for other platforms, and even a few for the pc, but since' b"i'm completly new to this, i have no idea wher to start." b"i'm pretty sure that i am not skilled enough to put this" b'together, but i was hoping that you (collectivly) could' b'a. let me know what issues i need to worry about, things i' b'should take into consideration when developing the' b'concept.' b'b. perhaps someone knows of a programmer/artist who would be interested' b'in this type of a project.' b'' b'i know these are rather broad questions, but any information' b'would be most helpful. thanks!!' b'' b'--' b'gregory winer'
