b'' b'interestingly enough, in designing the escrow, we may want to use some' b'rather unusual technology, such as sealed boxes of paper, or' b'destructive read memory, rather than typical computer databases, which' b'is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys.' b'' b'the greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk,' b'would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out. you' b'can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete' b'copy is always possible. storing it on paper or something very hard' b"to copy at once may actually make sense. or a medium that can't be" b'copied for example, something with very slow access times or which' b'leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.' b'' b"of course then it's hard to backup. however, i think the consequences" b'of no backup the data is not there when a warrant comes are worse' b'than the consequences of a secret backup.' b'' b"an audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be" b'erased by the humans involved, is also necessary.' b'--' b'brad templeton, clarinet communications corp. sunnyvale, ca
