b'' b' and key size is one of the things that can be' b' verified externally.' b'' b' gee. say they feed the 80-bit key through snefru-8 and take the first b' bits of the result, then use those bits as the real key. how do you' b" figure out that each key is one of ``equal'' keys? you can try a" b' birthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then' b' you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics.' b'' b"you're right, and i retract the suggestion. still, i wonder. that" b'there are only bits of key information should, in principle, be' b'detectable. maybe some variant of the tests rivest et al. did to' b'demonstrate that des was probably not a group? it should make an' b'interesting paper a black-box analysis of a cryptosystem.'
