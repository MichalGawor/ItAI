b'' b'i see a parallel between what i will stupidly call the "homosexual"' b'issue and the "atheist" issue. please take no offense at these' b'comparisons.' b'' b'the homosexual "feels" things that i admit i do not "feel".' b'he learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings' b'and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to' b'his feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences.' b'that is, this model gives him a sense of understanding his' b'situation. models that do not match up with what he knows he' b'feels will be discarded. however, one wonders if once accepting' b'the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that' b'means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on' b'the definition he has already accepted, which of course validates' b'his model.' b'' b'if that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel.' b'' b'the christian "feels" things that an atheist claims he does not' b'feel. the christian accepts the christian theology as the true' b'description of what his feelings mean. once accepting this' b'model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model' b'which of course validates his christianity.' b'' b"as a reminder, i am a christian, a catholic, i don't hate" b'homosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understand' b'them. i only compare them because they are both so foreign' b'to me. am i as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems' b'blind to me? or am i as prejudiced against atheistic denial of' b'religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against' b'attempts by society to deny his sexuality?' b'' b'or am i just out to lunch, again?' b'' b'chris mussack'
