b'' b'this is fascinating. atheists argue for abortion, defend homosexuality' b'as a means of population control, insist that the only values are' b'biological and condemn war and capital punishment. according to' b'benedikt, if something is contardictory, it cannot exist, which in' b'this case means atheists i suppose.' b'' b'what atheists are you talking about?' b'' b'imnsho, abortion is the womans choice. homosexual sex is the choice of' b'the people involved. war is sometimes necessary.' b'' b'this leaves capital punishment. i oppose capital punishemnt because' b'mistakes can happen (yes this thread went around with no resolution' b'recently).' b'' b'as far as poplulation control, i think contraception and education are' b'the best courses of action.' b'' b'i would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an' b'excellent means of controlling population growth), or to capital' b"punishment, i'm sorry but the logic escapes me." b'' b"that's because you are again making the assumption that all atheists" b'have some specific mindset.' b'' b'and why just capital punishment, what is being questioned here, the' b'propriety of killing or of punishment? what is the basis of the' b'ecomplaint?' b'' b'mistakes can happen bill, and i could be the victim of such a mistake.' b'' b'--' b'mike mcangus the truth is still the truth' b'|' b'(some of the old .sig viruses are still the best)'
