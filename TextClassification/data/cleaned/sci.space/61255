b'' b' humans (and this was published' b' in have already withstood accelerations of 45g. all this is very' b" long-winded but here's my question finally are 45g accelerations in" b' fact humanly tolerable? with the aid of any mechanical devices of' b' course.' b'' b'are you sure 45g is the right number? as far as i know, pilots are' b'blackout in dives that exceed 8g 9g. 45g seems to be out of human' b'tolerance. would anybody clarify this please.' b'' b'actually, both numbers are correct. the difference is in the direction' b'of the acceleration. for pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to' b"the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the" b'acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance). in this' b"case, you can only put up with about g's even with a pressure suit." b'' b'the record for acceleration, though, is measured along "the direction' b'you\'re facing" (for lack of a better term). as i recall, this record' b"was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's and was about g's or so." b'' b'eric seale'
