b'' b': the median of a distribution is that variate-value which divides the' b': distribution halfway, i.e. of the distribution (population) have' b': lower and half have higher variate-values.' b'' b': so for males the median=7.3, this means that half of these men' b': are higher than this and half are lower than this. now if the population' b': sample size is and of them are gay, males are gay. if we' b': say they are distributed equally then only are greater than b': sexual partners, of course, this means that heterosexual men are' b': greater than b'' b'not quite. first, the median does not imply that half of the men are' b'above and half below it simply means that is the mid-point' b'between the maximum number of partners and the minimum (which is most' b'likely zero). however, assuming your implication to be more-or-less' b'correct, your final result is still invalid. if of *all* males' b'have had more than partners, and you deduct the assumed of' b'homosexual males, what remains is not but still of all' b"*heterosexual* males. which is to say: hey, we're all human." b'' b'-garison'
