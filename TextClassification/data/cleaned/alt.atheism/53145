b'' b'' b'well, i have typed in the oed definitions. as you will note upon reading' b'them, a punishment, being an inanimate object, is incapable of "showing' b'mercy." so, you can not say that a merciless punishment is a cruel one.' b'sorry, you must have missed the stuff in parens when you read the' b'definition (where transf. transferred sense and fig. b'figurative,-ly). "things" can be cruel. samples of text from the first' b'definition include, "because i would not see thy cruell nailes plucke' b'out his poore old eyes," and "the puniness of man in the centre of a' b'cruel and frowning universe."' b'' b"sure nails can be cruel. i'd imagine nails in your eyes would be" b'*very* painful. but, this does not imply that a painless death is' b'cruel, which is what you are supposed to be trying to show.' b'' b'keith'
