b'' b'' b'' b'how do you (mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with' b"christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither" b'marry nor be given in marriage (luke, chapt. b'' b'footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the book of tobit.' b'tobit is in the septuagint. goodspeed published it in a book called' b'"the apocrypha". most any bookstore will have this. at any rate, the jews' b"of christ's day had this book. it is a story mostly centered around the" b'son of tobit who was named tobias. there was a young lady, sarah, who had' b'entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. the brothers' b'all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage.' b'' b'tobias was entitled to have sarah for his wife because tobias was' b'her only relative and "...she was destined for [tobias] from the beginning"' b'(6:17).' b'' b'tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. the' b'seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. that does not' b'eliminate tobias, her eighth husband. tobit is a fun and interesting' b"story to read. it's kind of a mythical romance. it's a little shorter" b'than esther.' b'' b'the lds also have scriptures that parallel and amplify luke most' b'notably doctrines and covenants b'' b'"therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry' b'her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as' b'he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage' b'are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of' b'the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they' b'are out of the world.' b'' b'"therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor' b'are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which' b'angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are' b'worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of' b'glory."' b'' b'' b'cordially,' b'charles dike'
