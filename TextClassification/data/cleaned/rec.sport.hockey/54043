b'' b'' b": that's not inner calm. it's boredom, and it's being spoiled. the arena's" b': been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just' b": take winning for granted. it's been seemingly forever since the team" b": lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and" b': surprise at victory.' b'' b'at least last night there was some excitement. the pens' b"didn't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like" b"the previous two games. i'm not sure if nj just rose up and" b'played better or if the penguins just started to play down' b'somewhat. probably it was somewhere in between. new jersey' b'seemed much more aggressive last night in the pens end. they' b'did much more swarming around, which at least kept an' b'element of suspense in the game. no question that billington' b"helped make it more interesting also. claude lemieux didn't" b'help the cause any though, with his ejection early in the' b"game. so, who's going to start in the devils goal for the" b'"final" game sunday? sorry. i couldn\'t help myself.' b'' b'--' b'_____________________________________________________________________________' b'tom huot' b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'
