b'' b'#' b'# i am not aware of any such incidents.' b'# b'# b"# i've read most of the history books dealing with this period," b'# good and bad, and while it is possible that i missed one or two,' b"# none of those i've read documents any razing of mosques. so i" b'# think that this remarkable claim requires specific documentation.' b'# b'# for the forgetful newcomers, here are the references.' b'# b'# the reference i based my posting on originally is the book "the west' b'# bank story", by rafik halabi (new york: harcourt brace jovanovich' b'# original title: die westbank story).' b'# b'# quoting from the west bank story, pages b'# "on the night of june an israeli officer marched from door to door' b'# through the moghrabi quarter [of east jerusalem] giving the residents' b"# three hours' notice to evacuate their homes." b'# b'# [the participants in a' b'# july meeting of a group of arab relgious and political' b'# figures] protested the immodest dress of israelis visiting the mosques' b'# and the destruction of two mosques in the moghrabi quarter adjacent to' b'# the western wall."' b'#' b'# this issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of' b"# just one reference probably won't resolve this issue to those that" b'# oppose your insistence that mosques *were* destroyed. even in your' b'# location of this one reference, you spend most of your quote dealing' b'# with an incidence that, while abhorrant, has nothing to do with the' b'# issue at hand here. then, at the end of the quote, there is an almost' b'# off-hand comment that "two mosques" were destroyed.' b'' b"tim, you're missing the big sleight-of-hand here. i can accept every" b'word quoted from halabi and still have zero evidence of any mosques' b'being razed. note that what halabi refers to is not that mosques' b'were razed but that people protested alleged razing. too well we' b'know that this is a common demagogic tactic (or has anyone forgotten' b'the temple mount riots, when the moslem crowd was led to believe' b'that the israeli guards were there to cover for the tmf instead of' b'stop them?)' b'' b'--- d. c. sessions speaking for myself b'--- author (and everything else!) of tmail (dos mail/news shell)
