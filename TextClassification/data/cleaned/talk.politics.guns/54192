b'' b"say you're in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody. you" b'give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in their' b'action anyway and you end up shooting and killing them. my question is' b'what do you do? should you stay and wait for the cops or should you' b"collect your brass (if you're using a semi-auto) and get out of there" b"(provided of course you don't think that you have been seen)?" b'' b'for me, it would be an obvious choice: armed self-defence is clearly' b'and strongly protected by the colorado constitution and the laws' b'of the state. in the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,' b"i wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless i had been" b"publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something i'm not in" b"the habit of doing... even then, the worst i'd have to deal with" b'was a class misdemeanor.) even if the situation were not so' b'clear, and i might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or' b'homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. if' b"i were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, i'd be committing" b'several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence' b'in court ("if it really was self-defence," the prosecuter would' b'ask, "why did you run away and hide from the police?")' b'' b'in other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:' b'if someone in, say, washington d.c. were to use a gun in self-defence' b'he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of' b"that city's gun control laws. such a person's choices would be" b'between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible' b'conviction for half a dozen.' b'' b'frank crary' b'cu boulder' b''
