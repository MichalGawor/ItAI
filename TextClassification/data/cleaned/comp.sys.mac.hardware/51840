b'' b'' b'a question in general about displaying ntsc through a mac.' b'' b'if i understand correctly, the video spigot can display ntsc' b'in a small window as well as capture the data in quicktime' b'format.' b'' b'however, if i want to use a larger window, what are my options?' b'perhaps i misunderstood the video spigot review...' b'' b'also, i am not interested in quicktime. i would merely like to' b'use my mac as a television from time to time. i have a nice' b'sony monitor, and i would like to use it as a second tv' b'when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular tv.' b'' b'perhaps some of the video cards for the mac accept ntsc input?' b'i have a iisi, and i am willing to buy a nubus adapter.' b'' b'thanks in advance for any help,' b'' b'george micahels'
