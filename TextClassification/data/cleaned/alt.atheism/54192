b'' b'[interchange on hoban deleted]' b'' b'this post of mine also illustrates that i am not simply a reactionary' b"who hates any book which doesn't go out of its way to avoid upsetting" b'religionists.' b'' b"only those you haven't actually read? sorry, but the irony remains." b'' b"i reiterate for the nth time also that i don't agree with k's fatwa," b'nor do i support censorship. my point in the original thread has been' b'to show why rushdie is not particularly due sympathy by those who hold' b"their religion in high esteem and don't enjoy seeing things which slander" b"it (like the story of the satanic verses (as opposed to the rushdie's" b'_tsv_)) played with for amusement.' b'' b"so although you don't agree with the fatwa, and apparently don't think" b'rushdie should be killed for his book, yet you think he is not due' b'sympathy for being being under this threat. furthermore you base this' b'reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular' b'well-known story which if true might reflect poorly on the' b'absolute truth of your religion. yet, this opinion is formed without' b'recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context,' b'accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this' b"book contains and what the author's motivations are. and then you" b'come forward and recommend another book which touches on (presumably' b'"plays with") religious/historical material because you find its' b'overall presentation neutral!' b'--' b'these are my opinions. for a nominal fee, they can be yours.'
