b'' b'as an animal science student, i know that a number of animals transfer' b'immunoglobin to thier young through thier milk. in fact, a calf _must_' b'have a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within hours to' b'effectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than)' b'24 hours the intestines are "open" to the ig passage. my question is,' b'does this apply to human infants to any degree?' b'' b'thanks for your time responding,' b'matthew keeler'
