b'' b'janet reno killed the waco children. she is responsible for' b'their deaths. she should resign immediately. she should have' b'understood that david koresh was a madman who would do anything' b'against the children if he became provoked. all the warning' b'signs were there and she ignored them. she provoked koresh' b'into killing the children.' b'' b'aside from the fact that i disagree w/ you, she did offer to resign and the' b'president rejected the offer. she was willing to take responsibility, and' b'the president has the balls enough to stand by a decision.' b'' b"the fact that reno is actually taking responsibility (gee--that's a new" b"one for a politician) is a new thing for a member of clinton's administration." b"i actually respect her for having a backbone i never thought i'd say" b'that about someone from that bunch).' b'' b'the way i understand what happened is that she discussed with clinton' b"what was being planned for waco. clinton didn't say no, so gave de" b'facto approval for the operation. things got messed up, and a lot of' b'people died horrible deaths.
