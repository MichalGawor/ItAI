b'' b"we were talking about migraine and exercise (i'm the one who can't" b'fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...). anyway, turning' b'the thread around, the other day i played tennis during my lunch' b"hour. i'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise. i" b'got overheated, and dehydrated. afterwards, i noticed a tingling' b'sensation all over my head then about hours later, i could feel' b'a migraine start. (i continued to drink water in the afternoon.)' b"i took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started although" b"it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the" b'pain subsided.' b'' b"this isn't the first time that i've had a migraine occur after exercise." b"i'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and i wonder" b'what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?).' b"i'm not giving up tennis so is there anything i can do (besides get into" b"shape and don't play at high noon) to prevent this?" b'' b'thanks,' b'--' b'**********************************************************************' b'janet jakstys uucp:{ames,mcdcup}!ntmtv!janet' b'mtn. view, ca.' b'**********************************************************************'
