b'' b'' b'on the subject of cs/cn/tear gas: when i received my initial introduction to' b'tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit. if' b'there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or' b'any other obstacles to movement, i would have had a difficult time exiting' b'' b"you couldn't find a window after six hours?" b'' b"i'd bet cash of the people couldn't find the window after six" b"minutes! ask anybody who's taken basic training in the military. it is" b'not at all uncommon for a few soldiers who have not properly attached' b'and cleared their masks to require assistance exiting the chamber. since' b"that chamber has a door, not just a window, it's likely a hell of a lot" b'easier to exit than a multi-room, damaged house.' b'' b"< isu only censors what i read, not what i say. don't blame them. b'< usenet: post to exotic, distant machines. meet exciting, b'< unusual people. and flame them. b''
