b'' b'you are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop! what if you are on an' b'xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine? that is when the' b'load problems occur. if you had a machine with xterminals attached and' b"they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable" b'ethernet bandwidth waste.' b'' b'ethernet certainly has enough bandwidth for a few blinking cursors. my' b'lisp machine blinks the cursor twice a second and updates the time in the' b'status line every second. this uses under 1k bytes/second, or about of' b'the bandwidth of ethernet. a hundred of them on a single ethernet might be' b'a problem, but a couple dozen should be fine.' b'' b'bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network.' b'one of major flaws of x is the horrendous number of transactions (and' b'hence process switches) that it forces upon a host. actual measurements' b'(hourly average) are per second per logged in user, which can lead to' b'20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is' b'filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how' b'many processes are needed for each character.)' b'' b'while a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking' b'process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like' b'10 process switches per second per user. this is a significant increase' b'in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working' b'set. if you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many' b'as b'' b"if you want to go there, i wouldn't start from here!" b'' b'' b'nick maclaren' b'university of cambridge computer laboratory,' b'new museums site, pembroke street,' b'cambridge cb2 3qg, england.' b'tel.: b'fax:
