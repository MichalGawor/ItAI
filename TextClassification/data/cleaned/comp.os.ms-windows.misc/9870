b'' b'' b': the key issue that i bought my bj-200 on was ink drying speed. you really' b': have to try awful hard to get the bj-200 ink to smear. the hp deskjets need' b': seconds to completely dry. in both cases, however, do not get your' b': pages wet. unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is ink, not' b': toner. but that should go without saying.' b'' b'i think the ink now used in the deskjet family is water-fast.'
