b'' b'' b' i understand that if i have a correct adapter then i can' b'use a vga monitor with my iisi.' b' are those adapters working with specific brands?' b' is adapter for nec or sony working with other brands?' b' i will be using a vga monitor with iisi for a month soon.' b" i don't have any clue what monitor will be." b'' b"here's the story:" b'' b'(1) the iisi *cannot* supply a vga output. however...' b'' b'(2) some vga-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal' b'the mac uses to drive the apple or inch "high resolution color' b'display"---i.e., apple\'s own 640x480 mode.' b'' b'so, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your iisi, you' b'need (a) an adapter that converts from the mac db-15 connector to the' b'vga-style high density db-15 connector, *but* tells the mac to use' b"it's own 640x480 mode, not the vga 640x480 mode, and (b) a vga monitor" b'that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the mac 640x480 mode over' b'the vga 640x480 mode (which as i stated in above, the iisi cannot' b'produce).' b'' b'as far as (a) above is concerned, contact' b'' b'james engineering, inc.' b'6329 fairmount ave.' b'el cerrito, ca b'510-525-7350' b'fax: b'' b'they can probably get you the right adapter. remember: you do *not*' b'want the run-of-the-mill mac-to-vga adapter, because it will try to' b'have your iisi produce the vga mode, which it cannot (the computer' b'will just fail to produce any video signal at all). instead, you want' b'an adapter that connects between the mac-style and vga-style' b'connectors, but tells the mac to use the apple 640x480 mode. sorry' b'for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.' b'' b'as far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal' b'with a horizontal bandwidth of khz and a vertical retrace rate of' b"67 hz. these are the spec's of apple's 640x480 mode. for comparison," b'the vga-standard 640x480 mode uses a khz horizontal bandwidth and' b'a hz. vertical retrace rate.' b'' b"the monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as" b"the apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes" b'in the pc compatible world.' b'' b'good luck!' b'' b'-fred martin' b'' b'' b'--' b'epistemology and learning group, mit media lab cambridge, ma usa'
