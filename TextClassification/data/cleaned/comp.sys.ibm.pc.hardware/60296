b'' b'hi. recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about' b'3 minutes to warm up.' b'' b'previously, when i first start up my pc i can see all the' b"cmos messages (ram test ...etc) but now i've got to wait" b'for about 3min before the display shows anything and' b'it starts up with a bright white flash. this only happens' b'when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).' b'if it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on' b'again, the display works as normal like before.' b'' b'does anyone know what is causing this? is it a warning that' b'it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a' b"386sx and its about yrs old). i've used systems at work for" b'years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.' b'' b"i'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer." b'thanks a lot.' b'' b'edwin' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------' b'* e&e engineering, university of auckland b'* private bag auckland, new zealand
