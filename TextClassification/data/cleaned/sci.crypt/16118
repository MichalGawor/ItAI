b'' b' encryption technologies are currently reguarded as arms by the' b' feds, hence the export ban. while the second is under enough' b' attack for guarrentteing our rights to fire arms, perhaps we' b' should reflect on this as well. (perhaps fire arms are not the' b' only weapons covered under the second amendment)' b'' b"hmmm... i wouldn't consider encryption to be a weapon. how would the" b'government classify encryption? seems to me that encryption ought to' b'be covered by the first amendment. using this line of reasoning, the' b"government shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and" b'what encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting' b"one's freedom of speech. in other words, encrypted data---text," b'graphics, or other information---is just another form of free speech.' b"for this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the use" b'of encryption algorithms and encrypted data. the only time the' b"government should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her" b'encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data' b"in question may be something that isn't protected by the first" b'amendment such as kiddy porn. even in a case like this the' b'government should be required to get a search warrant before coercing' b'someone into revealing the keys.' b'' b'btw, what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-art' b'nowdays. have the feds relaxed export restrictions on des yet?' b'also, is des still regarded as a good form of encryption?' b'' b' robert johnston' b'' b'' b'scott kennedy, brewer and patriot' b'' b'before: "david koresh is a cheap thug who interprets' b'the bible through the barrel of a gun..." --atf spokesman' b'after: "[the atf] is a cheap thug who interprets' b'[the constitution] through the barrel of a gun..." --me' b'' b'*******************************************' b'* batf cigarette cops b"* fbi fuehrer's bureau of incineration b'*******************************************' b'' b''
