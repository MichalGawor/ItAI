b'' b'' b'dear folks,' b'' b'i am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.' b'' b'it is a fact that the inhabitants of gaza are not entitled to a normal' b'civlized life. they habe been kept under occupation by israel since b'without civil and political rights.' b'' b'it is a fact that gazans live in their own country, palestine. gaza is' b'not a foriegn country. nor is telaviv, jaffa, askalon, beersheba foreign' b'country for gazans. all these places are occupied as far as palestinians' b'are concerned and as far as common sense has it.' b'' b'it is a fact that zionists deny gazans equal rights as israeli citizens' b'and the right to determine by themsevles their government. when zionists' b'will begin to consider gazans as human beings who deserve the same' b'rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. not before.' b'' b"somebody mentioned that gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore israel" b'is entitled to close its borders to gaza. in this case, gaza should be' b'entitled to reciprocate, and deny israeli civilians and military personnel' b'to enter the area. as the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master' b"and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading." b'' b'to close off people in the strip, deny them means of subsistence' b'and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a' b'crime. it is neither justifiable nor legal. it just reflects the abyss' b'to which israeli society has degraded.' b'' b'i would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain' b'why israel denies gazans who were born and brought up in jaffa to return' b'and live there would they be allowed to, if they converted to judaism b'is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their' b'religion or ethnic origin please give an honest answer.' b'' b'elias' b''
