b'' b'see subject. an opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?).' b'' b'i am looking for a commercial/pd graphics editor with fairly limited' b'abilities that runs under x and preferably uses motif widgets. it must' b'run on hp-ux version either with or without the pex extension. the' b'sort of things i want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects' b'such as lines, rectangles and text. bounding rectangle operations are' b'sufficient for object selection. ideally it should also allow the' b'creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g.' b'text entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory.' b'' b'does anyone have such an animal? if you do, please mail me with details' b'including price (especially run-time licensing since it must be' b'included in a product). alternatively, send glossies to me at logica,' b'68 newman street, london w1, including technical info please. for pd' b'stuff, i have some effort that could be put into porting.' b'' b'thanks for any help,' b'nicholas young.' b'--' b'nicholas young
