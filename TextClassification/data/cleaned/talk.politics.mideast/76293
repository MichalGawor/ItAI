b'' b'' b'' b'a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle-east.' b'---------------------------------------------------------- by' b'\t\t\t elias davidsson' b'having stated my assumptions, i will now state my proposal.' b'' b'1. a fund should be established which would disburse grants' b'for each child born to a couple where one partner is israeli-jew' b'and the other palestinian-arab.' b'...' b"5. the emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'" b'marriages in israel/palestine, all of whom would have relatives on' b"'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its" b'ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a' b"truly civil society. the existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of" b'people would also help the integration of israeli society into the' b'' b' sounds just like a racial theory that hitler outlined in mein kampf.' b'' b'someone else said something similar. i will not comment on the' b'value or lack of value of elias\'s "proposal". i just want to say' b'that it is very distressing that at least two people here are' b'profoundly ignorant of nazi racial doctrine. they were not' b"like elias's idea, they were more like the opposite." b'' b'nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation. an' b'instructive example is the nazi attitude to gypsies. according to' b'nazi theoreticians, gypsies were an aryan race. they were persecuted,' b'and in huge numbers murdered, because most european gypies were' b'considered not pure gypsies but "mongrels" formed from the pure gypsy' b'race and other undesirable races. this was the key difference between' b'the theoretical approach to jews and gypsies, by the way. it is also' b'true that towards the end of wwii even the "purist" gypsies were' b'hunted down as the theory was forgotten.' b'' b'brendan.'
