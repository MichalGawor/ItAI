b'' b'' b'before you go in. find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable' b'profit for the dealer offer them that price and stick to' b'it.' b'' b'whoa! watch your terminology. "dealer invoice" is *not* "dealer cost".' b'you\'ll hear lots of ads screaming "two dollars over dealer invoice!!!"' b'sounds like a real deal, huh? no. you know what the "dealer invoice"' b"(also called factory invoice) is? it's a piece of paper with numbers" b'on it that the factory sends the dealer. what do the numbers' b"signify? absolutely nothing. it's a marketing gimmick that the" b'salesman can wave in your face to impress you. note that nowhere' b'on the "invoice" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and' b'most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast,' b'low voice saying something like "invoice may not reflect actual' b'dealer cost". actually, i *guarantee* it does not reflect actual' b'dealer cost.' b'' b'also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent.' b'adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that' b'you want. haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of' b'"dealer prep" and "protection package" (i.e. a few squirts of' b"paint and fabric protectant). while you're at it, ask the salesman" b"to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash. my" b'wife and i got a joyride in a twin-turbo mitsubishi 3000gt when' b'we bought our mitsubishi mini-van.'
