b'' b'' b'' b'yes, i know computers and harddisk drives should be always on. but what' b"about monitors? they generate a lots of heat. should i or shouldn't i" b'keep them on hours a day? any advice?' b'' b'well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your' b'electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially' b'if you have a large or greater) color monitor. generally what i do' b'is leave my mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or' b'syetem crash, but i turn my monitor off each night before i leave my' b'office. i also turn off after dark when i do this, since there is no' b'reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being' b"displyed on the monitor's tube." b'' b'actually, i thought macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day.' b'' b'really? what makes you think this? the q700 file server in my office' b"has been on for the last months, straight, and it hasn't had any" b'problems. (note: i also keep the monitor for the file server turned off' b"when i'm not actually working on the server itself.)" b'' b'-hades'
