b'' b'' b' that argument would be more compelling if it were not for the' b'ishtar eggs and ishtar bunnies. why mix pagan fertility symbols from the' b'worship of the pagan goddess of fertility with biblical belief? what' b'would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word "easter" and' b'replace all such occurances with "resurrection sunday"? would you not' b'show up for services if they were called "resurrection sunday services"' b'rather than "easter services"?' b'' b'there is another way to view this. the true celebration is easter,' b'the resurrection of our lord. this has been true from the foundation' b'of the world. pagan practices are then either:' b'' b'1. foreshadowings of the true celebration of the resurrection,' b'in which dim light was shone forth so that people would' b'recognize the full truth when it was manifested, or' b'' b'2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not' b'recognize the truth when it was manifested.' b'' b"i don't believe the second argument, because i believe in the power" b'of the resurrection, the fulfillment of the incarnation, and our hope.' b'earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of' b'the truth of the resurrection. as paul states, we see through a glass' b'darkly. so do others. it serves no purpose arguing about who has' b'the darker or lighter glass. the foreshadowings are not perfect.' b'so what? our understnding of god is today imperfect, for we are not' b"yet perfected. theosis is not a gift such that wham, we're perfect." b'' b'--' b'-------' b'lawrence overacker' b'shell oil company, information center houston, tx
