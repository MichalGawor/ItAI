b'' b'' b'hey now. first of all, sorry to post this dos question in a windows' b"group, but i'm in kinda a hurry, so i can't scramble to find the dos" b"groups' names." b'' b'anyway, anyone know where i ccan find the exit codes to dos commands?' b'' b'there are alternatives:' b'1. you can try to write a small c program something like:' b'' b'int my_int_var;' b'my_int_var system("command");' b'' b'and display my_int_var value (which is the exit code of the command).' b'' b'2. or use 4dos.com instead of command.com (it has built in move command)' b'you can also get any program exist code by using the exec function' b'of 4dos:' b'' b'' b'will display the exit code of the command.' b'' b'3. get dos not worth buying if you already have qemm/pctools/norton,' b'and you only need the move utility.' b'' b"the manual doesn't seem to have all of them. i'm particularly looking" b'for copy, in order to make a "move" batch file, such that if the file' b"wasn't coppied properly, it won't be deleted." b'' b'' b'thanks, i.a,' b'mickey' b'--' b'ace|| ...!uunet!seas.gwu.edu!louray' b'|||| *how do make a ms-windows .grp file reflect a hd directory??*' b'\\\\\\\\ "well i ain\'t always right, but i\'ve never been wrong.."(gd)' b'' b'' b'+---------------------------------------------------+' b'| agus budy wuysang b'| digitech student b'| monash university (clayton) b'| melbourne, australia b'+---------------------------------------------------+'
