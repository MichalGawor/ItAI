b'' b'' b'jutila was a failure, i think, while makela (and ari haanpaa) had an' b'on-again/off-again career with the islanders. both players had to play in the' b'minors. of course i "like" our players, i just don\'t think the names' b'you mention could cut it as stars in the nhl! even "rexi" in his prime was more' b'of a good regular in new york/edmonton than a superstar in his own right,' b'although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf.' b'' b'' b"ruotsaleinen was a more than competent nhl'er...his choice of where" b'to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability.' b'' b'he was crucial to the oilers stanley cup victory in the one' b'without gretzky, because he made an oiler power play which was' b'lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive. the' b'oilers missed him more the following year than kurri, and i think' b'the oilers would have make the finals if ruotsaleinen has stayed' b'around the following season, and would have beaten pittsburgh' b"with ruotsaleinen and a healthy messier...and delayed pittsburgh's" b'dynasty by a season.' b'' b'gerald'
