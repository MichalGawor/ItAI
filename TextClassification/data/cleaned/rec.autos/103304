b'' b"i'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car. before" b'i delve into its innards, i thought i\'d check "net.wisdom" on the' b'subject. b'' b"it's a buick skyhawk (i know...i know)" b'2.0l efi 4-banger' b'auto' b'35k miles' b'' b'when i drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at' b'highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of' b'getting "stuck" in 3rd gear. as a result, when you stop for' b'a light the motor stalls. putting the car in park, and waiting' b'for seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission' b'to "reset" and go back into 1st. otherwise, it just stalls when' b'put in drive.' b'' b'my thoughts: either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting' b'stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up' b'converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely). the least' b'likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum' b'hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of' b'vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).' b'' b'my background is that my father owns a service station and' b'i worked there on and off from years of age. please' b'feel free to be as technical as you want. b'' b"i'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free" b'beer. <grin' b'' b'skoal,' b'' b'chris'
