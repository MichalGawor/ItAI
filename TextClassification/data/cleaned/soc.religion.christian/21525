(rheims-douay translation)' b'' b'i cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies' b'anything as strong as andrew suggests, nor does the ephesians' b'passage suggest that the verb means "to preserve from any taint of' b'original or actual sin from the first moment of existence." i should' b'like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb, preferably not' b'from s writer who is discussing luke at the moment.' b'' b'yours,' b'james kiefer'
