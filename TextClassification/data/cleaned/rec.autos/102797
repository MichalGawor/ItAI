b'' b'i have a acura integra speed with miles on it. it is positively' b'the worst car i have ever owned. i had an prelude that had 160k miles on' b'it when i sold it, and it was still going strong this is with religious' b'attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. both cars were driven in' b'exactly the same manner..' b'' b'1. it has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)' b'2. sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)' b'3. all struts started leaking about 25-30k miles' b'4. windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)' b'5. seek stop working on radio about 20k miles' b'6. two timing belts.' b'7. constant error signals from computer.' b'' b'8. and finally. a rod bearing went out on the no. piston seriously damaging' b'the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. when the overhaul was done' b'last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because' b'the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. the camshaft took b'weeks to get because it is on national back order.' b'' b'everything on the engine is unique to the year. they went to a new' b'design in parts are very expensive.' b'' b'no way would i ever buy another acura. it is highly overrated. b'' b''
