b'' b'' b' the concept of tongues as used at pentecost seems an outdated concept' b' now. with the bible available in nearly every language, and missionaries' b' who are out there in all languages, why does the church need tongues?' b'' b'i guess there are at least some people who are not able to support' b'this claim. there are still a lot of languages without the bible, or a' b'part of the bible. there are still many languages which we are not' b'able to write, simply because the written version of the language has' b'not yet been defined!' b'' b"yes, i suppose that's true. of course, notice i qualified with nearly" b'every language and there are missionaries out there who can' b'speak every imaginable language and dialect. but then, the fact that' b'not all languages have a written gospel lends no credence to the' b'concept of "pentecost" type xenoglossolalia since most tongues occur not' b'in these places of un-written language, but rather in churches full' b'of people who do have a written language and a bible in that language.' b'' b'but i nitpick.'
