b'' b'' b' i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most' b' eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa' b' counterparts. for instance, the eisa orchid pro designer iis-e is' b' only about as "fast" as the isa diamond speedstar plus, which isn\'t' b' what i would call "fast."' b'' b" i don't understand why eisa video cards aren't, as a group, on the" b' same level of performance as local bus cards, given that eisa video' b" cards have a bit bus to move data around, instead of isa's bits." b'' b'good question.' b"answer: the eisa bus does move bits rather than isa's b' but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus.' b" i think that's either or mhz." b' the local bus designs also move bits like the eisa, but' b' they move the data at the cpu speed, up to mhz.' b' so, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at' b' mhz, and the eisa is moving 32bit data at or mhz.' b' so the local bus should be to times faster than eisa on' b' a mhz cpu. eisa should be about two (maybe times as' b' fast as isa.' b'' b'i would expect the eisa board to be more than twice as fast as the isa' b'board. not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at' b'least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for' b'bus transactions between the two busses. most isa boards require' b'multiple clocks per bus transaction typically this is around b"eisa boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a rate, so i" b'would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an isa card.' b'' b'so i guess, for me, the question is unanswered still. i would expect' b'him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does' b'not.' b'' b'--' b'"insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live' b'in the real world." mary shafer, nasa ames dryden' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
