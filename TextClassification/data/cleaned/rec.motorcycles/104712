b'' b'' b'basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and' b'neck-rein. plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and' b'you pull in the direction you wish to go. neck-reining steers a horse' b'by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the' b"horse's neck in the direction you wish to go. when training a" b'plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins' b'under his necks. thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein' b'pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit' b'(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).' b'' b'i learned when riding bareback as a kid to "palm-reign", by just' b"pushing on the right side of the horse's neck with your right palm to turn" b'left a lot like countersteering. so that came pretty easy to me in the' b'transition to motorcycles. it took a while however to break my habit of' b'kicking the rear fender with my heels to go faster.' b'' b'steve' b'__________________________________________________________________________' b'microbiology sc-42 phone: b'university of washington fax: b'seattle, wa
