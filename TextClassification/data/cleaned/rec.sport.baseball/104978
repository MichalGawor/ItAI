b'' b'[stuff deleted]' b"mattingly scores badly on both counts. he doesn't get to very many" b'balls, and he lets a lot of balls go through. the fact that he "looks' b'smooth", "has great hands", and makes few errors means nothing. this is' b'traditional brainless reliance on observations that can easily be' b'misled. like a lot of bad fielders, mattingly actually makes himself' b"look better by not having any range. he's nowhere near as bad as steve" b"garvey, but that's not much of a compliment." b'' b'i agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific' b'argument. that "has great hands" means nothing. it seems to me that' b"a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily)" b'from his ability to field grounders or catch popups. how many such' b'chances does he get during a game? many fewer than he gets chances' b'to catch throws from 2b,ss,3b and p (i mean the total of these is' b'much higher than grounder/popup totals). this implies to me that there' b'is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line' b'or in the dirt. "good hands" are needed for such plays, and thus have' b"value. i don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences" b"of these plays, but i'd guess that the values of these abilities are" b"similar. it's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily" b'on how they field bunts and popups. (but not as marked i suppose).' b'' b'michael' b'' b'' b''
