b'' b'|' b'| many of the atheists posting here argue against their own parody of' b'| religion; they create some ridiculous caricature of a religion and' b'| then attack the believers within that religion and the religion itself' b'| as ridiculous. by their own devices, they establish a new religion, a' b'| mythology.' b'' b'you mean bobby mozumder is a myth? we wondered about that.' b'' b'| the point of course, is to erect an easy target and deflect the' b'| disputants away from the real issue atheism. the fictional christian' b'| or moslem or jew who is supposed to believe the distorted' b'| representation of their beliefs presented here, is therefore made to' b'| seem a fool and his/her arguments can thereby be made to appear' b'| ludicrous. the mythology is the misrepresentations of religion used' b'| here as fact.' b'' b"you mean bobby mozumder didn't really post here? we wondered" b'about that, too.' b'' b'so, mr conner. is bobby mozumder a myth, a performing artist,' b'a real moslem. a crackpot, a provocateur? you know everything' b"and read all minds: why don't you tell us?" b'' b'jon.'
