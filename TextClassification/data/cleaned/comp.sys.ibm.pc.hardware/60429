b'' b'' b'' b' but i still want to know why it intrinsically better' b" (than ide, on an isa bus) when it comes to multi-tasking os's when" b' managing data from a single scsi hard drive.' b' b' a scsi controller that transfers data by dma allows the cpu to request data' b' from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data' b' and moves it to memory.' b'' b' ide also uses dma techniques. i believe floppy controller also uses dma,' b' and most a/d boards also use dma. dma is no big deal, and has nothing to' b' do directly with scsi.' b'' b"ide does not do dma. this is because it's like te pc at hard disk" b'interface. the controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the' b'controller card, then the cpu moves the data from the buffer to main' b"memory where it's needed. if ide doesn't work this way, then it's not" b'compatible.' b'' b"heck, if ide used dma, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about" b'isa bus systems with more than 16m ram not working with their ide' b'drives. 16m is the dma addressing limit of the isa bus, and if ide' b'did dma there would be trouble.' b'' b'(btw, there are dma-enabling signals in the ide cable spec, but the' b'last report i heard was that they are never implemented, because it' b'would require a different kind of ide adapter and different drivers.)' b'--' b'os/2 will do for me until amigados for the comes along...'
