b'' b'one thing to consider is time division multiplexing the emg' b'channels to reduce the number of rf carriers you have to generate.' b'if you multiplexed the emg inputs at 10khz, that would probably be' b"sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have hz per" b'channel sampling rate.) that level of analog multiplexing should' b'be rather easy to accomplish.' b'' b'combining a lot of rf carriers is pretty tricky to do without' b'generating intermodulation. a system to be carried by a runner is' b'in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to' b'keep balanced.' b'' b'a commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with' b'a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.' b'obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws' b'govern the use of transeivers in your location.' b'' b'' b'--' b'bill mayhew neoucom computer services department' b'rootstown, oh usa phone:
