b'' b"while we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget shea, which" b'was designed to accommodate both the mets jets. it was the first' b'stadium (i think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be' b'oriented at right angles for baseball in parallel for football.' b'' b'minor point: shea stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but' b'not with the jets in mind as the tennant. the new york football giants' b'had moved to yankee stadium (from the polo grounds) in and was' b'having problem with stadium management (the city did not own yankee' b'stadium until the idea was to get the giants to move into shea.' b'when a deal was worked out between the giants and the yankees the' b'new afl franchise, the new york titans, approached the city about using' b'the new stadium. the titans were playing in downing stadium (where the' b'cosmos played soccer in the 70s). because shea stadium was tied into' b"the world's fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to" b"promote the new franchise and the world's fair (like they were doing" b'with the mets). so the deal was worked out.' b'' b'of course, with the jets gone to jersey (and a truly good football' b'stadium), the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where,' b"because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the" b'action. the mets announcers--kiner murphy in particular--have' b'always hyped it as "beautiful shea' b'stadium," a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.' b'' b"i'm under the impression that when murph says it, he means it! as a" b"regular goer to shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and" b'renovated the place. remember, this is its 30th year!' b'--' b'scott barman mets mailing list (feed the following into your shell):' b'| subscribe' b"let's go mets!
