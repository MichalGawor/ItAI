b'' b'' b'' b'$ the biggest hurdle for automatics (imho) is not shifting speed' b"$ per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you" b'$ try to force it to shift manually.' b'$ b'' b'i rented an oldsmobile achieva (is that a yuppie name or what?) and a' b"nissan stanza. they both had automatics. i'm a manual transmission" b'bigot but i have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were' b'better shifters than i am. and yes, they responded very quickly to' b'kickdown requests. the nissan had a tachometer so i was able to figure' b"out which gear i was in. (the olds may have also, but i don't" b'remember.) i believe it shifted all the way down to second at about b'mph when my foot told it, "no i really want to accelerate quickly."' b'' b"i would still prefer a manual, but i won't delude myself into thinking" b"that i can out-accelerate a modern automatic. and i'm very smooth at" b'shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic.' b'--' b'tommy reingold' b'at&t bell labs, holmdel, nj'
