b'' b'greetings!' b'' b"i've had a bunch of problems with the 24x. opening a dos window on the" b'desktop can occasionally result in the windows "blowing up" into a set of' b'horizontal lines, hashing the entire desktop. nothing can recover this' b'except to completely exit from windows. the other irritating problem is' b'that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually' b'scrolling, as if a cr was printed without an lf. this seems only to happen' b"to communications programs, but i can't nail it down any further than that." b"note, though, that the comms programs don't have to be communicating. even" b'just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in' b'these programs causes the problem.' b'' b'prior to the latest rev of word perfect for windows, wpwin would sometimes' b'blow up, and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of' b"the problem. i've still seen this, but only once or twice with wpwin b'' b'dave zimmerman' b'(my opinions are my own)' b''
