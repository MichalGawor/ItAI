b'' b" this has me thinking. is there a biological reason why women can't put" b' their keys in their pants pockets like men do? i have two pockets on the' b' back of each of my pants. i put my keys in one and wallent in another.' b' many of the pockets even have a botton on them so i can close them securely.' b" everything is that much simpler for me. why can't women do the same?" b' is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and' b' a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?' b'' b'oh pulleeze!' b'' b"it's not biology at all, it's clothing design. women's clothing is" b"generally designed to be as non-functional as possible. it's only been" b"in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with" b'pockets deep enough to carry anything in. previously, deep pockets were' b"virtually unknown in women's clothing. skirts generally have better" b'pockets now, too. dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty' b"hopeless. i often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're" b"dressed up to go out somewhere, so i don't have to be encumbered by a" b'purse.' b'' b'if women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the' b"manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, i think" b"manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures. there's" b"an interesting chapter in susan faludi's backlash that described" b'what happened the last time clothing manufacturers ignored the' b"need for functional women's clothing. the manufactuing industry" b'lost millions.' b'' b"from a woman who would rather buy men's clothing with decent pockets and" b"long legs and high waists than women's clothing without...." b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'** claiming that sex education leads to irresponsible sex is like b'***** claiming that driver education leads to car accidents.
