b'' b'what is the expected run time a factor of on a 486dx/50' b'using the best known algorithm for finding the shortest path' b'solution for rubicks cube from a randomly chosen position?' b'' b'i have read the faq and followed the recent discussion on rubicks' b"cube but i don't believe this question has been answered. notice" b'that i am specifically looking for an algorithm that finds the' b'shortest path, not just any solution.' b'' b'it seems to me that the underlying assumption is that such a program' b'would need to do a brute force search though positions. that' b'seems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and i want to' b'know if someone has significantly improved on that.' b'' b'i have some ideas of my own on how to approach this problem, but' b'before i spend to much time developing them i wanted to know if' b'someone else has already done the work.' b'' b'administrivia: i have posted this to three groups and attempted' b'to set the followup to rec.puzzles which seems to me to be the' b'place to continue this discussion. i will cross post a summary' b'when and if it becomes appropriate. email replies gladly accepted.' b'' b'jimmy'
