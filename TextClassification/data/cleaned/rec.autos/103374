b'' b"does anybody have any information on the second generation broncos? (i'm" b"not talking about bronco ii's, i'm referring to the broncos that began" b'production in based on the f-150 chassis i believe)' b'' b'i need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all' b'models, how easily can that be done. also, what kind of price range' b"should i be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) i'm in college right" b"now, and would like a jeep. unfortunately, i've got a bit of a ride to" b'school, and i need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in' b'the spring/fall. i think that the bronco (with the removable fiberglass)' b'would be a better (read "bigger") choice than a cj-5 or cj-7.' b'' b'even better: anybody in the maryland/virginia area interested in selling' b'one?' b'' b'george howell' b''
