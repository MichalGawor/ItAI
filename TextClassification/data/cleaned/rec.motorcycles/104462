b'' b"so it looks like i'm going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage" b"for a few months, starting several months from now, and i'm already" b"contemplating how to do it so they're as easy to get going again as" b'possible. i have everything under control, i think, besides the' b'batteries. i know that if i buy a battery tender for each one' b'and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage,' b"they'll be fine. but i'm not sure that's necessary. i've never heard" b"anyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't" b'so great. but maybe someone can tell me.' b'' b'would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the' b'electrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the' b'container, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? then it' b'would seem that when the bikes come out of storage, i could put the' b'electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully' b"charged. what's wrong with this?" b'' b"on a related, but different note for you bay area denizens, wasn't" b'there someone who had a bunch of spare edta a few months back? who was' b'it? is there still any of it left?' b'' b'thanks for any and all help!' b'' b'-- robert'
