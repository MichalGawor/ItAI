b'' b'i have never worked with really small signals before and have a few' b'questions about low level noise. i have noticed that the waveform' b'synthesizer that i am using (analogic has some relatively large' b"common mode noise on it. i am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another" b'transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uv) several hundred' b'times. the has about mvp-p of common mode noise and this tends to' b'make my measurements hard to repeat. (the noise is not quite in sync with' b'line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64hz).' b'' b'how can i get rid of the noise? when i look at the spectrum using an' b'hp 3582a (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute i switch to' b"'isolation' on the input. i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the" b'input since it will read accurately down to dc.' b'' b'also, if i use a differential amplifier (ia) to solve the problem,' b"how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected" b'to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused' b'by different cable capacitances)? if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for' b'use with transient signals with content from 1khz to about 300khz, i would' b'appreciate it.'
