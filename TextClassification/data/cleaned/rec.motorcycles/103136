b'' b'' b" what protective gear is the most important? i've got a good helmet (shoei" b' rf200) and a good, thick jacket (leather gold) and a pair of really cheap' b' leather gloves... what should my next purchase be? better gloves, boots,' b' leather pants, what?' b'' b'if you can remember to tuck properly, the bits that are going to take most' b'punishment with the gear you have will probably be your feet, then hips and' b"knees. get boots then trousers. the gloves come last, as long as you've the" b'self control to pull your arms in when you tuck. if not, get good gloves' b'first hands are very easily wrecked if you put one down to steady your' b'fall at 70mph!! the other bits heal easier.' b'' b'once you are fully covered, you no longer tuck, just lie back and enjoy the' b'ride.' b'' b'best of all, take a mean of all the contradictory answers you get.'
