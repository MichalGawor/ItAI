b'' b' ...stuff deleted...' b'' b'i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east' b' or where-ever. but if you look in the amp and see what components' b' they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the' b' amplifiers sound so brilliant.' b'' b"good point...also, i wouldn't be surprised that the components" b'they use off-shore are of inferior quality. as long as it was' b'properly designed and robust, premium components are used, it' b"shouldn't matter where it is assembled." b'' b"i cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last not with" b' those quality components inside. sure the amp runs very fairly' b" hot but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good." b'' b"an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound." b'the amp you have probably is running class-a the whole day.' b'' b"actually, i'd be wary of excessively hot amps, 'cauz even though" b'the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive' b'heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component' b'regardless of quality. in fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is' b'because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted' b'to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs! hmmmmm....' b'' b'aaron' b'' b'.'
