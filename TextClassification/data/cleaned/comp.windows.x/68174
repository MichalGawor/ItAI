b'' b'' b'i have a problem which many of you might have run into. we use lots of' b'ascii terminals and use them to the max. meaning lots of attributes, line' b'' b'this means needing all attributes to work, including bold and line drawing.' b'the only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in' b'which one is bold and the other normal, while both have linedraw, fixed' b'spacing, and several sizes.' b'' b'the only standard fonts which work are the fonts like 9x15 and 9x15b under' b'"misc". they work great, except i need a font one size larger, 10x20. now' b'10x20 works well, but there is no bold counterpart!' b'' b'' b"you don't need a 'bold' counterpart. from `man xterm`:" b'' b' -fb font' b' this option specifies a font to be used when dis-' b' playing bold text. this font must be the same' b' height and width as the normal font. if only one' b' of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will' b' be used as the normal font and the bold font will' b' be produced by overstriking this font. the' b' default is to do overstriking of the normal font.' b'' b'i have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up' b'to not remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens' b'when bold is displayed. it would appear (at least in x11r4) than you cannot' b'display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts; a normal and a bold.' b'i wish someone would prove that incorrect.' b'--' b'/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\' b'| mark a. davis lake taylor hospital norfolk, va (804)-461-5001x431 b'\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/'
