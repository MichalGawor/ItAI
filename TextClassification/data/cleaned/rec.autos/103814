b'' b'hi there, maybe you can help me...' b'' b"i have an corolla with a speed as the subject line says. the gearbox" b"seems excessivly clunky. i used to have an corolla, and it was also" b"somewhat clunky, but it had more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as" b'bad as this car! is there fluid in the 5speed case? if there is, could it' b'just be low, or in need of a change? as i recall, only the autos have fluid.' b'or am i just mistaken? please no flames for owning an import. i also have' b"an old dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days..." b'' b'thanks,' b'derek'
