b'' b"it's called the free enterprize system. i suggests that those who wish to" b"enhance dos, do it, an sell it, or give it away. microsoft can't be" b'everything to everyone! period!' b'' b"it has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing" b'budgets that ms do. 4dos, for instance, is everything that' b'command.com should have been (but never could be under ms). those who' b'use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine. but they' b'have to rely on word of mouth for sales. it seems to have worked' b'pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually' b"likes to see a big glossy ad in pc magazine. that's okay, marketing" b"isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's" b'superior to the dos command interpreter in every way. they have a lot' b'more to be proud of than ms does. if ms really gave a damn, they' b"could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even" b'use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with' b'compatability issues and absconding with the technology.' b'' b'dos is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch' b'marketing and vendor agreements. the "mediocre" was excusable in the' b"early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years" b'to play with it.' b'' b"an interesting thought on that: most ms products that i'm aware of in" b'the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and' b'programmers through easter egg screens, including windows, or at least' b'have the names buried in the files. is there such a thing in dos b'and or are they too ashamed to have their names on it?' b'--' b"there's at least one fool in every married couple."
