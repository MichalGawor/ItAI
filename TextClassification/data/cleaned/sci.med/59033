b'' b'' b"the reason i'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to:" b'1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might' b'have recently been *e*ffected by it from being associated with' b'it or actually having this disorder and' b'2. help me find out where i can access any medical literature associated' b'with seizures over the internet.' b'' b'recently, i had a baby boy born with seizures which occured hours' b'after birth. he was immediately transferred to a major hospital in boston' b'and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.' b'this has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in' b'learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with' b'hospitals, procedures...etc.' b'' b"i don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed" b'quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight' b'as a normal baby would. he was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs' b'and that did not seem to help out. his mri, ekg, cat-scans are all normal,' b"but the eeg's show alot of seizure activity. after many metabolic tests," b'body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not' b'know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot' b'of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms this is where' b'we stand right now....' b'' b'if anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as i mentioned up above,' b'any information relating to this disorder i would sure appreciate hearing' b'from you. i am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gather' b'information about it. as i know now, these particular types of disorders' b"are still not really well understood by the medical community, and so i'm" b'going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle' b'insight. thanks.'
