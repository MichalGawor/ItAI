b'' b'' b'\tfortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not' b'fall into line with a lot others, recognized god as a being both' b'without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both' b'a masculine and feminine force.' b'' b"that is not necessarily unorthodox. when christians call god 'father'," b'we are using a metaphor. the bible in one place refers to god as being' b'like a mother. god is neither a father nor a mother in the literal' b'sense; god has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is' b'usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less' b'misleading of the two possibilities.' b'--' b':- michael a. covington, associate research scientist b':- the university of georgia phone b':- athens, georgia u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi
