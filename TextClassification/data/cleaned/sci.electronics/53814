b'' b'' b'i was looking at the amps diagram for sony receivers, and i' b'was amazed to find a difference between the us and canadian model' b'on the capacitor(s) that hangs off the output to the speakers:' b'' b' to speaker (identical both models' b'from amp b'(idnetical both models) b' b' b' b' b' b' canadian model only!' b' us model b' and world-wide b' model only. candian model only!' b' b' b' gound' b'' b'the board itself is also identical, with room for all three caps. the' b'us/can versions is clearly indicated in both places.' b'' b'how does that make sense? is essentially for caps' b'(there are just standard caps, no special w/type/precision).' b'' b'please explain this' b' michael golan' b'' b'the only explanation i can think of is that two capacitors in series' b"can handle twice the output voltage. sometimes two elco's in antiseries" b'(you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large' b'capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.' b'' b'so there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost' b'one.' b'' b"best 73's" b'' b'wouter'
