b'' b"there's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid. i thought" b"i'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant. i splurged" b'and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the' b'highest-paid player is frank thomas, at $900k. i cut some players, like' b'kenny lofton, chris hoiles, keith mitchell, tim wakefield, and a bunch' b'of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a' b'cost of million for the lot of them. the total team salary is' b"$7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300k a player. if that's too steep," b'you can dump thomas and bagwell, replacing them with paul sorrento and' b'a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one' b'of the best teams in the majors.' b'' b'p, juan guzman, b'p, mussina,\t400' b'p, castillo, b'p, eldred, b'p, rhodes,\t155' b'p, militello, b'rp, rojas,\t300' b'rp, beck,\t250' b'rp, melendez, b'rp, hernandez,\t185' b'rp, nied,\t150' b'c, rodriguez,\t275' b'c, piazza, b'1b, thomas,\t900' b'1b, bagwell, b'2b, knoblauch,\t500' b'2b, barberie,\t190' b'3b, gomez,\t312.5' b'3b, palmer,\t250' b'ss, listach,\t350' b'ss, pena,\t170' b'lf, gonzalez,\t525' b'cf, lankford,\t290' b'rf, r.sanders,\t275' b'of, plantier,\t245' b'--' b'ted frank "however teel should have mentioned that though' b'the u of c law school you will probably wind up in jail."' b'standard disclaimers james donald, in misc.legal'
