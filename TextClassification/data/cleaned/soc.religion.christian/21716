b'' b'...' b' safety. to the degree that means other than the death' b' penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the' b' peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred' b' because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the' b' final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.' b'' b'thanks for posting the exact wording which i had not seen' b'previously. the part i quote above seems to me to indicate' b'disapproval of capital punishment it is to be used only when' b'other means are not sufficient; i would say this is a stronger' b'restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when' b'justifiable. i would certainly say there are cases where a' b'crime justifies death (perhaps this is the old testament' b'interpretation), but my reverence for life would say that i' b'would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a new' b'testament interpretation?). it is a matter for debate whether' b'the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that' b"non-violent provisions do not. i don't believe it does, and i" b'would certainly observe that in the usa, where you have the' b'death penalty, there is a far higher murder rate than here in' b'the uk, where we do not.' b'' b'matthew huntbach'
