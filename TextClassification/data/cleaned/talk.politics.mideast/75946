b'' b'it is appropriate to add what himmler said other "inferior races"' b'and "human animals" in his speech at posen and elsewhere:' b'' b'' b'from the speech of reichsfuehrer-ss himmler, before ss' b'major-generals, posen, october b'["nazi conspiracy and aggression", vol. iv, p. b'-------------------------------------------------------------------' b'one basic principal must be the absolute rule for the ss man: we' b'must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own' b'blood and to nobody else. what happens to a russian, to a czech,' b'does not interest me in the slightest. what the nations can offer' b'in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping' b'their children and raising them with us. whether nations live in' b'prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we' b'need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest' b'to me. whether russian females fall down from exhaustion' b'while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as' b'the anti-tank ditch for germany is finished. we shall never be rough' b'and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. we germans,' b'who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude' b'towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these' b'human animals. but it is a crime against our own blood to worry' b'about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and' b'grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. when someone' b'comes to me and says, "i cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women' b'and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them", then i' b'would have to say, "you are a murderer of your own blood because' b'if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, german soldiers will die, and' b'they are the sons of german mothers. they are our own blood".' b'' b'' b'' b"extract from himmler's address to party comrades, september b'["trials of wa criminals", vol. iv, p. b'------------------------------------------------------------------' b'if any pole has any sexual dealing with a german woman, and by this' b'i mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in' b'front of his camp. then the others will not do it. besides,' b'provisions will be made that a sufficient number of polish women' b'and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this' b'kind is out of the question.' b'' b'the women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and' b'where the facts are not sufficiently proved such borderline' b'cases always happen they will be sent to a concentration camp.' b'this we must do, unless these one million poles and those' b'hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict' b'untold damage on the german blood. philosophizing is of no avail' b'in this case. it would be better if we did not have them at all b'we all know that but we need them.' b'' b'' b'' b'-danny keren.' b''
