b'' b'|' b'| hey guys!' b'| i work on many stations and would like this name and current logname' b"| to be in a title of xterm when it's open and a machine name only" b"| when it's closed. in other words, i want $host and $logname to appear" b'| as a title of opened xterm and $host when xterm is closed.' b'| how can i do it?' b'| b'| almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support' b'| escape sequences for it. for your purpose put following into your' b"| .login (if you're using csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modify it." b'| b'| if "$term" "xterm" then' b'| endif' b'| b'|' b'| this is not a feature of the window manager but of xterm.' b'| this sequences are not ansi compatible, are they b'| does anyone know if there are compatible sequences for this and what they' b'| are i would think they are dcs (device control sequence) introduced,' b'| but may be a csi sequence exists, too b'| this must work on a dxterm (vt and ansi compatible), it may not work' b'| on xterms.' b'' b'it works on xterms. at least i have no problem with it. back to the original' b'question:' b'' b'i usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop' b'menu. here is a sample command:' b'' b'xterm -sl -n ls12i -title ls12i -e rlogin ls12i b'' b'the -n and -title options give the text for window and icon. as i use the' b'tcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh), i can do the following:' b'' b'i have an' b'' b"alias precmd echo -n '^[]2\\;${host}:$cwd^g'" b'' b'in my ~/.tcshrc. this is a special alias for tvtwm. it is executed each time' b'before printing the prompt. so, i have the current host name and the current' b'directory path in the title bar of my xterms.' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'____' b'unido ingolf markhof university of dortmund, ls informatik xii' b'___/ p.o. box d-4600 dortmund f.r. germany' b'\\ phone: fax: b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b''
