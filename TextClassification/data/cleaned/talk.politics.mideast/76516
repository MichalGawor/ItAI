b'' b'' b'' b'a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle-east.' b'---------------------------------------------------------- by' b'\t\t\t elias davidsson' b'' b"of all the stupid postings you've brought here recently, it is" b'illuminating that you chose to put your own name on perhaps the' b'stupidest of them.' b'' b'the following proposal is based on the following assumptions:' b'' b'1. fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to' b'education, to establish a family and have children, to human' b'dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are' b'more important to human existence that the rights of states.' b'' b'does this mean that you are calling for the dismantling of the arab' b'states?' b'' b'2. in the event of a conflict between basic human rights and' b'rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.' b'' b'apparently, your answer is yes.' b'' b'6. attempts to solve the israeli-arab conflict by traditional' b'political means have failed.' b'' b'attempts to solve these problem by traditional military means and' b"non-traditional terrorist means has also failed. but that won't stop" b'them from trying again. after all, it is a holy war, you know....' b'' b'7. as long as the conflict is perceived as that between two' b'distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the' b'land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.' b'' b'"no just solution possible." how very encouraging.' b'' b'having stated my assumptions, i will now state my proposal.' b'' b'you mean that it gets even funnier?' b'' b'1. a fund should be established which would disburse grants' b'for each child born to a couple where one partner is israeli-jew' b'and the other palestinian-arab.' b'[...]' b'3. for the first child, the grant will amount to for' b'the second the third child, for each child. for each' b'subsequent child, the grant will amount to for each child.' b'' b'4. the fund would be financed by a variety of sources which' b'have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the' b'israeli-arab conflict,' b'' b'no, the fund should be financed by the center for policy research. it' b"is a major organization, isn't it? isn't it?" b'' b"5. the emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'" b'marriages in israel/palestine, all of whom would have relatives on' b"'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its" b'ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a' b'truly civil society.' b'' b'yeah, just like marriages among arabs has strengthened their' b'societies.' b'' b"the existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of" b'people would also help the integration of israeli society into the' b'middle-east in a graceful manner.' b'' b'the world could do with a bit less middle eastern "grace".' b'' b'objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. i will' b'attempt to identify some of these:' b'' b"boy, you're a one-man band. listen, if you'd like to followup on your" b"own postings and debate with yourself, just tell us and we'll leave" b'you alone.' b'' b'--' b'american-occupied new york have replaced jimmy carter as the' b'my opinions only employer has no opinions. standard of a failed president.'
