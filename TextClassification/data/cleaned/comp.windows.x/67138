b'' b"hi, i'm new to this group so please bear with me!" b'' b'two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation' b"of raster files. with sunview becoming rapidly obselete, i've" b'finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview.' b"i put together a quick test, and i've found that xputimage()" b'is considerably slower (factor of on average?) than the' b'sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory' b'pixrects to a canvas. this was on a sparc ipx. it seems that:' b'(1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down; or' b'(2) xputimage is inefficient...or both! my question is, what' b'is the fastest way in x11r5 to dump plane image data to' b'a window? can i take advantage of the fact that the client is' b'running on the same machine as the server? or am i stuck with' b'xputimage() (in which case i might as well give up now...)?' b'' b'all help appreciated...thanks!' b'' b'derek' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------' b'| derek c. richardson tel: x b'| institute of astronomy fax: b'| cambridge, u.k. b'-----------------------------------------------------------' b''
