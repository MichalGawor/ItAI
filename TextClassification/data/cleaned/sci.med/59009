b'' b'frequently of late, i have been reacting to something added to' b'restaurant foods. what happens is that the inside of my throat starts' b'to feel "puffy", like i have a cold, and also at times the inside of my' b'mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.' b'' b'the situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants' b'(usually chinese), the most notable cases: a cheap chinese fast food' b'chain, a japanese steak house (i had the steak), and another chinese' b'fast food chain where i saw the cook put about a tablespoon or two of' b'what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.' b'' b'i am under the impression that msg "enhances" flavor by causing the' b'taste buds to swell. if this is correct, i do not find it unreasonable' b'to assume that high doses of msg can cause other mouth tissues to swell.' b'' b'also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)' b'involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with msg, this is' b'what i suspect as being the cause.' b'' b"i wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of msg in animals" b'showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab' b'rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.' b'' b'anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are' b'totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied' b'they know of. i will probably respond to them however with a reminder' b'of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the' b'tobacco companies still deny).' b'' b'- dm' b'' b"(if i sound grumpy, it's because i had beef with broccoli for lunch" b'today, and now it hurts to swallow)' b'' b'--' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'dan myers (madman)\t\t| if the creator had intended us to walk' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
