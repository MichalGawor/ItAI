b'' b'increased beverage access (siba), writes:' b'' b'' b'oh? then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places?' b"in particular, three different places where there were no apv's?" b'' b'' b'well, i only saw it start in one place. a tank punched a hole in a wall,' b'and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that' b'a mph wind was blowing. i saw a diagram in usa today yesterday, and' b'fires started at of the holes that the tanks made. a terrible, negligent' b'accident.' b'' b'' b"and if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying" b'to get out of the compound?' b'' b'' b"maybe they couldn't. i've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive" b'in the upstairs of a story house on fire, but it happens all the time.' b"what if they were in sealed rooms, trying to avoid the gas, and didn't know" b'about the fire until it surrounded them? remember the israelis hiding in' b'sealed rooms during desert storm to avoid gas-bearing scuds?' b'' b'cripes, mark, are you really a college student? maybe you ought to stop' b'worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head.' b'ever heard of questioning authority?' b'' b"and besides... oh, i don't know why i'm even bothering." b'' b'' b"ok, i'll buy that. you _do_ seem totally clueless..." b'' b'' b'i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe' b'a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the' b'contrary.' b'' b"wellllll.... they weren't murderous. they'd never harmed or even threatened" b'anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons' b'and hardware. and as far as "evidence", what are you talking about?' b"everything the feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get" b'questioned in detail about it. maybe you and your increased beverage' b'access buddies, sitting around the bar slurring stuff like "they shoulda' b'killed \'em all days ago" don\'t feel that way, but then you\'re probably' b'one of those people still saying about klinton "give the guy a chance, we don\'t' b"even know what he's gonna do!
