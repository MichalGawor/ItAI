b'' b'' b'| i would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on ide controllers.' b'| i would liek to get a ide controller card for my vlb dx2 motherboard.' b'| what are good options for this (preferably under it must also work' b'| under os/2 and be compatible with stacker (and other disk compression s/w).' b'' b'i have a maxtor 212mb on an isa ide controller, although my machine is' b'dx2/66 vlb. i has the save transfer rate of mb/s regardless of' b'the variations of the isa bus speed. i tested it with speed between' b'5.5mhz and 8.33mhz. not _any_ difference. the problem is not the' b'interface between the controller and the memory.' b'' b'my advice: buy 4megs of ram, save and enjoy performance.' b'' b'--' b'' b'disclaimer: all oppinions are mine.' b'' b'' b'i also have a dx2/66 and a maxtor i have a local bus ide controller (generic) and i get' b'985 kb/s. i tried swapping my local bus ide controller for an isa ide controller and my' b'transfer rate went to kb/s. the specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller' b'transfer rate of mb/s. i dont know how to get there from here. the local bus interface' b'got me a little, but certainly not as much as i had hoped. i am also looking for a way to' b'improve my disk performance, but im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck' b'(although im willing to entertain the possibility that it is). i am already running a big' b'main memory disk cache, so im not really interested in this solution either.' b'' b'---' b'chris brinton' b'teradyne, inc.' b'' b'"my opinions are my own, but you\'re welcome to them."' b''
