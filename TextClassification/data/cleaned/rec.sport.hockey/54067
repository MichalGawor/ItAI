b'' b'' b"as if an aluminum stick being taken to ulf's head is gonna solve the problem" b'with violence in the sport of hockey. how the hell can you say the guy is' b'a goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality? saying that hurting' b"a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine. new rules and a new" b'referee system need to be instituted. right now, too many of the real goons' b"get away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:i've seen koharski and van hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the" b'play. even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an' b'improvement.' b'' b"unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... you can't fight," b'so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when' b"the ref isn't looking. ulf has brought this to a high level... players" b'stuck in the past (like neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots' b'are at a disadvantage in the new system.' b'' b'lets face it, a cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective' b'method... it is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of' b"causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. i don't" b"like it, but that's the way the league is going." b'' b'by the way, there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguin-devil' b'game. managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick. (must have been a' b'legal hit... after all, ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do' b'things like that.)' b''
