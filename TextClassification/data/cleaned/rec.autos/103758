b'' b'' b'' b'i thought that the v-10 was originally designed for a truck (not necessarily' b"a pickup!) and then just sort of dropped into the viper's frame because" b'it fit and was available. a friend of mine and i saw (and heard) a viper,' b"and my friend's first response was that it sounded like a truck! it sounded" b"fine to me, but then again, i don't like the whiny noise that most modern" b'sports car engines make. btw, the viper we saw was moving at about 10mph,' b'just like all of the other cars on the freeway heading east out of la' b'on a friday afternoon. looked really nice, though.' b'' b'\tactually, i was under the impression that the v-10 in the viper was' b'not the v-10 that dodge was developing for its new kenworths. i have always' b'thought it was the exhaust system and not the engine that produced the noise' b'of a car...?' b'' b'well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the' b'basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration.' b'in the case of the viper, yes, we are discussing a huge multicylinder 90-deg.' b'engine, which will sound somewhat like a truck. and my understanding, btw, is' b'that that v-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad-' b"aptible for either the trucks or the viper. and from what i've heard (no first" b"hand knowledge it's doing a pretty good job at both." b'' b'and the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degree' b'dohc colombo-designed v-12. period.' b'' b'michael t. chaffee' b'.sig under construction.\t<----excuse'
