b'' b'what are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms?' b'i know des is bits ("tripple des" is bits) and idea is bits. is' b'there anything made in the us that has bit keys? anything anywhere' b"that has larger keys? i've heard that rc2 can be scaled to arbitrarily" b'large keys, but is this actually implemented anywhere?' b'' b"finally, can anyone even concieve of a time/place where bit keys aren't" b"sufficient? (i certainly can't even at a trillion keys a second, it" b'would take about billion years to search just one billionth of that keys' b'space.)' b'' b'thanks,' b'dane'
