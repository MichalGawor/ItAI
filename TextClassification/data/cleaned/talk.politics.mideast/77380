b'' b'' b'' b'' b' "muslim" in ex-yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion. in fact, not' b' all muslims in b-h are followers of islam. therefore, there do (did?)' b' exist in ex-yugoslavia "christian muslims."' b'' b"yeah! that's it! you've really outdone yourself this time nick..." b'don\'t forget the "davidian muslims"... b'' b"islam is not a race. it's a religion. you can be white, black," b"fijian or alaskan. i guess you didn't absorb too much of the malcolm" b'x interest circulating. you see, the whole point of islam is that it' b'stresses equality amongst all peoples. now, i do realize this is' b'difficult for you to comprehend given your staunch beliefs in serbian' b"ethnic cleansing, but give it a try, it's really not that difficult." b'' b'is your stomach all right? unable to digest your lunch?' b'cool down... in the context of bosnia muslims are a nation.' b'and nobody talked about them being a race.' b'' b' it is a' b' civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns' b' instead of pens. the croat, muslim, and serb political leaders *all*' b' chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and' b' peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.' b'' b'terms of secession? you are, of course, joking, right nick? nobody' b'*chose* to fight. bosnia and croatia were *internationally*' b'recognized nations when the serbs attacked and started on their' b"well-documented genocide. that makes them an outside aggressor. it's" b'a simple genocide, a classical example of ethnic cleansing. there is' b'no question of civil war...' b'' b'and yugoslavia was a recognized nation. if you apply the principle' b'of self determination to yugoslavia then you should apply it to' b'croatia and bosnia. of course, you might want to apply again to' b'kossovo.' b'' b'bye,' b'yannis.'
