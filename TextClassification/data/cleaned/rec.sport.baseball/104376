b'' b'' b'some pleasant (and then some not so pleasant) surprises about the b'edition of the bronx bombers so far.' b'' b'first, the pleasant:' b'' b'\t1)spike owen. all through spring training, this guy was' b'\t looking like the second coming of mike gallego, but with' b'\t even worse hitting. now the guy is third in the major leagues' b"\t in ba, and he's ranked pretty high in total hits and runs" b"\t scored. i know it's still early in the season, but he and" b'\t pat kelly (more on him in a minute) have provided a lot of' b"\t spark at the bottom of the order that's given the big guys" b"\t (mattingly, tartabull, o'neill) plenty of rbi opportunities." b"\t let's hope he keeps this up." b'' b'\t2)pat kelly. the guy is finally showing some of the ability' b'\t that led stick michael to label him a "star for the 90s".' b"\t i wouldn't go that far, but kelly looks infinitely improved" b'\t at bat (i guess the tips he took from boggs in spring training' b'\t really paid off. huh! and here i thought boggs would never' b'\t do anything to help anybody besides himself!). and his glove,' b'\t like always, has been terrific (he and mattingly comprise the' b'\t best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball imho).' b'' b"\t3)paul o'neill. we had to get rid of roberto kelly, partly" b'\t because he was under too much pressure in ny to be the next' b"\t barry bonds (he won't do that in cincy, either), and partly" b'\t because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up' b"\t in the second half of the year. i just felt that we could've" b"\t gotten more for him than o'neill. well, so far, o'neill is" b'\t turning out just fine. he looks like he should be able to' b"\t duplicate (if not surpass) mel hall's numbers from last year," b'\t and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around tartabull.' b'\t now, if only buck would play him against lefties some more to' b'\t see what he can do!' b'' b'\t4)wickman. a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack' b'\t morris they never have impressive stats but they always' b'\t find some way to win (although morris seems to be losing that' b'\t ability). i figured that wickman would be the least important' b'\t part of the steve sax trade (best trade since we got that ruth' b'\t guy), maybe winding up as a good middle reliever. but i like what' b"\t i've seen so far. he doesn't pitch pretty, but he gets the job done." b'' b"\t5)key. what's going on here? key was just supposed to provide" b'\t the rotation with some stability (you know, shore up the left' b'\t side, provide experience, get maybe wins), and here this guy' b'\t is *dominating* everybody he faces! who needs maddux or cone b"\t i'll take key any day." b'' b'and now, the not so pleasant surprises:' b'' b"\t1)spike owen. sure, he's hitting like crazy, but the guy *cannot*" b'\t field to save his life! and they said he was brought in to' b'\t provide defense? velarde, stankiewicz, and even silvestri' b'\t are better defensively than owen.' b'' b"remember it's still early. look for his offense to tail off, and his" b'defense to improve (hopefully). he has that rep because i heard that either' b'last year, or over the last years, or something like that he has the third' b'highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops behind c.r. and' b"tony (i'm not gonna help this sorry mets team at all) fernandez. i do agree" b'though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far.' b'' b'\t2)tartabull. the book on tartabull was, keep him healthy and' b"\t he'll produce. well, he hasn't done too much so far. sure. he's" b"\t hit a few homers, but those were all solo shots, and he hasn't" b'\t gotten any of the "big" rbis that your cleanup man is supposed' b'\t to give you. then again, he had a slow start last year (once he' b'\t got off the dl, that is) and turned into a one-man wrecking crew' b"\t late in the year, so we'll see." b'' b'\t3)the bullpen. ugh!!!!!what happened? we were supposed to have' b'\t one of the most solid pens in the majors! meanwhile, the pen' b"\t has already blown three saves (maybe more i haven't checked)." b"\t the great howe/farr lefty/righty tandem? farr's era is in the" b"\t 20s or 30s, and howe's is.....infinite. (i didn't think such" b"\t a thing was possible, but it is). hopefully, they'll get their" b"\t acts together, or else buck's gonna burn out the starters" b"\t for fear that the bullpen'll blow a lead." b'' b'in the immortal words of the scooter, "holy cow, seaver! that johnny key' b'guy can pitch, can\'t he?"' b'' b'see you in the series!' b'' b'-alan'
