b'' b"hi. i've looked in the faq and the o-reilly books and was unable to" b'find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as' b'capslock and numlock. i can certainly track the events inside of my' b'window and set a boolean there, but what if capslock is pressed in' b'another window? i looked at xgrabkey() and decided it was definitely' b'not what i wanted to do. i could find no convenience function to tell' b'me that information.' b'' b'my question is this: is there a means of determining what the state' b'of capslock and/or numlock is?' b'' b'an even more pointed question: is there an easy means of making an x' b'keyboard act like a pc keyboard? ie, capslock is active, and the user' b"presses shift-a, i'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'a'." b'' b'any input is greatly appreciated. please respond via email. i will' b'repost a summary of my findings.' b'' b'thanks, ralph'
