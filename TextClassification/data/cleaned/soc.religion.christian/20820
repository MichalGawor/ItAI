b'' b'' b' not honoring our wives can cause our prayers to be hindered:' b' prayers may not be hindered. i peter b'' b"one interpretation i've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin" b"of physically abusing one's wife. the husband is usually physically" b'stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.' b'he must honor her as his sister in christ. this would therefore be an' b'example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.' b'' b'i would be a bit more specific in looking at this verse in regard to' b"'blocking' prayer. i have trouble thinking that god would allow" b'anything to block our access to him in prayer, especially if we have' b'sinned and are praying for forgivenenss.' b'i can see, however, how our prayer life might be hindered by our' b'sin, if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what has' b'happened, we may not be thinking about prayer, thus our prayers are' b"'hindered' by our own actions." b"but i don't think anything can 'block' the transmission, or" b'reception of prayer to god.' b'shalom, len howard'
