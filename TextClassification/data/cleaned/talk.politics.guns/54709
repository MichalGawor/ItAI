b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i just want to make points:' b'' b'1) the fbi is not stupid. these people are chosen for their intelligence,' b'education, loyalty to the government, etc. they are given much intensive' b'training. so, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any' b"conspiracy here, and say that the fbi was just stupid, i say i don't" b'believe it.' b'' b'2) the fbi has acces to the latest in audio and video technology the' b'latest digital systems. the fbi can manufacture evidence. need a tape of' b'koresh saying, "light the fire", and you can have one. need a thermal' b'imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of' b'computer graphics, you can have one. the thing is, manufacturing these' b'pieces of evidence takes time. so it may be a few more days before we' b"get to see them. or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any" b'fbi video is because it is:' b'1) classified' b'2) too gruesome for our eyes' b'3) lost/got coffee spilled on it' b'' b'dwayne jacques fontenot' b'' b'btw, i get my information from live video feeds. i read the papers too,' b'but almost everything in them contradicts what i have seen with my own eyes.'
