b'' b'help!' b'i am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language' b'characters (in this case norwegian). i have been manipulating the data' b'with excell and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable' b'files to an rs6000 workstation. the norwegian characters show up fine' b'under windows, but appear as "funny" characters on the workstation. the' b'workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem' b'entering the norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard.' b'on further investigation i found that the character codes used by' b'windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the' b'msdos code page. the msdos codes seem to be the same as the' b'workstation. what gives, and how can get around it.' b'please reply by e-mail as i will be out of the office the next few days' b'and will not be reading the news.' b'thanks.'
