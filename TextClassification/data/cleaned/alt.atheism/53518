b'' b'' b'atheists are not' b'mentioned in the quran because from a quranic point of view, and a' b"minute's reasoning, one can see that there is no such thing." b'' b" but there are people who say that they are atheists. if they aren't atheists," b'what are they?' b'' b'when the quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving,' b'communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. this is often' b'interpreted as the much weaker term religion.' b'' b'the atheists are not mentioned in the quran along with jews,' b'mushriqin, christians, etc. because the latter are all din. to have a' b'din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social' b'code. for example the marxist have those, such as history, conflict,' b'etc. that they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent' b'those assuptions does not mean they are any different from the other' b'mushriq, or roughly polytheists.' b'' b'there cannot be social atheism, because when there is a community,' b'that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate' b'the society. when they inscribe assumptions, say nation, or "progress is' b'the natural consequence of human activity" or "parlamentarian' b'democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government", however' b'they individually insist they do not have gods, from the quranic point' b'of view they do. therefore by definition, atheism does not exist.' b'"we are a atheist society" in fact means "we reject the din other than' b'ours".' b'' b'atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/' b'suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that' b'is a personal deviation of belief, and quran tells about such' b'deviations and disbelief. but as i mentioned, from a quranic point of' b'looking at things, there is no atheism in the macro level.' b'' b'i think it took more than one minute.' b'' b'kutluk'
