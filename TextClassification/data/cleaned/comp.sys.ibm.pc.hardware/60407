b'' b':' b': okay, here is my configuration:' b':' b': gateway 433c micronics isa' b': 12mb ram' b': wd212mb ide hd drive c: b': st3144a 125mb ide hd drive d: b': adaptec scsi 1542b controller, with scsi bios enabled' b': seagate st296n 80mb scsi drive' b':' b': alrighty, when i boot up i get the adaptec bios message, but it says' b': something like:' b':' b': "drive c: installed"' b': "drive d: installed"' b': "adaptec scsi bios not installed!"' b':' b": and i can't get to the seagate drive." b':' b': i go into phoenixbios setup, remove the entry for drive d:, and boom, i can' b': access the seagate. is there a way to get two ide drives and the seagate' b': at the same time? i have aspi4dos.sys, but it just hangs the system.' b':' b': brian' b':' b'' b'there is a simple answer. if my memory serves me the scsi bios will only' b'work as the first or second drive. any "built-in" drives e.g. ide are' b'installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install' b'as the next drive. but if there are already two drives, then no can do.' b'' b'the solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the' b'scsi bios (as it is useless in your case). it works like a champ! i' b'have seen a similar situation before.' b'' b'good luck' b'' b'gordon lang' b''
