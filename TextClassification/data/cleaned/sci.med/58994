b'' b'as nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous' b'question "why do you need to put msg in almost every food?" i must assume' b"that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than i hoped it was." b'' b'she believes that msg is added to food to cause people to eat more of it' b'and not quit when they shoud be sated. to put it a different way, she' b'believes that for some people msg causes them to act toward food like an addict.' b'(eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup you get the' b'idea! if she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the' b'food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!! can msg' b'be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit' b'forming) b'' b'this brings up a side question of mine. i have noticed that cats (my' b"children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet" b'food. the cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other' b'brand. i have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some' b'sort of chemical training or addiction. my questions, for the net, are:' b'does the fda regulate the contents of pet food? is it allowed for pet' b'food to contain addictive or conditioning substances? is msg put in' b'pet food?' b'' b'-----------------------------------' b'i speak for myself and not motorola' b'-----------------------------------' b'' b'--' b'walter lundby' b''
