b'' b'' b' what evidence indicates that gamma ray bursters are very far away?' b'' b'their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,' b"crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution." b'' b'how can you tell the difference between an intensity distribution which' b'is due to an "edge" in the spatial distribution and an intensity' b'distribution which is due an a sharp dropoff of intrinsic luminosities' b'below a certain threshold? could you describe (roughly) what the' b'intensity distribution is like?'
