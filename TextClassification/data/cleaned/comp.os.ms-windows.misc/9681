b'' b'hi,' b"we've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a" b'serial printer (dmp or laser). i have used works and windows write. the' b'output is ok from dos and if i send plain text output, but anything' b"fancy garbles or just doesn't output. the exception is outputting to a" b"lserjet which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to" b"bother about handshaking messages. i'm sure i'm not alone in this. i've" b'tried most of the print/network manager options i can think of. anyone' b"had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it??" b'thanks' b'' b'john atherton' b'' b'' b'' b''
