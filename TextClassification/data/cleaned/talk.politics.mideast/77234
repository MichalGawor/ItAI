b'' b'' b'i consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the' b'right to have a state based on religious belief is a form of racism.' b'' b"although i don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily i disagree. any" b'discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the' b'sole qualification for religious membership is racial. this is not the' b'case for israel although it might get a little closer than, say, islam.' b'this of course raises the vexed question of church antisemitism. jews' b'have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in' b'many christian countries. if we take russia as an example jews were' b'seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the church' b'and state stopped at the baptismal font. officially anyway. if a jew' b'converted there were no legal barriers in his way (that i know of anyway.)' b"peter the great's interior minister came from such a convert background." b'can we then claim that the russian orthodox did not teach antisemitism' b'and was not antisemitic? similarly for the roman catholic church? i' b"suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief" b'and as is after all a form of racism. well maybe not. what is' b'antisemitism then if not something racially based? i wonder if hitler' b"killed converts of 'pure' german blood. does anyone know one way or" b'the other?' b'' b'joseph askew' b'' b'--' b'joseph askew, gauche and proud in the autumn stillness, see the pleiades,' b'disclaimer? sue, see if i care north of our tents, the sky must end somwhere,' b'actually, i rather like brenda beyond the pale, the river murmurs on.'
