b'' b'' b'' b' rm:just a short thought:' b' when you ask the question of the "authorities" or sponsors of buyback' b' programs whether they will check for stolen weapons and they answer' b' "no, it\'s total amnesty".' b'' b' please note that the given for each firearm, in the boston `buy' b' back\' will not be in cash, but money orders. how much `total amnesty" can' b' you get if you leave paper trail behind?' b'' b'in the latest case in denver, they were giving away tickets to a denver' b'nuggets basketball game.' b'' b"how traceable is a money order? (i don't know. haven't used one in years)" b'' b'money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties being' b"supposed to sign them. i assume you'd have to show the buy-back people" b"an id, and you'd then have a money order made out to that id." b'' b"as far as traceable as a practical matter, i don't know, it would" b"depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is" b"on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in. i'd say" b'certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who' b'they gave money orders out to.' b'' b"is that even an issue if the weapons aren't checked for being stolen?" b'' b'there might be some questions asked, i suppose, if somebody' b'brought in a number of weapons each time over a series of "buy back"' b'programs.' b'' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group' b"your pushed me down the elevator shaft; i'm beginning to think you don't" b'love me anymore."
