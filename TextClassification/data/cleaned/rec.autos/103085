b'' b'' b'[long silly discussion deleted...]' b'' b" and while you're at it, why bother with removing" b'the drain plug when you could remove the dipstick instead and suck it out from' b'there with your mouth and then spit it out?' b'' b"this suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. years ago in another" b'time and place, i used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive' b'engines. in many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under' b'the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various' b"floation chambers on each side. and if you *did* get something there, you'd" b'spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.' b'' b'so we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out' b'the dipstick hole. there was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed' b'to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the' b"outlet side that you put into any convenient container. i'm sure these" b'gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.' b'' b'mart l. molle' b'computer systems research institute' b'university of toronto' b'toronto, canada m5s 1a4' b'(416)978-4928'
