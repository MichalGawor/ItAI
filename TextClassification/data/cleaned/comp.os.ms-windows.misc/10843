b'' b"i'm waiting for june first to roll around when i can then get my" b'hands on pc-solaris...unix for the intel chip! i know that there' b'are many of other unix possibilities out there, but this includes' b'the wabi (windows api binary interface...i think) technology that wil' b'run windows apps straight outta da box. if this flies in enhanced mode,' b"then here's another contender to look out for in the corporate/education" b'market.' b'' b'too big and complex for the home front...windows 4/mac sys7 will take those' b'while win4wkgrps nt os/2 will fight it out for the small-to-mid businesses.' b'' b'however, once the powerpc becomes available (especially in laptop/notebook form)' b'then these will migrate into all markets....the ability to connect up to a unix' b'machine at work and yet still run windows/mac apps at home is going to be real' b'attractive to alot of people!!!' b'' b'just my predictions.' b'' b'mike' b'' b'--' b'___________________________________________________________________________' b'740 elm st. apt#4 ccli senior technical consultant' b'hancock, mi michigan technological university'
