b'' b'' b'i\'m wondering if "vandalize" is the proper word to use in this situation. my' b'dictionary defines "vandalism" as "the willful or malicious destructuion of' b'public or private property, especially of anything beautiful or artisitc." i' b'would agree the sky is beautiful, but not that it is public or private property.' b'' b"it's public because it belongs to everybody." b'' b'no, the sky does not, at this time, belong to anyone. ownership is necessary' b'to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the' b"action was good or bad. if neither you or i own a brick wall, then i can't" b"unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right, and you don't" b'have the authority to declare that it is wrong. the owner may find it artistic' b'or she may be call the police.' b'' b'(this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights)' b'' b"it's vandalism because many people power companies do maliciously waste light." b'' b'"maliciously" implies evil intent. the lighting companies aren\'t going out' b"of their way to spoil the sky. they just don't care." b'' b'if they can sell you' b'or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes to percent' b'of its light, they make more _money_. never mind that your money is wasted.' b'' b'it is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware.' b"if that's what your city will buy, that's what the lighting company will sell." b'write a letter to city hall.' b'' b"please note that i'm not defending light pollution. the orignial focus of" b'this thread was space based light sources.' b'' b'' b'--' b'"find a way or make one."' b'-attributed to hannibal'
