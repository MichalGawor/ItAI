b'' b'i would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for humans.' b'i am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range' b'of physical aspects of the planet. the question is what physical aspects' b'simply disallow earth like conditions.' b'' b'eg temperature range of 280k to 315k (where temp is purely dependant on dist' b'from the sun and the suns temperature..)' b'atmospheric presure i know nothing of human tolerance' b'planetary mass again gravity at surface is important, how much' b'can human bodies take day after day. also how does the mass effect' b'atmosphere. i thinking of planets between and times mass of the' b'earth. i suppose density should be important as well.' b'' b'climate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc. just the above' b'three factors and how they relate to one another.' b'' b'jonathan' b'--' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'with fearsome eyes and fiery breath the dragon burnt the girl to death' b'-- from "too late saint george"'
