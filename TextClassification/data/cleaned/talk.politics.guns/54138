b'' b'' b'| what about guns with non-lethal bullets, like rubber or plastic bullets.' b'| would those work very well in stopping an attack?' b'|' b'| \t\t\t\t\t\tdoug holland' b'' b'any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially' b'lethal. even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the' b'muzzle is in close proximity to the victim. i have heard of rubber or' b'plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the' b"intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also" b'seen reports of deaths caused by them [the british in northern ireland].' b'use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the' b'gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to' b'be a proper reaction [and so does the law].' b'furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force' b'has its own set of problems. it may well take more applications of the' b'less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some' b'risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent' b'since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be' b'more deadly.' b'' b'--' b'(and last but not least a disclaimer) these opinions are mine..'
