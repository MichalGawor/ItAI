b'' b' a friend of mine recently acquired an gc card for his iisi' b' and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white.' b' i know there have been numerous reports about the worth of' b' the gc, but i was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little' b' more on the subject. any replies encouraged. thanks in ad-' b' vance.' b'' b' \t\t\t\t\t\tjoe kasanic' b'' b'' b"i've had similar problems w/ other board types, and the problem is not a" b'result of the 8/24gc board! try zapping the pram by holding down' b'"command-option-p-r" durring startup! you will have to reset everything to' b'your previous preferences (the date time remain intact!), but the video' b"board will start remembering it's previous settings!" b'' b'anthony d. saxton' b'elenay creations'
