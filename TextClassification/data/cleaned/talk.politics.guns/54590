b'' b'' b'well, after days of hearing that of the bd bodies had' b'been shot in the head (horrors! another jonestown! crazed' b'cultists! child abusers! whackos in waco!), last night the' b'medical examiner was on tv and was pretty vehement in denying' b'that any of them had bullet wounds... he seemed just a tad upset' b"at the feds for having spread that rumor.
