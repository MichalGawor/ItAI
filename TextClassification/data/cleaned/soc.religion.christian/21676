b'' b"ok, what's more important to gay christians? sex, or christianity?" b'christianity i would hope. would they be willing to forgo sex' b'completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,' b'to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong,' b'etc? if not, why not? heterosexuals abstain all the time.' b'(it would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders' b'to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life)' b'' b'the biblical arguments against homosexuality are weak at best, yet' b'christ is quite clear about our obligations to the poor. how as' b'christians can we demand celibacy from homosexuals when we walk' b'by homeless people and ignore the pleas for help?' b'christ is quite clear on our obligations to the poor.' b'' b'thought for the day:' b'' b"mat and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but" b'considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? or how wilt thou say to' b'thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam' b'is in thine own eye?' b'--' b'| the love of christ is contagious.' b'--+-- mat woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are' b'| like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward,' b"| but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness."
