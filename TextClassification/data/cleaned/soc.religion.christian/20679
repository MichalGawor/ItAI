b'' b'' b'hello all. we are doing a bible study (at my college) on revelations. we' b'have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable' b'interpretation. we are now on chapters and which talk about the' b'woman on the beast and the fall of babylon. i believe the beast is the' b'antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents' b'babylon which stands for rome or the roman catholic church. what are some' b'views on this interpretation? is the falling babylon in chapter the same' b'babylon in as in chapter the catholic church?' b'hate to step on toes.' b'thanks' b'' b'--------' b'muskingum college' b'' b'[reading this imagery as the roman catholic church was certainly' b'common in earlier protestant writers. a lot of us find that frankly' b'embarassing now, though some of our readers will certainly advocate' b'such a position. the problem is that the description makes it look a' b"lot like a political entity. it's associated with kings, controls" b'world commerce, is seated on seven mountains recall that rome' b"is traditionally regarded as built on seven hills). if it's a church," b"then it's not the current roman catholic church, but a church that has" b'been taken over by the anti-christ and merged with the state, turning' b'into something rather different than it is now. presumably in such a' b'scenario the true catholics are among those who are persecuted. given' b'the overall impression that satan is pretending to be an angel of' b'light, and the true church is a persecuted remnant, i think the most' b'consistent playing out of the image would be that the anti-christ' b'would be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of both' b'the protestant and catholic traditions, but that the true spiritual' b'descendants of both peter and the reformers are equally being' b'persecuted. --clh]'
