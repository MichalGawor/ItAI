b'' b"i'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? i've been" b"doing it my self over miles, on my current toyota truck i've got" b"over 150k. i've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a" b'transmission. my experiences suggest otherwise. what techniques do you use?' b'' b'on some old pieces of junk i drove, the transmission was so' b'worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.' b"to date i've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords a chevy. some where" b'harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother' b'quicker easier they where to shift.' b'' b'my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently' b'wrist back on the shift lever. if for some reason i miss the shift window,' b"i lightly press the accelerator try agian. i've found that clutchless" b'shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms i also skip gears some' b'times using b'' b'krispy'
