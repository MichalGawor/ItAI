b'' b'| i would be most thrilled if some kind person could help me with the following' b'| given a cylinder in 3d -defined as a line segment between two points and' b'| a radius (e.g. sx,sy,sz to ex,ey,ez and r), what is the easiest (and not' b'| too expensive) way to find if a ray -defined as another line through two' b'| points -cuts through this cylinder and if so where?' b'' b'| i think the test for touching is rather simple: if the closest approach' b'| of the two lines is less than r, then the ray does penetrate the cylinder.' b'' b"nope, this won't work for a cylinder. you can have a line arbitrarily close" b'to the the cylinder backbone, and yet not intersect it. the test works for a' b'pillbox, though. (a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends.)' b'' b'| thanks,' b'' b'-arun' b'--'
