b'' b'' b'| is there such a thing as msg (monosodium glutamate) sensitivity?' b'| i saw in the ny times sunday that scientists have testified before' b'| an fda advisory panel that complaints about msg sensitivity are' b'| superstition. anybody here have experience to the contrary?' b'| b"| i'm old enough to remember that the issue has come up at least" b'| a couple of times since the 1960s. then it was called the' b'| "chinese restaurant syndrome" because chinese cuisine has' b'| always used it.' b'' b"| so far, i've seen about a dozen posts of anecdotal evidence, but" b'| no facts. i suspect there is a strong psychological effect at' b'| work here. does anyone have results from a scientific study' b'| using double-blind trials?' b'' b'here is another anecdotal story. i am a picky eater and never wanted to' b'try chinese food, however, i finally tried some in order to please a' b'girl i was seeing at the time. i had never heard of chinese restaurant' b'syndrome. a group of us went to the restaurant and all shared different' b"dishes. it didn't taste great, but i decided it wasn't so bad. we went" b'home and went to bed early. i woke up at am and puked my guts outs.' b"i threw up for so long that (i'm not kidding) i pulled a muscle in" b"my tongue. dry heaves and everything. no one else got sick, and i'm" b'not allergic to anything that i know of.' b'' b'suffice to say that i wont go into a chinese restaurant unless i am' b'physically threatened. the smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is*' b'a psycholgical reaction). when i have been dragged in to suffer' b'through beef and broccoli without any sauces, i insist on no msg.' b"i haven't gotten sick yet." b'' b'--' b'doug bank private systems division'
