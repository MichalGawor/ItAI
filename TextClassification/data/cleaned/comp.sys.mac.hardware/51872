b'' b'the subject says what i would like to do, here are the details:' b'' b'i have a 512ke with the macrescue upgrade board that makes it the' b'equivalent of a plus (system and macenvy both identify it as such).' b'' b'the macrescue board clips onto the on the mb. it also has' b'a itself. periodically i have to remove the clip (not an' b'entirely easy thing to do) and clean the "legs" of the b"larry pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with" b'snap on upgrades: the 68000\'s "legs" will oxidize, causing' b'unusual system errors.' b'' b"well, that's me." b'' b'so, i would like to do something permanent, and i think it would be' b'fairly easy to put a socket in where the currently is, and' b"modify the macrescue board to plug in. what i'm not sure of" b"is whether it will work. it seems to me that the two 68000s aren't" b"acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on" b"the performance of my mac. i'm about sure." b'' b'will someone provide the extra b'' b'erik' b''
