b'' b'' b" i'm wondering if i can tote my american touch tone phone around with me" b" to sweden and germany. it's dc powered, and i can buy a special adapter" b' for that in europe. the question is if the general electronics work' b" the same. i can buy a different wall plug and refit it (i'm sure i'd" b' have to), but would that do the trick?' b'' b'two things to watch for:' b'in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some' b'of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the' b'phone can be set to pulse dialing.' b'' b'most (if not virtually all) swedish exchanges can handle tone' b'dialling. many older electromechanical exchanges have been modified' b'accept tone dialling.' b'--' b"swedish institute of computer science phone (intn'l): b"box telefon (nat'l): b's-164 kista, sweden fax:
