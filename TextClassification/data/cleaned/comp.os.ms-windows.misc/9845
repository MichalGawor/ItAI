b'' b'' b'' b' somewhere in this thread, it has been said that windows nt (tm) is a' b" multi-user os, as well as multi-threading, etc. i certainly haven't" b' seen this to be the case. there are seperate accounts for each person,' b" and even seperate directories if that is desired. i don't see an" b' implentation of simultaneuos use though.' b'' b' since running any gui over a network is going to slow it down by a' b' fair amount, i expect windows nt will be multiuser only in the sense' b' of sharing filesystems. someone will likely write a telnetd for it so' b' one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have' b' to be shared by running the executables on the local cpu. this is how' b' things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are' b' taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups.' b'' b' note that the next does this: you can always telnet into a next and' b" run character-based apps but you can't run the gui. (yeah, i know" b" about x-windows, just haven't been too impressed by it...).." b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b' b' b' iskandar taib the only thing worse than peach ala' b'' b'' b'' b'i read this in an electronic "magazine" about nt:' b'' b'"and for all the hoopla about nt, one would' b"think the thing would be multi-user but it's not. it supports" b'only one user at a time. it can support multiple clients but' b'only one actual user."' b'' b'' b'your mileage may vary!' b'' b'--' b'this posting does not represent the opinions of my employers.' b'------------------------------------------------------------------' b'"i\'m afraid i\'ll have to ask you to leave the store, mam" ash, aod' b'=================================================================='
