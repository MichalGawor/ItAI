b'' b'a while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing f' b'iltered grey scale images into one true color image. this is possible because' b"it's the same theory used by most color scanners. i am not looking for the obv" b'ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what i do need is those equat' b'ions becasue i am starting to write software which will automate the conversion' b'process. i would really appreciate it if someone would repost the equations' b'/3 unknowns. thanks for the help!!!'
