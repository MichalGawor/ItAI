b'' b'' b'' b'and ms. regard, please don\'t give us the trite "you can\'t legislate' b'morality" nonsense again: there is little else that is legislated,' b'including the moral concept of "rights".' b'' b'really? pure socialism had this belief, and fell flat on its ass by' b'attempting to follow such reasoning. suppose you pass a law that' b'states that i must love my neighbour, regardless of race, religion,' b'etc. how exactly do you plan to enforce such a law? better yet, how' b'do you plan to measure compliance? and even if you overcome those' b'two obstacles, how will you ever know if i have become *more moral*' b'or not?' b'' b'you either missed the point or are being somewhat disingenuous; i have' b'never heard anyone suggest that you can legislate what people think.' b'laws are based on either expediency (i.e. traffic laws) or morality (i.e.' b'human rights), as far as i can tell, and the majority are based on the' b'latter.' b'' b'once more around the racetrack. see the original statement that it is' b'nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality. i simply stated' b'that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them' b'will make you or i more moral people. they may make us act in a moral' b'manner, but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to' b'risk punishment. they say nothing about whether we have become more' b'moral or not. perhaps the distinction is too fine.' b'' b'' b'' b'matt freivald' b'' b'tog' b'' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------' b' "i\'m not a feminist i\'m for equal rights!"' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------' b" if you don't believe in abortion, don't have one!" b" if you don't believe in slavery, don't own one!" b" if you don't believe in murder, don't commit one!" b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------' b' pro child. pro family. pro life.' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'these are my opinions only and not those of my employer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------'
