b'sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous nazi boyadjian. the moslem' b'districts were burnt down. hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed' b'and hundreds of civilians also perished.' b'' b'armenians first of all occupied the talori region, which included' b'the villages of siner, simai, gulli-guzat, ahi, hedenk, sinank,' b'ekind, effard, musson, etek, akcesser. leaving their wives,' b'children and property in these inaccessible spots, the armenians' b'joined forces with other armed bands coming from the silvan' b'districts in the plain of mus, after which the whole body of' b'3000 men gathered in the andok mt. five or six hundred wished' b'to surround mus, and started off by attacking the delican tribe to' b'the south of the city. they slaughtered a number of the tribe and' b'seized their goods. the religious beliefs of the muslims who fell' b'into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the muslims' b'themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. the rebels' b'also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of mus, but the' b'large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from' b'occupying the city.' b'' b'the rebels joined the bandits in the andok mts., carrying out' b'the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the' b"neighbourhood. they burned omer agha's nephew alive. they" b"raped a number of turkish women at a spot three or four hours'" b'distance from gulli-guzat and then strangled them.' b'' b'at the beginning of august the rebels attacked the faninar,' b'bekiran and badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible' b'atrocities. the rebels in the villages of yermut and ealigernuk in' b'the nahiye of cinan in the kaza of cal attacked the kurds in the' b'neighbourhood, as well as the villages of kaisser and catcat.' b'' b'towards the end of august, the armenians attacked the' b'kurds in the vicinity of mus and burned down three or four' b'villages, including gulli-guzat. as for the rebels in talori,' b'they continued to spread death and destruction among the' b'muslims and other christian communities, refusing to lay down' b'their arms.' b'' b'source: uras, esat: the armenians in history.
