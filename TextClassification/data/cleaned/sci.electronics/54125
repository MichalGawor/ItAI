b'' b'' b'the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a' b"colder lead-acid battery self-discharges at a slightly faster rate. that's" b"why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works" b'to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery' b"thermally. it you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it will" b'self-discharge even slower.' b'' b'there are a number of inaccuracies here:' b'1) in fact, a colder battery will self-discharge more slowly. this is why' b'batteries should be stored in a cool, dry place.' b'2) an battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed' b'on wood. the battery, the wood, and the concrete will all be at the' b'same general temperature (ignoring temperature fluctuations) and thus' b'none will effect the other.' b'' b'the best thing would be to attach a small load' b'such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it' b'on constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to "shallow-' b'cycle" the charge in the battery. such mild "exercising" of a lead-acid' b'battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for' b'storage.' b'' b"there is no need to 'exercise' the battery. just keep it charged. (a trickle" b'charger will do the job.)' b'' b'[stuff deleted]'
