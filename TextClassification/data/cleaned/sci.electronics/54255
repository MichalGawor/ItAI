b'' b'i would like to hook up some cameras that were recently donated to our' b'local community cable tv station which have sync inputs in the form' b'of horizontal and vertical drive. our station sync is a black burst' b'which works fine with other boxes with "genlock" style inputs. can' b'anyone point me at a design, article, or whatever showing how to produce' b'the horizontal vertical drive signals?' b'' b"check the station's master sync generator. you'll probably find that" b"it already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't" b"being used. a couple of cables and you're in business." b'' b'another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with hd and vd' b'outputs genlock it to station sync, and then feed hd and vd to the' b'cameras.' b'' b"if neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a sync" b'separator. look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators b'they probably all include circuitry that does what you want.' b'' b'dave'
