b'' b'hi,' b'' b' have you used mac system 6.x or 7.x? if the answer is positive, you would' b'know if ms-windows is a "mature" os.' b'' b'this is silly. is unix a mature os? depends on who you ask, and how' b'you define mature. system is, if anything, less mature than windows b'' b' days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real os. i can see why' b'they have such question. ms-windows confuses many people. microsoft' b'simulated mac, but it did a lousy job. for example:' b'' b'(1) you can not create hierarchy groups. there is no way to create a group' b' in a group. (if you know how, please tell me.)' b'' b'so why do you need something like behierarchic to create groups under' b'the apple menu? everyone knows that apple menu items are a ripoff of' b'the program manager. if you want a hierarchic program launcher there' b'are lots available.' b'' b"(3) uncomplete documentation. it's not easy to find the reason why causes" b' an unpredictable error.' b'' b'and this is easy on a mac? give me a break. having spent hours moving' b'system extensions around and restarting the mac to see why a certain' b'app crashes all the time, i find this laughable.' b'' b'(4) group deleting/file deleting' b' after deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.' b' but if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full' b' of nonsense files.' b'' b'oh great. ever hear of aliases? wonder why apple implemented them.' b'' b'(5) share problem' b' once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some' b' language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. you just' b' can not open or save the program if it is loaded. it makes sense to' b' prevent from saving, but not opening.' b'' b"eh?? i don't follow." b'' b" it's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if microsoft want to" b'keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more' b'carefully before products distribute.' b'' b'why is it that i find the mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever i' b'use it?' b'' b' no flame, please.' b'' b'yeah right. you post flame bait, yet ask for no flames.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'iskandar taib the only thing worse than peach ala'
