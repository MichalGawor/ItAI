b'' b'' b'it is still easy to conceal super-encryption, at least until the' b'inquisitors get ahold of the k key, which can take a while,' b'presumably not in near-real-time. (worst-case, in which the escrow agencies' b'provide the u key to the local cops, still only gets one side of the' b'conversation per warrant, unless the same key is used for both directions,' b'which i suppose the capstone version of the chip will probably insist on.)' b'' b"i was under the impression (from reading denning's description of the" b"clipper's operation) that the same session key *is* used in both directions for" b"encrypting the message text, but that each chip uses it's own key for" b'encrypting the session key into the law-enforcement field. so, you only' b'need to know the u key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the' b'messages in both directions.'
