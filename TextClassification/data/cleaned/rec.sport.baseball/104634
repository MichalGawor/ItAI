b'' b'' b'i suppose a foul ball machine (like brett butler) is pretty valuable,' b"but i'd rather watch (and root for) the lower obp guys who can" b'actually hit the ball.' b'' b'now *this* is a legitimate point. baseball is entertainment, and i have no' b'quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than' b"others, regardless of their win-value. personally, i'm a huge fan of the" b"slug-bunt; i doubt it's a high-percentage play, but i get a big kick out of" b'it. i am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.' b'' b"of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that galarraga's" b'inability to defer gratification isn\'t hurting his team because he "isn\'t' b'paid to walk" or "is an rbi guy" or whatever.' b'' b"and finally, i'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw" b'their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike' b'to them, than because they have a great "eye"' b'' b"i'm not sure. i used to think this was true, but more and more i'm becoming" b"convinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical" b'ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the' b'chance to do it a lot.' b'' b"let's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether" b'they are power threats and whether they walk a lot:' b'' b'' b'power\t\t\tno power' b'' b'patient\t\tfrank thomas\t\tbrett butler' b'barry bonds\t\tozzie smith' b'mark mcgwire\t\tcraig grebeck' b'babe ruth\t\tmiller huggins' b'ted williams\t\tbilly hamilton' b'rickey henderson\teddie joost' b'joe morgan\t\tmike hargrove' b'.\t\t\t b'.\t\t\t b'.\t\t\t b'' b'impatient\ternie banks\t\tozzie guillen' b'dave kingman\t\tshawon dunston' b'joe carter\t\tandres thomas' b'george bell\t\tjose lind' b'kirby puckett\t\tdevon white' b'etc.' b'' b'as far as i can tell, all the categories are full. it really looks like the' b'two are independent. nobody could possibly be *afraid* of craig grebeck at' b'the plate, and yet he walks quite a lot. part of that, undoubtedly, is being' b'small of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of' b'target at least times out of randy milligan is an even better example;' b"he's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all" b'over the place, despite his huge strike zone.' b'' b'' b'--' b'member iie, orsa, tims, sabr hands not soft, eye not discerning' b'| and in denver they call you a slugger?' b'"the big catullus" galarraga and compare you to my own mattingly!?'
