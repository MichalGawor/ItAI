(it was in athens, on the street leading' b"to the american embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up" b'with tear-gas; i must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the' b'next day.) aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.,' b'the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling' b'to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---i was horrified and' b"wondered what disease or other health problem i had.
