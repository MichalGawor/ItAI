b'' b'' b': the discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all? b'' b': one of the laws of nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate' b": (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event. no" b': reasonable alternative exists.' b'' b'i would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;' b'causes precede their effects. but if you claim that there must be' b'an answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime) emerge from' b'"nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.' b'' b'i have always wondered why christians use the "there are questions' b'science (or atheism) cannot answer" argument; i hope this is the' b'appropriate group to ask this question.' b'' b'the most popular question is the question of origins. why does the' b'universe exist, or anything, for that matter?' b'' b'i think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely' b'' b'1) why is there existence? why anything exists?' b'' b'and' b'' b'2) how did the universe emerge from nothing?' b'' b'it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. however,' b'is it a meaningful question, after all?' b'' b"i would say it isn't. consider the following:" b'' b'a die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt' b"one's very existence. since it is so easy to doubt everything else b'i cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me b'can i ever be sure i exist?' b'' b'however, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (someone' b'insert an appropriate shakespeare quote here b'' b"a being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence." b"a being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be" b'pointless the being would exist anyway.' b'' b'let us return to the original question: why? a being that does not' b'exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. this being' b'is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let' b'us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity' b'postulate). the question "why anything exists" can be countered by' b'demanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness,' b'or in non-existence". actually, both questions turn out to be' b"devoid of meaning. things that exist do, and things that don't exist" b"don't exist. tautology at its best." b'' b'i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question.' b'' b'some christians i have talked to have said that actually, god is' b'himself the existence. however, i see several problems with this' b'answer. first, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is' b'actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and' b'them. this is pantheism, not christianity.' b'' b'another answer is that god is the _source_ of all existence.' b'this sounds much better, but i am tempted to ask: does god' b'himself exist, then? if god is the source of his own existence,' b'it can only mean that he has, in terms of human time, always' b'existed. but this is not the same as the source of all existence.' b'this argument sounds like god does not exist, but meta-exists,' b'and from his meta-existent perspective, he created existence.' b'i think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.' b'' b'the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable' b'of understanding such questions. being an atheist myself, i do not' b'accept such answers, since i do not have any other methods.' b'' b'the second question: how did the universe emerge from nothing?' b'belongs to the domain of science, and i, for one, do not doubt the' b'question can be answered by its methods. many cosmologists have' b'suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge' b'from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent' b'hawking biography; see also lizhi shuxian: creation of the universe,' b'world scientific, however, i think the sci groups are more' b'appropriate for discussions like this.' b'' b': as far as i can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why". that isn\'t' b': true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).' b'' b'this is not true. science is a collection of models telling us "how",' b'not why, something happens. i cannot see any good reason why the "why"' b'questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the' b'supernatural domain exists. if supernatural beings exist, it is' b'as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.' b'' b': i believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,' b': but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,' b": reproducing life, *ever*.
