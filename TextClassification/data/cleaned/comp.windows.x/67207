b'' b' my question is this: is there a means of determining what the state' b' of capslock and/or numlock is?' b'' b'alright. ignore this. i have delved a bit deeper (xkeyevent) and' b'found what i was looking for.' b'' b'ev-state has a bunch of masks to check against (lockmask is the one' b'for capslock). unfortunately, it appears that the numlock mask varies' b'from server to server. how does one tell what mask is numlock and' b'which are for meta (mod1mask, mod2mask, mod3mask, mod4mask, mod5mask).' b"eg, sgi's vendor server has mod2mask being numlock, whereas solaris" b'1.0.1 openwindows has mod3mask for numlock. is there an' b"unambiguous means of determining numlock's mask at runtime for any" b'given server? sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.' b'' b'thanks, ralph' b''
