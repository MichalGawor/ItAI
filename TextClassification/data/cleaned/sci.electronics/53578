b'' b'' b'i was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a simple' b'way to make a 4-band equalizer (single channel). i need it to accept' b'line inputs (tape deck, cd player, etc.) and output to the same! so' b'input impedance should equal output impedance. also, since i am driving' b'a line, i would need volt p-p output. final requirement is that i' b'can either:' b'1. control it digitally' b'or' b'2. control it easily, or with few resistors' b'' b'finally if anyone knows of any filter or equalizer chips, that might' b'be useful, please let me know. (i have seen a couple of them from national,' b'and maxim). thanks in advance,' b'martin'
