b'' b'' b'sketch: rotate so cylinder axis is z axis.' b'' b'intersect x/y projection of line with projected cylinder (similar to,' b'but easier than, sphere intersection). result: no intersection, one' b'intersection, or two intersections, parameterized along line by t0 and' b't1. now look at z, and compute intersections of line with top and' b"bottom planes of cylinder. this gives t0' and t1'. the interval of" b"intersection is then the bit of the line from [t0,t1] intersect [t0',t1']." b'' b'details left as an exercise for the reader.' b'' b'=s' b'--' b'=spencer w. thomas \t\t| info tech and networking, b1911 cfob, b'"genome informatician"\t| univ of michigan, ann arbor, mi
