b'' b'there was a recent discussion of dungeons and dragons and other role' b'playing games. since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and' b'science fiction and fantasy fans, i will mention that i am the editor' b'and publisher of radio free thulcanra, a christian-oriented science' b'fiction fanzine. it is not a christian magazine with a special' b'interest in science fiction. it is a science fiction fanzine with a' b'special interest in christianity. gaming is not a major topic of' b'discussion but it has come up in some letters. (no, there are no' b'arguments about whether d&d is satanic. people who think it is are' b'not likely to be reading rft.) anyway, i am now working on the april' b'issue. i will send a sample copy to any reader of' b'soc.religion.christian who requests it. it is printed on paper, so' b'requests should include a snail-mail address.' b'-------' b'marty helgesen' b'' b'"what if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation?"'
