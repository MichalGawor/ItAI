b'' b'' b'i have a project in mind that requires an array of leds that can be addressed' b'individually by a microprocessor (say, 16x16 or so). is there an lsi that' b'is designed to drive an led array (including ram to hold the array state),' b"or failing that, some way of multiplexing the display so i don't have to" b'latch a bit for each led using a discrete latch? (i want to avoid having' b'a huge board covered with 373s if possible!) thanks in advance...' b'' b'maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want. the max7219 drives b"7 segment led displays with full decode or drives discrete led's with" b'a wire serial interface. the chips can also be cascaded to allow very' b'large arrays. i am working on a sign display using this part.' b'' b"i'll have to post the contact info for maxim later, it's at home. there was" b"a series of articles on this chip in the last couple of circuit cellar ink's." b'' b'mike harpe' b'--' b'michael harpe, programmer/analyst information technology, ormsby bldg.' b'(502)588-5542 louisville, ky. b'"he\'s not a man, he\'s a remorseless eating machine!" the simpsons'
