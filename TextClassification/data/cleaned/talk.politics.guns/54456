b'' b' as far as "john q. public with a gun," the supreme court has already' b' ruled in cases such as us v. miller u.s. and us v.' b' verdugo-urquidez s. ct. that that is exactly what' b' the amendment protects. this interpretation can be found as far back' b' as the dred scott case, in b'' b" it's worth noting that us vs. miller sustained miller's conviction" b' of possession of an illegal firearm, noting that a sawed-off shotgun' b' was not a proper militia weapon.' b'' b'no, they noted that no one had claimed that it was a proper militia' b'weapon (despite having been used in at least two wars). this was true,' b'since neither miller nor his lawyer appeared before the court.' b'' b"did they or did they not sustain miller's conviction? i don't have the" b'text of the case handy.' b'' b'yes, shotguns had been used in wwi, the spanish-american war, and the' b'us civil war. that was not in question. the possession of a sawed-off' b'shotgun was, i.e., a weapon altered to improve concealibility.' b'' b' therefore, us vs. miller supports limited government regulation of' b' firearms.' b'' b"don't go arguing down this road unless you are willing to abide by" b'the consequences that you find at the end of it mainly, that the' b'law-abiding common man has a right to own any weapon that has a militia' b'purpose, from handguns to sawed-off shotguns and fully automatic weapons.' b'that, in fact, is what this decision says.' b'' b"you are free to produce evidence that i'm not willing to abide with" b'all the implications of this.' b'' b"just because i don't whole-heartedly endorse the nra position does not" b'mean that i oppose the rkba. this attitude is what makes the nra' b'unpopular.' b'' b'--' b'stephen graham'
