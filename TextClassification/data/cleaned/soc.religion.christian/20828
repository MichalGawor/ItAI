b'' b'greetings,' b'' b'probably a tired old horse, but... maybe with a slightly different' b'twist. i wanted to know if there are any good english-language texts' b'for learning ancient hebrew, and how these compare with german' b"educational texts qualitywise, if anybody has an idea. i can't figure" b'out if i should buy one here for later study or wait until i get back to' b'the u.s.' b'' b'something i find interesting about studying theology in germany is the' b'fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the' b"way early [i'm not a theology student, but i spend a lot of time with" b'such folks] in their careers. they take the first two years or so to just' b'do greek and latin and hebrew [possibly aramaic, too--who knows].' b"what's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the states? is" b"there a lot of language instruction done? i really don't have a basis" b'for comparison.' b'' b'regards, phil' b'--' b'philip sells is anything too hard for the lord?' b'' b"[for better of worse, we don't have the tradition of classical" b'education in the u.s., so generally if a seminary believes students' b"should know greek, they have to teach it. it's common for seminaries" b'to require at least a semester each of hebrew and greek, though of' b'course more is required for serious scholarship. --clh]'
