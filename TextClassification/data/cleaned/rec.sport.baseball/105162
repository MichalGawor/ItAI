b'' b"| this week's play:" b'|' b'' b"it took three days to get to us, but i'll try anyway as i naturally" b"haven't seen the answer." b'' b'| with runners at first and second and one out, the batter hits an' b'| easy pop fly to the third baseman.' b'|' b'| (a) the umpires declare the infield fly rule and the third baseman' b'| lets the ball drop. the runner at second heads for third and the' b'| third baseman flips the ball to the short stop who tags the bag' b'| before the runner.' b'' b'safe. the correct call is "infield fly, (batter out) if fair". runners' b'may advance at own risk. (gotta tag up if caught, etc.) it is not a' b'force, and the pop was not caught, so regardless of whether the ss' b"tags 3b or 2b (it wasn't clear, above), he hasn't got the runner out." b'' b"| (b) the umpires don't declare the infield fly rule and the third" b'| baseman allows the ball to drop and throws to the short stop, who' b'| tags the runner from second while the runner is between second and' b'| third.' b'' b'out. see rule 6.05(l) approved ruling. (below). in this case, the' b'umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule' b"doesn't apply. (sounds like a bad call here, but that's not the" b'point). the batter is not out, so a force situation is created.' b'therefore, the runner is out. unless, by rule 6.05(l) the ball is' b'dead and the batter is safe, then i guess the runners would advance' b"unmolested. i can't really tell from 6.05(l) that the ball is dead in" b'this situation.)' b'' b'|' b"| what's the call in (a) and (b)?" b'' b'pertinent rules: definition of infield fly: "when an infield fly' b'is called, runners may advance at their own risk. if on an infield fly' b'rule, the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball, the ball remains' b'in play despite the provisions of rule 6.05(l). the infield fly rule' b'takes precedence."' b'' b'6.05(l) a batter is out when: an infielder intentionally drops a fair' b'fly ball or line drive, with first, first and second, first and thrid,' b'or first,second and third base occupied before two are out. the ball' b'is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base' b'or bases. approved ruling: in this situation, the batter is not out if' b'the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground,' b'except when the infield fly rule applies.' b'' b'--' b'mild-mannered computer scientist --|phone|-- president. pitcher. my knuckler?' b'bell-northern research, ottawa,ont. |booth| not too legit to hit! b'phone: fax: phone:
