b'' b': hello,' b':' b': let me introduce a problem:' b':' b': when i measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using' b': ac mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over squared). right? b': when i measure a square wave in the same mode (ac), my output is equal' b': to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.' b': i assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the' b': input value, and divides it over the wave period. right?/' b': now, i used it to measure the same square wave as above, but distorted' b': by high-frequency harmonics. ideally, output should be the same, but...' b': the output value was only about of the previous one!' b': why? what is the nature of this output value? what does the voltmeter' b': actually measure? and what does it show?' b'' b'' b're: rms readings' b'' b"unless the dvm *says* it's measuring rms, it's probably average voltage." b"the input is diode rectified and measured as dc. if it says it's rms" b"and but measures square/triangle/etc. incorrectly, it's measuring" b"average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves" b'(i.e. vave*(0.707/0.63) vrms). if you want correct rms for (most)' b'any waveform, you need a "true-rms" dvm/dmm which literally does the' b'root-mean-square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.' b'' b':' b': related question (less important to me):' b': what are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with' b': analog ones?' b'' b'the last significant advantage of analog (imo) was being able to' b'"see" the signal if it was changing over time (e.g. checking' b'electrolytic capacitors).' b'' b'anymore, most dmm have bargraphs, etc. that duplicate this.' b'' b':' b': thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at' b': way.' b':' b':' b': alexander v. mamishev' b':' b': b': power system automation laboratory phone office b': department of electrical engineering phone home b': texas a&m university fax b': b':' b'' b'--' b'================================================================================' b'jeff gruszynski' b'semiconductor test equipment' b'systems engineer' b'hewlett-packard' b'================================================================================' b'(415) or t b'================================================================================'
