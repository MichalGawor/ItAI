b'' b'hi, i just have a small question about my bike.' b"being a fairly experienced bmw and mz-mechanic, i just don't know what to" b'think about my honda.' b'she was using too much oil for the last km (on my trip to daytona bike' b'week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and' b'was running only on one cylinder.' b'i towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect' b'working order. no cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look' b'very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. all' b'still within factory specs. the only thing i could find, however, was a' b'slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem),' b'but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the clymer-manual for' b'this bike.' b'any syggestions??? what else could cause my problem??? do i have to hone' b'the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in' b"order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? won't that increase the" b'wear of my pistons??' b'please send comments to' b'thanks in advance. stef.' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'stefan ruhl' b'german exchange student.' b"don't poke into my privacy
