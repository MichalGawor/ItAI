b'' b"my online bible is on a cd, but i don't own a cd-rom system for the" b"time being, so i can't search for the famous cite where jesus explicitly" b"states that he didn't want to break existing (jewish) laws. in other" b'words technically speaking christians should use saturday and not sunday' b'as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of jesus.' b'' b'who said christians want to conform to the teachings of jesus?' b'' b'"you are the light of the world. a city can\'t be hidden lying on a' b'mountaintop. nor do people light a candle and cover it with a big' b'basket; they put it up on a tall candlestick where it can shine for' b"everyone in the house. that's how your light must shine in front of the" b'world, so that people see your good deeds and give credit to your father' b"in the skies. don't think i came to dissolve the law [torah aka first" b"five books] or the prophets: major plus minor] i didn't come to" b'dissolve them, i came to fulfill them. i assure you, till the sky and' b'the earth go away, not one letter or punctuation mark of the law will' b'ever go away until everthing has come to pass. so anyone who dissolves' b'even one of the smallest commandments and teaches others the same way,' b'will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas anyone' b'who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as someone' b'great in the kingdom of the skies." matt5:14-19, gaus, isbn:0-933999-99-2'
