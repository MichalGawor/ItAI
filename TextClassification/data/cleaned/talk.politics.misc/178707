b'' b'' b'' b' a good case? a f**king good case? the defense lawyer asked the victim' b' questions like "what kind of sexual perversions do you participate' b' in?" and you think he made a good case?????' b'' b"speaking as someone who's only about six weeks and a tuition bill" b"away from becoming an unemployed slob with a law degree, i'd really like" b"to see a transcript of this trial. i'd especially like to know what" b'happened immediately after the defense attorney asked that question' b"(assuming that the reports that he did so are accurate... i'm not" b'accusing tom farrell of making anything up, but this _is_ the sort of' b'case that spawns garbled misquotes, false rumors and urban legends like' b"tribbles). it'd be nice to think that the prosecutor objected" b'(irrelevant, prejudicial, inflammatory... take your pick) and that the' b'judge upheld the objection.' b'' b'having watched most of the televised trial, i can answer that' b'when such statements were made by the defense atty, the prosecutor did' b'object, and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously' b'falling under the "self-incrimination" type of objection. there was' b'quite a bit of meta-discussion during the trial over the use of graphic' b'language, with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the' b'exact language. practically every time the defense tried to get the' b'plaintiffs to "self-incriminate" by asking them such questions, there' b'were objections and sustains.' b'' b'at one point the defense managed to get in a quip about' b'"solicitation for a felony" and the judge herself said "sustained"' b'before the prosecutor could get the objection stated.' b'--' b'uucp: ...!duke!wolves!wolfe <standard disclaimers apply' b'above all, we celebrate! --celebrate the circle, statement of purpose.'
