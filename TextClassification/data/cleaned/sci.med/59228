b'' b'' b'do you believe that any quacks exist? how about quack diagnoses? is' b'being a "licensed physician" enough to guarantee that someone is not' b'a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,' b"other people shouldn't say so? can you give an example of a" b'commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,' b'or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer' b'need to worry about unscrupulous "healers" taking advantage of' b'people.' b'' b'' b'i would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of' b'the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the ama before starting' b'any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though "accepted", may' b'not be necessary for the patient at the time. and all for making a quick' b'buck. i would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the u.s. is' b'significantly inflated by these "quacks of a different color". in fact, i\'d' b'say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the' b'true focus of the medical profession. the ama and the boards should focus' b'on these "quacks" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on \'search-and-' b"destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-" b'traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients' b'that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.' b'' b'' b'***************************************************' b'now to make a general comment on many recent posts:' b'***************************************************' b'' b'lately i\'ve seen the word "quack" bandied about recklessly. when a doctor or' b'doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical' b'subject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say "quack-quack" and' b'somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over' b'on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience. what do they teach' b'you in medical school how to throw your authority around?' b'' b'let me put it another way to make my point clear: "quack" is a nebulous word' b'lacking in any precision. its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.' b'the indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency; and coming' b'from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real' b'scary.' b'' b"but what do i know, i've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this" b"newsgroup as being 'anal retentive', and 'psychotic'. i look forward to more" b"net.diagnoses. hey, they're free." b'' b'' b'jon "quacks \'r us" noring' b'' b'' b'(p.s., may i suggest seriously that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on' b'the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and' b'theories, such as the "yeast theory", should create your own moderated group.' b'you can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.ama-approved, so you' b'can keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)' b'' b'--' b'' b'charter member infj club.' b'' b"if you're dying to know what infj means, be brave, e-mail me, i'll send info." b'=============================================================================' b"| jkn international ip fred's gourmet chocolate b"| carlton place phone chips world's best! b'| livermore, ca v-mail: b'=============================================================================' b"who are you? read alt.psychology.personality! that's where the action is."
