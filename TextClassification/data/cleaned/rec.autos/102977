b'' b'i was recently thumbing through the lemon-aid new' b"car guide. what i found was a car would be given a 'recommended'" b'under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a' b'driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed' b'in a front end collision. the most highly recommended small' b'car (the civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small' b"cars listed. there were many such cases of 'great' vehicles" b"where you wouldn't survive an accident. is it only me, or is" b'safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?' b'' b''
