b'' b'' b"we're hearing it. it sure rings true-- it's consistent in a way that" b'mass suicide by fire is not. this survivor is also saying that they' b'were trapped inside by the damage done by the tanks.' b'' b'\twhy is an accidental fire more plausible than a mass suicide,' b'\tconsidering that the davidians were an apocalyptic cult with' b'\ta history of armed violence? if the fbi has reason to lie' b'\tabout the cause of the fire, if it resulted from their own' b'\tnegligence, then the bd survivors also have reason to lie if' b'\tthey started the blaze.' b'' b'the fbi claims the fire was set simultaneously in three places. they' b'claim the building was filled with tear gas. electricity was cut off,' b'tanks were rolling all around. how did the bds co-ordinate the' b'setting of the fire?' b'' b"it's fairly simple. it was decided to burn the place down," b'and more than one agent was dispatched to set the fires in' b'separate parts of the compound. i doubt that "simultaneously"' b'means "at the exact same time" in this case. it likely means' b'"close enough together to preclude them from being part of' b'the same fire."' b'' b'' b"the fbi claims that men with torches set the fires-- but haven't released" b"any evidence of this, though it seems inconcievable that they don't have" b'any if it was true.' b'' b'they might be waiting until the evidence comes in from the' b'site, and the investigation is at least well underway.' b'' b'' b'all of the bds' b'previous actions were aimed towards their survival, not their death.' b'' b'the same could be said of jonestown.' b'' b'the idea that kerosene lamps would be all over the place (with' b'electricity cut off) makes sense. the idea that ramming tanks into' b'the building would spill them and cause a fire makes sense. the' b"possibility that the fbi wouldn't know this is nil. it wasn't simple" b'negligence.' b'' b"maybe. then again, i've been suprised at what folks have missed" b"in the past in similar situations. don't jump t oconclusions." b'' b'_____ b'\\\\\\\\\\\\/ b'mitchell s todd b"\\_____ tamu.edu b"\\__________\\__ b'\\_ b'\\/____/\\\\\\\\\\\\' b'\\\\\\\\\\\\' b'------'
