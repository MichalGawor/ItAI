b'' b'' b'it seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested' b'who is behind the center for polict research. i will oblige.' b'' b'my name is elias davidsson, icelandic citizen, born in palestine. my' b"mother was thrown from germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'" b"(at that times this group was defined as 'jews'). she was forced to go" b'to palestine due to many cynical factors. i have meanwhile settled in' b'iceland years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from' b'my homeland, palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to' b"the 'indesirables'). these people include my neighbors in jerusalem" b'with the children of whom i played as child. their crime: theyare' b'not jews. my conscience does not accept such injustice, period. my' b'work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism' b'and racial discrimination. those who protest against such practices' b'in arab countries have my support as long as their protest is based' b'on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism' b'from israel. the struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.' b'' b'the center for policy research is a name i gave to those activities' b'undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command' b'the support of many volunteers in iceland. it is however not a formal' b'institution and works with minimal funds.' b'' b'professionally i am music teacher and composer. i have published' b'several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in europe.' b'' b'i would hope that discussion about israel/palestine be conducted in' b'a more civilized manner. calling names is not helpful.' b'' b'elias davidsson' b'iceland' b''
