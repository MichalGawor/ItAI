b'' b'did anyone else see this game last night just like a playoff game!!' b'lots of hitting...but i was disappointed by the video goal judge...' b"on all replays, joe murphy's goal shouldn't have counted it didn't go in net" b'!! and according to the tsn broadcasters, the video goal judge said that he' b'saw the water bottle on top of the cage move so he assumed the puck went in!' b"this is terrible...hope crap like this doesn't occur in the playoffs!" b'the game would have ended in tie b'' b'i thought the red light went on...thus, in the review, the presumption' b'would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the' b"net...from the replays i say, even from the rear, the evidence wasn't" b'conclusive that the puck was in or out...in my opinion...' b'' b'gerald'
