b'' b'the cryptographic algorythm must be kept secret, or' b'private individuals could make clipperclones with' b'which they could transmit messages which the feds would not have' b'ready access to.' b'' b"not necessarily. i've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme" b'is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,' b'either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme' b"like diffie-hellman. if there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared" b'session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping? if the phone' b'company or some other online central authority generates a session key and' b"sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of" b'having some complicated key-depositories? just ask the phone company for' b'a copy of the session key for each call.' b'' b"now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of" b'every public key used by anyone anywhere, right? so, probably, there will' b'be some way of getting these keys verified. this might be a digitally-' b'signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,' b'stored by this unit. it might also be an online directory with access to' b"everyone's public keys. (this would introduce another weakness to the" b"security of the scheme, of course.) presumably, if you don't use your" b"designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips." b'' b'it might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to' b'use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair' b'and verification scheme. unfortunately, this would not allow you to call' b'most people and establish secure communications....' b'' b'--john kelsey' b'i hope somebody starts doing this soon after the first' b'ones are released...'
