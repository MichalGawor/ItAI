b'' b'' b'oh, yea, and chris bosio pitched a no-hitter. one over the minimum, two' b'bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, pitches. i listened' b'to the game on radio and listening to dave niehaus call the game was a' b'real treat (as long as they keep ron fairly quite, i doubt if anyone is' b'better than niehaus but that fairly guy is really annoying me).' b'' b'but, i guess if clemens or viola had been pitching, it would have' b'been a different story b'' b'two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in' b'major league baseball pretty impressive in any league.' b'' b'man, if johnson, bosio and hanson keep going the mariners could be a' b'really interesting team to follow this year. also, john cummings (rookie)' b'has had three solid outings with no support. if fleming comes back' b'this may be the best starting staff in the american league this year' b'(relief is another story, though grimace).' b'' b'too cool. the first no-hitter that i have been able to follow from' b'start to end. and again, i think niehaus will win some kind of award' b'for the way he called the game. the guy is truly a joy to listen to b'he deserves a pennant race b'' b'kent dietz' b"twins in b'mariners if only they were an nl team! follow?'
