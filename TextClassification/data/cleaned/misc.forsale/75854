b'' b'********************[ pc game for sale b'' b'waxworks by horrorsoft/accolade (5.25")\t\t b'' b'by the same folks who brought you elvira i ii. i played' b'elvira i ii, and think that horrorsoft has finally made' b'a very playable game with waxworks. the look and feel is' b'roughly the same as in the elvira games, though the real time' b'fighting is a little easier to survive. the first two games,' b'especially elvira ii: jaws of cerberus made it very tough to' b'stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult. this' b'is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is' b'quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found' b'that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting' b'strategy. in one of the four wax works to be explored, there is' b'no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain' b'moderately challanging puzzles.' b'' b'the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really' b'broken up into four seperate rpgs, one for each of the four exhibits' b'you must enter. in starting each one, your character is transported' b'with no objects to use, and experience level one exhibits traps' b'you inside a multi-level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must' b'escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving. another exhibit' b'traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines' b'and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant' b'zombies. this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue' b'some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill' b'the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up. this is' b'perhaps the most horrifying exhibit. another exhibit puts you into' b'jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper' b'victim, and of course the police think you are responsible. you must' b'avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and' b'meet him face to face but first get a disquise. the last exhibit' b'pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to' b'stop the almost indestructible zombies.' b'' b'over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a' b'creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the elvira games, though' b'gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.' b'i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans.' b'' b'*********************************************************' b'' b'- all prices include shipping.' b'- all games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.' b'- us buyers only please.' b'- all games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,' b'priority usps.' b'- all games include all original materials including box, manual,' b'disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.' b'' b'the first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to' b'get the game. those just asking questions get no priority until' b'they offer to buy the game. lower offers may be considered' b'assuming no other offers at asking price are made.' b'' b'**********************************************************' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'sam bauer\t|\thewlett packard co.,' b'(719)-531-4460\t|\tnetwork test division'
