b'' b'i have been using a hds x-terminal, and really like it. what' b'is really powerful is that it can run the x server without' b'running a window manager. one can then run a special client' b'x program called a window manager, either run' b"motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network" b'traffic but having no home). or run motif or openlook' b'from some home place (like a sparc, or vms).' b'' b'this is powerful, especially since i can exit one window manager' b'(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.' b'(some of my vms tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in' b'one manager and not the other).' b'' b'well the question is:' b'' b'on a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to' b'break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? basically i' b'want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run' b'the window manager.' b'' b'---' b'please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the' b'large volumes in window.x)' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'scott moody "there are no answers just cross references"' b'uunet!bcstec!shuksan!scott'
