b'' b' for example: why does the universe exist at all?' b'' b' must there be a "why" to this? i ask because of what you also' b' assume about god-- namely, that he just exists, with no "why"' b' to his existence. so the question is reversed, "why can\'t' b' we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to' b' "just exist"? why must there be a "why" to the universe?"' b'' b'whether there is a "why" or not we have to find it. this is pascal\'s(?) wager.' b'if there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely' b'wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. if there is a why and we' b"don't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives." b'suppose the universe is billion years old, and suppose it lasts another' b'5 billion years. suppose i live to be that is nothing, that is so small' b'that it is scary. so by searching for the "why" along with my friends here' b"on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared." b'' b'what if you woke up at a party, with no memory, and everyone was discussing' b"who the host might be? there might not be a host, you say. i say let's go" b"find him, the party's going to be over sometime, maybe he'll let us stay." b'' b'because we recognize our own mortality we have to find the "why".' b'' b' b' well, then, buddhism, confucianism, taoism, hinduism, judaism,' b' zoerasterism, shintoism, and islam should fit this bit of logic' b' quite nicely... all have depth, all have enduring values,' b' thus all must be true...' b'' b'this is a good point. but more of a good point for studying religion' b'than ignoring it. some christians disagree with me, but it is worthwhile' b'to study different religions and philosophies and glean the truth from' b'them. to quote (of course out of context) "test everything and keep what is' b'true."' b'' b'chris mussack'
