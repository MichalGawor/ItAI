b'' b'| when i was a school boy, my biology teacher told us of an incident' b'| in which a couple were very passionate without actually having' b'| sexual intercourse. somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm' b'| cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation.' b'|' b'| was my biology teacher misinforming us, or do such incidents actually' b'| occur?' b'' b'sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause' b'pregnancy, even in the presence of a hymen. i doubt that sperm could make' b'it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum,' b'but it might be possible.' b'' b'so, it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant.' b'also, some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse' b'without rupturing. the problem when investigating these phenomenae is,' b'of course, getting an honest account of what exactly happened.' b'' b'-philippe'
