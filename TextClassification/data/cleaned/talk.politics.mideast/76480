b'' b'so, mr. salah is still claiming stalin was a jew?' b'' b'this thread began on sca, when he and another guy claimed both stalin' b'and lenin were jews. when i posted evidence from books and the britannica' b'showing they were christians, someone made the (correct) remark that' b"lenin's maternal grandfather was a jew who converted to christianity." b'' b'to counter the fact that stalin was a christian who, during his youth,' b'was trained to be a priest, mr. salah wrote "yes, it says he was trained' b'to be a priest, but not for what religion!" (btw, stalin developed' b'strong antisemitic feelings later in his life).' b'' b'mr. salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against jews by posting' b'antisemitic forgeries and trying to "prove" that certain notorious' b'people were jews, even if they were not.' b'' b'' b'-danny keren.' b''
