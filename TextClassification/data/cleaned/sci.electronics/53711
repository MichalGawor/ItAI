b'' b": as the subject says can i use a for digital signals? i don't see" b": why it couldn't handle digital signals, but i could be wrong. anyone have" b': any advice? thanks.' b'' b'the switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to 1k ohm when' b'powered by volts) and a maximum current and a maximum static' b'voltage across switch. not a good bet for ttl. should work for' b'cmos, but slow things down a bit. there are 74hc versions that' b'have better specs. but lower max voltage.' b'' b''
