b'' b'and of course, mike ramsey was (at one time) the captain in buffalo prior to' b'being traded to pittsburgh. currently, the penguins have former captains' b"and real captain (lemieux) playing for them. they rotate the a's during the" b'season (and even the c while mario was out). even troy loney has worn the c' b'for the pens.' b'' b'' b'i think that mike foligno was the captain of the sabres when he' b"got traded to the leafs. also, wasn't rick vaive the captain of" b'the leafs when he got traded to chicago (with steve thomas for' b'ed olcyzk and someone). speaking of the leafs, i believe that' b'darryl sittler was their captain (he\'d torn the "c" off his' b'jersey but i think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he' b'was traded to the flyers.' b'' b'oh yeah, of course, gretzky was the captain of the oilers before' b"he was traded wasn't he?" b'' b'gary'
