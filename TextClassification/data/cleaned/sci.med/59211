b'' b'okay, this is a long shot.' b'' b'my friend robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very' b"regularly. this has been going on for a number of years. she's seen a" b'number of doctors; six was the last count, i think. most of them have' b'said either "you have mono" or "you\'re full of it; there\'s nothing wrong' b'with you." one has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her,' b'and one has claimed that it is epstein-barr syndrome.' b'' b'now, what she told me about ebs is that very few doctors even believe that' b"it exists. (obviously, this has been her experience.) so, what's the" b'story? is it real? does the medical profession believe it to be real?' b'' b'has anyone had success is treating ebs? or is it just something to live' b'with? thanks for your assistance.' b'' b'joel "the ogre" cherney' b'of the horde'
