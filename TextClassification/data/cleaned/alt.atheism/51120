b'' b' recently, ras have been ordered (and none have resisted or cared about' b' it apparently) to post a religious flyer entitled _the soul scroll: thoughts' b' on religion, spirituality, and matters of the soul_ on the inside of bathroom' b' stall doors. (at my school, the university of new hampshire) it is some sort' b' of newsletter assembled by a hall director somewhere on campus. it poses a' b" question about 'spirituality' each issue, and solicits responses to be" b" included in the next 'issue.' it's all pretty vague. i assume it's put out" b" by a christian, but they're very careful not to mention jesus or the bible." b' i\'ve heard someone defend it, saying "well it doesn\'t support any one religion.' b' so what??? this is a state university, and as a strong supporter of the' b' separation of church and state, i was enraged.' b'' b' what can i do about this?' b'' b"it sounds to me like it's just screaming out for parody. give a copy to your" b"friendly neighbourhood subgenius preacher; with luck, he'll run it through the" b'mental mincer and hand you back an outrageously offensive and gut-bustingly' b'funny parody you can paste over the originals.' b'' b'i can see it now:' b'' b'the stool scroll' b'thoughts on religion, spirituality, and matters of the colon' b'' b'(you can use this text to wipe)' b'' b'' b'mathew'
