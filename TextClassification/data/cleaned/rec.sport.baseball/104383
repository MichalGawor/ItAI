b'' b'just wondering. a friend and i were talking the other day, and' b'we were (for some reason) trying to come up with names of jewish' b"baseball players, past and present. we weren't able to come up" b'with much, except for sandy koufax, (somebody) stankowitz, and' b'' b"it's stankiewicz, not stankowitz, and he's not jewish he's polish" b'(by the way, the correct pronunciation according to stanky himself,' b'is "ston-kev-itch". all the sportscasters get it wrong)' b'' b'maybe john lowenstein. can anyone come up with any more. i know' b'it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this, but' b'humor us. thanks for your help.' b'' b'the only other jewish ballplayer i can think of is ron blomberg, who is' b'best known as being the first dh to appear in a major league ballgame.' b'' b'-alan'
