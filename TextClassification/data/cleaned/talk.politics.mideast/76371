b'' b'' b' b' eh???? could you please give me details about an event where a "neutral' b' observer" was killed by purpose by an israeli soldier?' b' b'' b' there are many cases, but i do not remeber names. the isralis shot and killed' b' a un observer in gaza in the first half of intifada.' b'...' b'' b'not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of count' b'bernadotte, who was _the_ un negotiator during the israeli war of' b'independence. he was killed by the israelis. seems he was being too' b'successful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked' b'territorially against the nascent israel, compared to continued war.' b'--'
