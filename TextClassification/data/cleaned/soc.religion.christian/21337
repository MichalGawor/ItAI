b'' b'' b'i believe that the god has preserved the bible perfectly in that it' b'perfectly conveys all of the truth that he intended. this he has done' b'' b'oh yea? which version of the bible is the perfectly preserved one? and' b'why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved? is' b'god trying to confuse us?' b'' b'minor changes in wording or even accidental omission of passages in some' b'manuscripts does not change the truth being conveyed, nor would it lead a' b'serious student into doctrinal error. (note also that god provided many' b'' b'but that is exactly what happend. there are so many branches of' b'denominations of christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding' b'from varying translations of biblical texts by "serious students" that' b'are much too numerous to begin to count. if there is a perfect bible,' b'then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be' b'no need for anyone here to be debating it. on the other hand, maybe' b'the bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to' b'read it correctly, but then there would be no point in god giving us' b'something we cannot use correctly.' b'' b'in short, if you attack the credibility and reliability of the bible, you' b'are on weak ground. furthermore, the only reason that i can see for wanting' b'to do so is to remove the bible as the final authority, and instead put' b'that responsibility on men to sift the bible to strain out the nuggets of' b'truth that it contains (in other words, what they want to believe), and' b'ignore the rest. the bible is truth; it does not just contain truth.' b'' b'imho, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book,' b'you are on weak ground. remember, in the beginning was the word, and' b'the word was with god, and the word was god. this word existed before' b'the bible was written. (note: word god). this word that john is' b'trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language,' b'all languages being imperfect. realization comes only from contemplation' b'of the word, and is outside the boundaries of language. i use the bible' b'as a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority.' b'god alone is the final authority.' b'--' b'===========================================================================' b'senior software engineer dupont drive, irvine, ca b'procom technology, inc.
