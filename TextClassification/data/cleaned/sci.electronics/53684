b'' b'<lots of pretty good stuff about how the huge towers near most nuclear' b'power plants are there to cool the used steam back into near ambient' b'temperature water deleted' b'' b"water. as i recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many" b'fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive' b'contamination.' b'' b' actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual' b"boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.
