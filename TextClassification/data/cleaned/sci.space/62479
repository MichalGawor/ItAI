b'' b'hello netters,' b'' b"i'm new to this board and i thought this might be the best place" b'for my post. i have a question regarding satellite technology seen' b'in the movie patriot games. in the movies, the cia utilizes its' b'orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in n africa.' b'the photos taken by the sats are stunning! i know that sats are' b'capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles. my' b'question is this: the camp in question was taken out by the' b'british sas. and while the sas was in action, the cia team was' b'watching in the warroom back in langley, va. the action of the sas' b'was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat. the action was at' b'night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type. that is,' b'one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.' b"does such techology exist and what is it's nature? i.e., uv, ir," b'x-ray, etc.' b'' b'ps who wrote the book patriot games?' b'' b'mad vlad'
