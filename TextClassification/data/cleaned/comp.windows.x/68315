b'' b'' b'you are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop! what if you are on an' b'xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine? that is when the' b'load problems occur. if you had a machine with xterminals attached and' b"they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable" b'ethernet bandwidth waste.' b'' b'ethernet certainly has enough bandwidth for a few blinking cursors. my' b'lisp machine blinks the cursor twice a second and updates the time in the' b'status line every second. this uses under 1k bytes/second, or about of' b'the bandwidth of ethernet. a hundred of them on a single ethernet might be' b'a problem, but a couple dozen should be fine.' b'' b"granted it's nothing to loose sleep over, but this is ethernet's tragic flaw:" b'the more activity (especially lots of tiny activity), the more collisions' b'happen and the performance gets exponentially worse... i am just now' b'opposing any kind of waste of bandwidth under ethernet. although in a polling' b'system it would not be so bad.' b'--' b'/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\' b'| mark a. davis lake taylor hospital norfolk, va (804)-461-5001x431 b'\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/'
