(i've got mine set to i've seen numbers from to b'recommended). also check your stacks statement, stacks=9,256 is a good' b"starting point. try increasing it if it's already set there (such as" b'to stacks=12,256, etc.). both stacks and files have been identified as' b'_one_ cause of frequent win3.1 crashes.' b'' b'lamont downs'
