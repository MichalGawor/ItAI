b'' b'i have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings. some say' b'the lead/ mercury leeches into your system and this is bad. and i have' b'recently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding' b'ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.' b'' b'my dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where i have' b'two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both.' b"he says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large." b'so, i would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam' b'and composite. and, should i really even be worried about amalgam? i' b'heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more-' b'is this true.' b'' b'any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated.' b'' b'' b'thanks!' b'' b'dave childs' b''
