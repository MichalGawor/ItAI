b'' b'' b'' b'r&t had an article on cars of the sc1 ilk and they liked the civic ex,' b'the escort gt and the mx-3 best of all, and the sc1 was way down the' b'list except for braking.' b'' b'i just looked at that article; first of all, this summary is inaccurate;' b'of cars, the sc1 was 5th, right behind these mentioned and the suzuki' b'swift as has been pointed out, it was a semi-silly comparison; the' b'saturn was at least cheaper than the mx-3 and escort (admittedly' b'negligible, but an issue), and (!)less than the honda. the stated' b'goal was a base under $12k; the honda was over, while the sc2 at' b'the same price was excluded. in other words, they let the best honda' b'play, but not the best saturn. note that the saturn did beat the $13k' b'' b'i dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest' b'assured that the street prices for the mx-3 and escort and (maybe) even' b"the honda will be lesser than that of the saturn you're talking about." b"all price comparisons i've seen are based on msrp and of course the" b'saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others' b'will do it way below sticker.' b'' b'srihari' b'' b"i'd hate to rehash an old thread, but... would someone kindly quote" b"a prices that a dealer quotes for a civic ex, and escort gt. also, i'm a" b'assuming that the mx-3 was the v-6, so go ahead and look that up, too. if' b"someone has one of those yearly buyers' guides that give a low quote price," b'please quote them, too. then find the the sc1 base price.' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'--' b'******************************neil peart, (c)1981*****************************' b'*"quick to judge, quick to anger, slow to understand, ignorance and prejudice*' b'*and********fear********walk********************hand*********in*********hand"*'
