b'' b'' b'i was worried about someone stealing my oil once also. i finally' b'decided to just have my drain plug welded shut. it works great b'i figure that when i add three or four quarts when the oil light' b"comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than" b'the old wives tale of changing the oil and filter every miles.' b'works for me, i must say.' b'' b'' b'i did the same thing to my drain plug for the same reasons. i was wondering' b'how you filled your crankcase though as i welded my hood shut also out of fear' b'that somebody might steal my air-filter.' b'' b'oh come on, silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and' b'put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole. what do you' b'think all those big air intake things are for on those hot-rod cars?' b"they're just for looks only...little does anyone know, they provide" b'access to the oil-fill hole.' b'' b'well, over where we live, we have problems with vandals stealing' b"people's wheels. those locking nuts didn't stop them. so to be" b'safe and sure, i welded the lug nuts to my wheels together. it' b"works, serious! i haven't had my wheels stolen yet!" b'.'
