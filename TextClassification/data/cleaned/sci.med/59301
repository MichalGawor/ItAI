b'' b'' b'i recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific' b'brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them.' b'' b'the principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in' b"psychology called 'entrainment,' whereby external sensory stimuli" b'influence gross electrical patterns of brain function.' b'' b"they are 'experimental' in that people experiment with them and they" b'are _not_ widely (if at all) used in medicine for therapeutic purposes.' b'given the exception of tens and similar units used for external electrical' b'stimulation, usually for pain relief, not really a light and sound machine.' b'' b'they are _not_ experimental in the sense of a specific medical' b'category to that effect, as with experimental drugs, as the fda does not' b'specifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.' b'' b'i would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful,' b'' b'there are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects' b'for mind machines, other than those relaxation-related effects found with' b'meditation or self-hypnosis as well. reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and' b"subjective so far, so it's hard to generalize about their potential value." b'' b'a pretty good general non-technical introduction to a wide variety' b'of these devices may be found in "would the buddha wear a walkman b'some interesting background material, names of suppliers, and capsule reviews' b'of specific equipment.' b'' b'do these mind machines (aka light and sound machines) work? can they induce' b'alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? what research if' b'any has been done on them? could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer?' b'or are they just another bit of quackery?' b'' b'a more important question might be whether they have enough additional' b"value to be worth investing in.
