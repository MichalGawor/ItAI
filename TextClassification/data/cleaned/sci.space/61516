b'' b'getting wierd again?' b'' b'okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to pluto is to large and to' b'expensive..' b'' b'okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. kind of liek the old' b'mirv principle of old cold war days.' b'basically what i mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for' b'different missions,namely different planets. each probe would be tied in with' b'the mother ship (or earth as the case may be).. this is good when and if we go' b'for mars (the mars mission can act as either mother ship or relay point for the' b'probes.' b'' b'also the mother ship would be powered (if not the mars mission) by a normal' b'propulsion, but also a solar sail (main reason for solar sail race is to see' b'what can be done and autmoated?) the sail would get the probes to were they' b'needed.. i know the asteroid/meteor clouds (and such) might get in the way of a' b'sail??' b'' b'main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send' b'multiple probes/mission/satellites/exploreres to different places and cut' b'costs..' b'the probes could do fly bys or we shall see...' b'' b'==' b''
