b'' b'' b'hmmm. we must assume that generating the unit key u from the serial' b'number n rather than generating it from a randomly selected u1 and u2' b'is an intentional way of assuring a "fail safe" for the government b'u is completedly determined given s1, s2 and n.' b'[...]' b'if s1 and s2 do not change, even if they remain secret i wonder if' b'they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number' b'pairs. b'' b'maybe such pairs suffice to reconstruct s1 and s2? by such a back-' b'door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for' b'the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in' b'one session. this would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the' b"keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of (n,u)" b'pairs with identical s1 and s2. (note that these have to be constant' b'for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they' b"have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)" b'' b"and i was wondering why they'll always do chips in one session b'since the procedure described by ms denning imposes high costs on the' b'production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each,' b'plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular,' b'hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting,' b"divide the sum by there won't be a larger demand not from the" b'private sector anyway.' b'' b'and let me mention one other thought that certainly has occurred to all' b'the notoriously paranoid people in this group before: who is going to' b'verify that _no_ interested party will perform tempest attacks on the' b'vault??' b'' b"where there's so much smoke and mirrors there can't be a nice, honest" b'fire but something really worth hiding b'--' b'"i am psmith."
