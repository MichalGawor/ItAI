b'' b'i am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics' b'and imagery. the user of the widget will be able to specify,' b'when creating it, whether it is to operate in x or gl mode.' b'' b'i have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button' b'presses. they work fine when the widget is in x mode. in gl' b'mode they only work when the widget (my gl/x widget) is a child' b'of a manager. put another way, the translations do not work' b'when the widget is configured in gl mode and is a child of a' b'shell. does anyone know why this is happening?' b'' b'thanks in advance.' b'bruce gendler'
