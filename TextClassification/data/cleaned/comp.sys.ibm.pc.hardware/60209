b'' b'i recently purchased the then current pkg.# 486dx-33 for (but changed' b'to nec 3fgx monitor upgrade). buy this pkg. now for more, you now' b"generally recommended you at least upgrade to the zeos (ctx) monitor for" b'$99 more i believe. whether you also upgrade to the diamond viper video' b'card is your choice. i stayed with the diamond speedstar pro. zeos tech' b'support is really good call after normal business hours to get the' b'fastest access. the hardest part about buying a zeos is the wait till it is' b'delivered once you order you can hardly wait to get it! there are quite a' b'few good mail order houses around lots of bang for buck with zeos.'
