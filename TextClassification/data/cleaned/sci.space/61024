b'' b'why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts. for' b'example, why couldn\'t magellan just be told to go into a "safe"' b'mode and stay bobbing about venus in a low-power-use mode and if' b'maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy' b'gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.' b'' b'it can be, but the problem is a political one, not a technical one.' b'' b'also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode' b'(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not' b'spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft. in order to turn the' b'spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the ops guys will be' b'available, or you need to retrain a new team.' b'' b'having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.' b'many of the operational satellites goddard flies (like the tiros noaa' b'series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.' b'extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode for' b'use in an emergency. in that case, however, the same ops team is still' b'required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is' b'relatively cheap.' b'' b"finally, pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance" b'to stay under control) is also right on the mark. i suggested a spin-' b'stabilized control mode because it would require little power or' b'maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time' b'to time.' b'' b'in the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),' b'but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.' b''
