b'' b'' b'this may be an faq (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but i' b'am getting frustrated and looking for help.' b'' b'i am running win with ndw on a 486sx with meg of memory and a' b'6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my' b'applications are not giving back system resources when i close them.' b'' b'when i load windows i start with about resources available but many' b'of the application programs i run regularly (wpwin vb winqvt' b'2.8, lotus organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when' b'i exit them. after a day or two of work i often find myself down under' b'50% of available resources even when i have no applications other than' b'my shell running.' b'' b'i am aware this is a known problem; what i am looking for are some' b'suggestions of what i might do to mitigate it.' b'' b'1. what software is the culprit? win ndw, my applications? are' b'some modes of win (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at' b'plugging this leak?' b'' b'2. are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?' b'' b'3. do people know of patches or third party software that help with' b'this? seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a' b'great market for a third party memory company like qemm.' b'' b'4. if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak subside? (i was' b'hoping that ndw would have plugged this, but it seems no different' b'than in how it deals with memory and resources.)' b'' b'5. when i am writing vb code are there things i can do to make it less' b'likely my code will eat resources?' b'' b"6. any other suggestions that i don't know enough to ask for" b'specifically?' b'' b'thanks for your help. as this is a common problem and i have seen only' b'a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who' b'would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending' b'me email.' b'' b'danny' b'==========================================================================='
