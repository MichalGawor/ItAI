b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i saw this question posted a week or so ago, but as far as i could tell no' b'answer appeared on the net. what is the good oil on connecting the apple' b'extended keyboard to a powerbook? the earlier questioner wonderd if this would' b'be too much of a load for the pb and as i want to connect just such a beast i' b'am curious.' b'' b"i haven't got a pb yet so i can't rtfm but i assume that a standard keyboard" b'with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet i read mentioned connecting an' b'external keyboard. but is the extended plus mouse pushing it?' b'' b'any help gratefully recieved. i will summarise to the net if necessary.' b'' b'thanks, john collins.' b'' b"p.s. i am thinking of a pb160 but i assume that this would apply to all pb's."
