b'' b": i think most of the problems mainly arose from manager gene mauch's" b': ineptitude in managing the pitching staff. down the stretch, he' b': abused jim bunning, chris short, and robin roberts (i think those' b': are the three) pitching each on only days rest for quite some' b': time. by the time they hit the last weeks of the season,' b': obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm. oh' b': well.' b'' b'roberts was long gone he was probably an oriole in or maybe a' b"colt the 3rd starter was art mahaffey, the previous year's ace." b'dennis bennett was the 4th starter.' b'' b'they were indeed up with to go, but they won their final two' b'games after the horrid 10-loss streak. the final game victory' b"(bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the reds from tying for the" b'title; they and the phils were both game behind the cards, with the' b"giants(?) another game back. the mets couldn't hold an early lead" b'against the cards that final sunday, or there would have been a 3-way' b"tie. too bad they couldn't have saved some of the or so runs they" b'scored on saturday when they crushed st. louis.' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
