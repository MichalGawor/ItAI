b'' b'hello,' b'' b'let me introduce a problem:' b'' b'when i measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using' b'ac mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over squared). right? b'when i measure a square wave in the same mode (ac), my output is equal' b'to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.' b'i assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the' b'input value, and divides it over the wave period. right?/' b'now, i used it to measure the same square wave as above, but distorted' b'by high-frequency harmonics. ideally, output should be the same, but...' b'the output value was only about of the previous one!' b'why? what is the nature of this output value? what does the voltmeter' b'actually measure? and what does it show?' b'' b'related question (less important to me):' b'what are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with' b'analog ones?' b'' b'thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at' b'way.' b'' b'' b'alexander v. mamishev' b'' b'____________________________________________________________________________' b'power system automation laboratory phone office b'department of electrical engineering phone home b'texas a&m university fax b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b''
