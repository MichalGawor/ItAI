b'' b' what is the difference between a "_chemist_" and someone who is taught' b' chemistry at, say, cambridge university?' b'' b" put like this, i can't answer. i was originally pointing out that your" b" attitude _seemed to be_ (i don't know if it really was) that chemists" b' tend to ignore all kinds of effects;' b'' b"when they're not important, yes. all scientists do. otherwise science would" b'never get anywhere.' b'' b' your original posting stated that' b' when doing chemistry, it is common to ignore atomic interactions,' b'' b'hang about not atomic interactions in general. just specific ones which' b'are deemed unimportant. like gravitational interactions between ions, which' b"are so small they're drowned out by electrostatic effects, and so on." b'' b' has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years?' b'' b" perhaps this revolution has yet to reach cambridge (my, now i'll get" b' flamed for sure;-) b'' b'oh, probably. they still make people memorize equations and ir spectra.' b'maybe in a few decades they\'ll discover the revolutionary "data book"' b'technique.' b'' b'' b'bitter and twisted, mathew'
