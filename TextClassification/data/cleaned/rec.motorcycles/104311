b'' b'searched without luck for a faq here. i need a left aspencade' b'mirror and honda wants for it. now if this were another piece' b'of chrome to replace the black plastic that wings come so liberally' b'supplied with i might be able to see that silly price, but a mirror' b'is a piece of safety equipment. the fact that honda clearly places' b'concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough' b'to convince me that this (my third) wing will likely be my last.' b'in the mean time, anyboby have a non-ripoff source for a mirror?'
