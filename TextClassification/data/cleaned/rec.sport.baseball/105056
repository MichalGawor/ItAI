b'' b'last night, boston red sox win its games of games by beating seattle' b'5-2. roger clemson pitch not so dominate. he walked at least man in' b'first inns.' b'' b'be fair. he did walk batters in ip. he also allowed only three' b'hits, none for extra bases. only one run. a pretty good outing, all' b'told.' b'' b'i think that game is must win for red sox in seattle, considering darwin will' b'faced seattle ace randy johnson tonight.' b'' b'there is no such thing as a "must win" game this early in the season.' b'and we can always *hope* that darwin pitches well!' b'' b'cheers,' b'-valentine'
