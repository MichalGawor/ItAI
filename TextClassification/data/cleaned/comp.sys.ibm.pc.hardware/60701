(this assumes you have the weitek v. drivers.' b'you can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of' b'the driver: is version microsoft uses this gimmick,' b'too.)' b'' b'the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules' b'speedy program. this program tests various operations and reports the results' b"in pixels/second. i don't have the numbers for the graphite card, but they" b'were close to half of the ofvlb (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20mhz' b"386, isa, so the numbers aren't really comparable. the following numbers" b'were all obtained using a mhz, air motherboard (umc chipset), with' b'8 mb memory. i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it' b'computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.' b'' b'the speedy benchmark was put out by hercules and iit, who to my' b'knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the' b"hercules graphite/iit agx014 card look really good. so i'd take the" b'numbers with a ton of salt. (texas instruments did the same thing' b'with wintach, trying to make the look good compared to the' b"8514, as if anyone cared.) it's safer (though not safe) to use" b'benchmarks from "unbiased" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,' b'etc.' b'' b'' b'interestingly, the solid' b'vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,' b'filled with cross-hatching) and ternary rops (whatever they are. graphics' b'operations like xors maybe????) are a dead loss on the b'' b"i think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of speedy and" b'the results of anything else in the universe on these things.' b'' b'i give two' b'numbers for the fonts, because i think they are caching.' b'when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly b'1/3 the speed of the ofvlb. then the speed increases dramatically. sounds' b'like programming to a benchmark to me....' b'' b'font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization windows has' b"hooks for it built right into the gdi. what's kind of silly is iit's" b'use of a hardwired "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then' b'sat on a tack" string in their driver. not only is it useless in' b'real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the "bart' b'simpson optimization," in which you save the bitmap of the' b'most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a' b'screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a' b'second time in a row.
