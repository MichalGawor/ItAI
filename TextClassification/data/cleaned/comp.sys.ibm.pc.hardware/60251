b'' b'' b'i have a drive as drive a. how can i make the system boot from' b'my b drive? (optimally, the computer would be able to boot' b'from either a or b, checking them in order for a bootable disk. but' b'if i have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that' b'it can\'t boot disks, that\'s ok. also, boot_b won\'t do the trick' b'for me.)' b'' b'thanks,' b' davebo' b'you can try to get into the setup byt pressing ctrl-alt-ins or' b"ctrl-alt-printscreen on most pc's. that should give you an option" b'to set regarding the drives to boot from.'
