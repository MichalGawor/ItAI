b'' b'' b" that's _five weeks in a balloon_. and if anyone can tell me where to" b"get it, i sure would like a reply! i've been looking for that book for" b'ten year+, and never found it. (note that i am _not_ looking for a b"collector's item; i'm hoping that *someone* has published it in modern" b"times, either in paperback or hardcover. i'm willing to spend or" b'so to get a copy.' b'' b'i too am a jules verne collector, and can tell you that though tough' b'to find, it *is* out there. i keep my eyes open all the time for his' b'books at various bay area used book stores, and every once in a while' b"get *very* lucky. you just need diligence. i don't know if the book" b'store situation near jsc is as good as the bay area, but good luck.' b'i have also had excellent luck at the antiquarian book fair which comes' b'to sf every other year, though the prices are more in the range' b'than the you want to spend. my guess is that *if* you find it,' b"you won't need to spend even that much, since most people don't care" b'about it. i think i paid about for my dust-jacket-less but otherwise' b'good condition copy, which i found one day at a small bookshop that happened' b'to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale.' b'' b'of course, if you re willing to buy blind, you can put a advertisement' b"in the antiquarian bookseller's newsletter (the exact title of which escapes" b'me at the moment.) _five weeks in a balloon_ is not the rarest of jules' b'verne books. someone has it for sale somewhere, and the ab is the way to' b"find it. in fact, i would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers" b'of sale. of course, that takes the fun out of hunting for it yourself...' b'' b'good luck.' b'' b'-scott' b'-------------------- new .sig under construction' b'scott i. chase please be patient'
