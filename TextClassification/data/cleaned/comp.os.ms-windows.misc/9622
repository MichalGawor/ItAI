b'' b'' b'' b'dear friend,' b' the risc means "reduced instruction set computer". the risc usually has' b'small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase' b'the clock rate to have a high performance. you can read some books about' b'computer architecture for more information about risc.' b'' b'hmm... not that i am an authority on risc but i clearly remember' b'reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large.' b'the difference is in addressing modes risc instruction sets are not' b'as orthogonal is cisc.' b'' b'' b'i hope this will clear it up b'' b'(taken from one of my lecture notes)' b'' b'" the alternative approach (to cisc),' b'which has been adopted by many in' b'recent years, has come to be known as "risc": the reduced' b'instruction set computer. this can be characterised simply as' b'"simpler is faster"; by simplifying the design (e.g. by reducing' b'the variety of instructions addressing modes), the hardware can be' b'designed to run faster. even at the cost of needing more' b'instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,' b'faster design.' b'' b'a typical risc processor will:' b'' b'o provide a large number of registers (e.g. b'' b'o perform all data operations on registers;' b'' b"o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register offset');" b'' b'o only allow load store operations to access memory;' b'' b'o only use a few instruction formats;' b'' b'o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).' b'' b'if the odds are a million to one against something occurring, chances' b'are it will.'
