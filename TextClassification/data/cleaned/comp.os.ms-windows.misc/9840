b'' b'a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation. once' b'the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc.' b'' b'unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of spss left: when i run' b'something like "write" and go to embed an object then "spss chart"' b"appears on the list of objects i'm offered. i looked around all" b'the obvious "ini" files without success. the next thing i tried' b'was looking for the string "spss chart" in every file in the' b'windows directory. it turned up in a file called req.dat (or' b"reg.dat). unfortunately the file was binary and so i didn't feel" b'inclined to edit it.' b'' b"i'd welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers." b'' b'chris wooff'
