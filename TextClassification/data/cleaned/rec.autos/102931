b'' b"how do i square this with a respectable resale value? easy- if it's expensive" b" to buy new, it's gonna be expensive to buy used." b'===============================' b'a patently false statement. try this logic on an alfa in fact,' b'marketplace has a wonderufl mechanism to "adjust" the value of the cars that' b'are overpriced by the manufacturer. if it is expensive to buy new it is not' b'necessarily expnesive to buy used. in fact, it could be real cheap to buy' b'used, depending what that car is of course. note that i do not question your' b'statements on the reliability of wrangler. i have never owned one, driven one' b'or been in one (i do love to have one though!).' b'' b'' b"what i don't understand is why" b'this apparent neglect of quality for so many years has not filtered down into' b'the used market.is jeep so intoxicating, so irresistable and so seductive as' b'to make its purchase a fatal attraction?.' b'' b'bijan' b'' b'' b'' b"yep. they are popular vehicles. you don't see a lot of previous model year" b"ones sitting on dealer's lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are" b'out. the things sell, they are popular.' b'' b'because they are popular, and high-priced new, they are high price used, very' b'simple.' b'' b'i knew they were overpriced when i bought it... i knew they had a terrible' b"reliability record when i bought it. but i didn't expect anything like i" b'got, especially with a dealer network unable to repair it. personal experience' b'has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine.' b'' b'dave'
