b'' b'' b'' b' someone please help me. i am searching to find out (as many others may)' b"an absolute 'cure' to removing all detectable traces of marijuana from" b'a persons body. is there a chemical or natural substance that can be' b'ingested or added to urine to make it undetectable in urine analysis.' b'if so where can these substances be found.' b'' b'you could do what i do: never go near the stuff! b'' b'' b'--' b'' b"there's always the old switcheroo." b'' b'my brother works at a dialysis clinic. they were interviewing' b'candidates for a technician job (mainly electronics tech), and a' b'urine screen was part of the interview. the bathroom was across' b'the hall from a lab. one candidate managed to switch his urine' b'sample with one he grabbed from the lab. (no one was in it at' b'the time.)' b'' b'most inner-city dialysis patients have quite a few medical problems,' b'so it was immediately obvious what had happened. my brother' b'fleetingly considered telling the candidate, "i\'m sorry but you' b'are very ill and need medical attention immediately." they offered' b'him another *well-monitored* chance and he declined.'
