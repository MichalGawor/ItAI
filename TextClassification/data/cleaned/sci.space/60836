b'' b'' b"the gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'. these" b'are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a' b'three body system. the probe was launched into this region for the' b'earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to' b'allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow' b"down. the idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without" b'expending fuel, we\'ll just find the trajectory that makes it possible". the' b"originator of the technique said that nasa wasn't interested, but that japan" b"was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for" b'deceleration.' b'' b'' b'i should probably re-post this with another title, so that' b'the guys on the other thread would see that this is a practical' b'use of "temporary orbits..."' b'' b'another possible temporary orbit:' b'' b'--' b'phil fraering |"seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff.' b'' b''
