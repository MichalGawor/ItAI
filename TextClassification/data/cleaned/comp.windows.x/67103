b'' b'dear xperts,' b'' b"i'm developing an application that uses a motif slider to select" b'an image file out of a directory. now i would like to display the' b'name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale' b'button (i.e. with the mb1 pressed). as xmnshowvalue only displays' b'the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding' b'image file name, i thought of using an xtaddeventhandler to do' b'the mapping between the scale value and the file name:' b'' b'xtaddeventhandler(scaleimage,button1motionmask, false, slidermoved, null);' b'' b'' b'and in the eventhandler do a:' b'' b'while (xchecktypedwindowevent (display, event-window, motionnotify, &return))' b';' b'xmscalegetvalue(scaleimage,&value);' b'/*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/' b'' b'' b'however, when i move the pointer in the scale widget i get callbacks, with of co' b'urse' b'a null effect as my mb1 is not pressed to move the scale button. so what is goin' b'g wrong?' b'or is the a wrong approach to this problem?' b'any hints are highly appreciated.' b'---' b'phil'
