b'' b'hi' b'i have an orchid fahrenheit vlb with 2mb of dram. it is an s3' b'86c805 based card. i had a problem for a while after installing my' b'second meg of dram for the video, and thanks to orchid, i got a fix' b'from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the' b'ordinary manual. i assume it would come with memory ordered from' b'them, so i guess i should be glad they didn\'t just say "buy the memory' b'from us" or something like that.)' b'' b'the one thing that i was puzzled by was why there was not a' b'1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or' b'enlarged desktop mode. my ati ultra plus can handle that, given 2mb' b'of memory. all the 2mb buys you on the fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.' b"just one more mode. geez. had i known, i wouldn't have bothered. i" b'asked them why, and all i got was "your point is well taken, but' b'orchid\'s software developers are busy with other projects."' b'' b'so, to get to the point, finally, are there any s3 86c805' b"drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes? i'd love to" b'get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next' b'generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my' b"system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're" b'broken.' b'' b'if you want these modes, steer away from orchids s3 86c805' b'cards (ie. vlb or va/vlb), at least until their developers are "less' b'busy". if the magazines are to believed, i\'ve only seen one s3 86c805' b'product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (genoa?),' b'although evenn that might be a misprint.' b'' b'please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out' b'there, let me know where i can get them. 800x600x32k is ok, but i' b'coulda gotten that with my ati vga wonder xl.' b'' b'thanks.'
