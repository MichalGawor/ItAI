b'' b"or the cultists...) i think i'll quote the bbc quoting (actually voice" b'interview) one of the two british survivors. he claimed that the fire' b'started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall/roof to collapse' b'knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan.' b'' b'\tif the fbi started the fire, why didn`t people flee the' b'burning building?' b'' b'in this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire. the davidians' b'would have burned no matter what, especially if the batf/fbi set the' b'fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to vernon howell and' b'therefore rocket to heaven. a few comments from the remaining' b'davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this' b'theory (one cult member said that she wished that she had been there,' b'and that now she would have to wait for vernon to return for them. she' b'actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them).' b'' b'while i think that vernon started the fire (his followers anyway),' b'it is incidental to their reaction.' b'' b'--' b'<<<<<<<<<< personal opinions? why, b'<<<<<<<<<< they were?.......
