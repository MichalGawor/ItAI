b'' b'' b'can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run' b"digital speech down 14.4k? i think it is; i've heard it's not. lets" b'say bit samples. would *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate' b'be usable? if not, how fancy does the compression need to be?' b'' b'note: i am *not* a cable freak, so i might have completely' b'misunderstood what you said. also, my math is frequently noted for' b"being wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself." b'' b'i assume that 14.4k means 14.4k bits. so if we assume one start and' b'one stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes' b'per second is 1.44k.' b'' b"let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in" b'stereo, so that you can send samples/sec. this corresponds to a' b'nyquist frequency of hz, which should be too low, especially if' b'you think about the 8-bit low quality sound. furthermore, your d/a' b'converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been' b'cut off at hz, but will instead alias in all the higher' b'frequencies. (although you can definitely build a filter to overcome' b'that problem.)' b'' b'on the other hand, speech should be easily compressible. for example,' b'you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and' b"then linearize the fourier transforms. it won't be cd quality sound," b"but it'll be discernible. the power spectrum method is very good in" b'that respect. i have once programmed such a software compressor, and' b'compression rates of with relative errors due to linearization of' b'less than were common. although i must say that these were musical' b'sounds, not speech.' b'' b'have fun.' b'' b'--' b'sig closed for inventory. please leave your pickaxe outside.' b'pgp public key available on request. note the expiration date.'
