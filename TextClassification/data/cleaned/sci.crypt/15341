b'' b'' b'i know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard' b'of clipper was in the friday morning newspaper! and another has' b'already fired off a letter of protest to nist.' b'' b'my point? i suspect this list, interesting as it is for various' b'reasons, does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together.' b'some of them, yes. others, no.' b'' b'i received mail from mitch kapor saying that he did not ask to be on' b"the list, and does not know why he was added. i'm sure the same" b'applies to others on the list. so, i guess my initial theory was' b"right, that the clipper list was just someone's idea of a bad joke. i" b"guess i should be happy it wasn't a conspiracy." b'' b'marc' b'--'
