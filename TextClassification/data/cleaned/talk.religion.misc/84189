b'' b'question for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists (stephen' b"tice, the cotera, joe gaut, et al)(apologies if i've mislabelled any" b"of you, i've only started reading t.r.m since the bd disaster. but i" b'know the cotera is a fundy) and are defending koresh and his beliefs' b'as an example of true christianity under persecution from the the big' b'bad secular state: what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits?' b'if the reports are accurate, what iyo does this say about the quality of' b'his christianity? or are the allegations just part of the big' b'cover-up?' b'' b"(i remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: i wouldn't" b'put it past koresh to have torched the place himself. on the other' b"hand, if the propane-tank-accident story is correct, i wouldn't put it" b'past the fbi to try to cover its ass by claiming koresh did it. i' b'hope your government does a very thorough investigation of the whole' b"debacle, and i'll be disappointed if a few heads don't roll. the" b'authorities seem to have botched the original raid, and in the matter' b'of the fire, are guilty of either serious misjudgement, or reckless' b'endangerment.)' b'--' b'| this-opinion my.opinion; assert (this-opinion carletonu.opinion); b'"somebody touched me making everything new burned through my life like a' b'bolt from the blue somebody touched me i know it was you" bruce cockburn'
