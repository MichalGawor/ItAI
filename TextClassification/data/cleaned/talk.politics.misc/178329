b'' b'' b'' b'... the point is that this law protects no one but the' b'established car dealers or people with enough money to start a' b'fairly big operation all at once. protecting these folks from' b'competition protects the rest of us from low prices and high' b'quality.' b'' b' an excellent point. but you seem to be missing a more subtle' b' point. it is not "the government" that should be the recipient' b' of your displeasure, but the established business interests' b' that influence and direct government action in this case.' b'' b'it is the government that is preventing entry to the market. the' b'desire of those running established businesses to prevent or' b'restrict the entry of competitors is an understandable, though' b'generally unpleasant, human failing. but without a means to act' b'on this desire, without a government with sufficient power to' b'restrict the options of the potential competitor, the' b'anti-competitive desire remains just an unpleasant wish. the' b'government is the linchpin, so we seek to disengage it so we' b"don't get the shaft." b'' b"once again, mark, you don't specify the means through which the government" b'is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests. as a' b"left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, i'm just as willing as" b'you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto' b'dealers.' b'' b"but what i hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms," b'to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,' b"and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay. each strikes me as a" b'particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special' b'interests cannot influence public policy. in fact, they seem clearly' b'designed to accomplish the opposite.' b'' b'jsh' b'' b'=mark' b'--' b'"one thing about data, it sure does cut| uucp: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh' b'the bulls**t." r. hofferbert ma bell:
