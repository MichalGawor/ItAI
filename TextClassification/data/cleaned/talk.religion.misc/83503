b'' b'the observation that the tree of life would rotate clockwise in the' b"northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't" b'give enough consideration to the feebleness of the coriolis force compared' b'to, say, the phototropism of vegetation. a much more likely explanation' b'is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the sun-wheel, because' b"the sun progresses across the sky that way. (although that's not the" b'historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation' b"images of the sun moving thru the heavens. so it's more valid to talk of" b'the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me? of course' b'not.) anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the' b'anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents evil, or' b"because it is the sun's twin-opposite, the moonwheel. the use of anti-sun" b'to represent evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,' b"but i'm not going to try to settle that one just now."
