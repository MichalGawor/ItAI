b'' b'' b'just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. top three' b'contenders seem to be at&t paradyne, zyxel, and us robotics. zyxel has the' b'biggest "cult following", and can be had for under but i ignored it' b'because i need something with mac software, which will work without any' b'tweaking.' b'' b'you shouldn\'t have ignored the zyxel. it can be purchased with a "mac' b'bundle", which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and faxstf software.' b'the bundle adds between and to the price of the modem, depending' b'on the supplier. it is true that the modem has no mac-specific docs,' b"but it doesn't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting &d0 in the" b'init string, to enable hardware handshaking).' b'' b'for more information on the zyxel, including sources, look at various files' b'on sumex-aim.stanford.edu, in info-mac/report.' b'' b'disclaimer: i have no affiliation with zyxel, though i did buy a zyxel' b'a u1496e modem.'
