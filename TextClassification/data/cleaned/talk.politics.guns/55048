b'' b"okay, here is the result of my efforts. i'm just getting started with this" b'type of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low.' b'' b'comments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.' b'' b'****************************************************************************' b'' b'editor,' b'' b'i would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to' b'the "right to keep and bear arms", and to a greater degree, the many other' b'"rights" that we take for granted on a daily basis.' b'' b"1.\tyou're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house. you" b'call the police. how will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while' b'you are waiting for the police to arive?' b'' b'2.\tyou are driving your family home when your car breaks down. a "good' b'samaritan" stops to "help", when you find you and your family at gun-point or' b'knife-point. how will you defend yourself? and your family?' b'' b'3.\tyou are a woman walking alone to your car or home. a man appears' b'suddenly with the intent to rape you. how will you defend yourself? are you' b'strong enough to fight off your attacker? are you willing to let this man rape' b'you in order to survive the attack?' b'' b'if the house and senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep' b'and bear arms, as provided by the second amendment to the constitution. a gun' b'may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going' b'to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to' b'defend yourself and your family?' b'' b'many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun. if' b'certain members of the house and senate have their way, and 9mm' b'ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law' b'enforcement departments. very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition' b'for use in your handgun.' b'' b'there is already a day waiting period in california. do you really feel' b'that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for' b'the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?' b'' b'our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,' b'or in a moments notice. you should have the right to protect yourself while' b'waiting for help to arrive.' b'' b'there is currently legislation circulating in washington that would prohibit' b'the sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns. one' b'elected official even wants to repeal the second amendment!' b'' b'i want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected' b'officials decided that they should only belong to a "certain church", or go to' b'church on a "partiular day"? what if you were told that you could only read' b'certain books? write about certain subjects? what if you no longer had the' b'right to a jury of your peers? how about the right to assemble in a peaceful' b'manner?' b'' b'these are all rights that are provided by our constitution and the amendments.' b'if we give up one right, we may as well give them all up. if you do not fight' b'for the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for? when your life' b'is affected? write your law makers now! protect all of your rights by' b'defending your second amendment rights.' b''
