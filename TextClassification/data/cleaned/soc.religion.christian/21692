b'' b'ever since i was a kid and learned to tell when i was in a' b'dream i have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems.' b'in my dreams i have done everything from yell at my mom' b'to machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual' b'fantasies. i have deliberately done things that i would never' b'do in real life. i understand the need to control ones' b'thoughts, but i always felt that dreams were format free,' b'no morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes i would' b'have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.)' b'' b'is this an incorrect attitude? rather than weakening my inhibitions,' b'i could argue that i got certain things "out of my system" by' b'experiencing them in dreams. by analyzing a dream i can determine' b'if i have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream' b'something will be exagerated that i can then contemplate and' b'see if it really bothers me or not.' b'' b"i can't believe that other people don't do the same. it seems" b'silly to attach moral significance to dreams.' b'' b'i think that this is entirely different from out of body' b'experiences, which i have never had.' b'' b'contradictions welcome.' b'' b'chris mussack'
