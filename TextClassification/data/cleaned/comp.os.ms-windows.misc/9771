b'' b'' b"i've been reading, with much confusion, about whether or not to use" b"atmanager. lately, all the packages i've been buying have all" b'included atmanager as a "bonus"' b'i do some desktop publishing using pagemaker and coreldraw.' b'coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over diff' b'types. add that to the ttfonts that come with win31 and you have a' b'decent amount of fonts. i print my creations out on an hp4' b'postcript, at dpi resolution with the "resolution enhancement' b'technology" and well i get some darn good copies.' b"so good that there isn't any diff whether or not atmanager is turned" b'on or not. is it worth it to run atm at all? especially with these' b'better printer technologies and tt?' b'' b'atm will do nothing for your truetype fonts. if your truetype fonts are' b"sufficient for your needs, don't run atm. i have a lot of fonts that i can" b'install either as type-1 postscript (under atm) or as truetype. i have' b'noticed that:' b'' b'1.\ttruetype font files are at least larger than their type-1' b'equivalents. if you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware' b'that truetype fonts will compress, whereas type-1 fonts will not' b'(they are encrypted).' b'' b'2.\twith a dpi laser printer, the "artificial bold" version of a' b'truetype font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to' b'install the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if i want' b'to use them. type-1 postscript fonts under atm generate a visually' b'distinct bold variant from the base font. i realize that the' b'artificial bold font that atm generates is aesthetically inferior' b'to the hand-generated bold truetype variant, but it is sufficient' b'for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me b'on disk space (uncompressed).' b'' b'--' b'bob nichols' b'at&t bell laboratories'
