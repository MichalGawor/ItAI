b'' b'' b'well, spenz...what can i say? b"you've attacked my beloved vehicle! b'' b'if i may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you' b'love vehicles or the use they are put to. i, myself, think the f-86 is' b"a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, i wouldn't even think of flying" b'it in combat today. most of us want access to space and judge vehicles' b'on how they perform.' b'' b'we see "zero-defects operation" in many area|s of life.' b'' b'not to this degree.' b'' b'calling shuttle flight characteristics *bizarre* in the same post' b'as touting dc-x is interesting.' b'' b'why?' b'' b'dc-x will also have similar "zero-defects" issues (am i wrong?).' b'' b'your wrong. the dc approach is very tollerent of failure. it also has' b'the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (shuttle' b"isn't reusable, it's salvagable)." b'' b'i am thinking of how dc-x will deploy a chute or reverse orientation at' b'supersonic speeds.' b'' b'the flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. if the dc-x' b'shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.' b'' b"how much in dc-x is redundant? that's the real question." b'' b'the final dc-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight' b'envelop. upon re-entry for example, it can loose about of available' b'thrust and still land safely.' b'' b'everything we do in life has zero-defects issues at times (agree?).' b'' b"everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same" b"thing. shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, ssto is." b'' b'as a doctor, i can not error in my diagnosis and treatment recommendations.' b'' b"you don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. you" b"wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for" b'harmful side effects would you?' b'' b"while dc-x's r&d program makes good sense, i am less optimistic about dc-x" b'as you (and apparently others) are.' b'' b'you are very much in the minority. if the dc series fails to make orbit, it' b'will still be a very worthwhile effort. it will show us exactly what we do' b'need to do to build ssto.' b'' b'but, dc-x will still have failures. it is the nature of aerospace r&d.' b'' b'again, refering to the dc-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout' b"the flight envelop. shuttle doesn't. dc is fault tollerent, shuttle isn't." b'' b"it's successors are not slated to be passenger carrying." b'' b'not true. build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will' b'carry passengers.' b'' b'the impression i had' b"when i visited macdac huntington beach's open house was that the payload space" b'was limited and the man-ratable version was decades away.' b'' b'i would suggest you talk to the dc-x crew themselves. their original' b'schedule had an operational dc-1 flying in b'' b'shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences' b'and medical related packages. as for now, it is our only ticket into space' b'and has my support.' b'' b'your ignoring the dammage it does. mannes space has a reputation for being' b'unreliable and hugely expensive. shuttle supporters only make it easy for' b'opponents of manned space to kill it.' b'' b'you could change my view on dc-x if you could prove the following:' b'' b'the only way to prove those things is to build it.' b'' b'allen' b'' b'--' b'+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+' b'| lady astor: "sir, if you were my husband i would poison your coffee!" b'| w. churchill: "madam, if you were my wife, i would drink it." b'+----------------------35 days to first flight of dcx-----------------------+'
