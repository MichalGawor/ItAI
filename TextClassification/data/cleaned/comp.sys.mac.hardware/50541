b'' b"here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped" b'myself and a few others:' b'' b'what does an external ram cache card do for you if you already have a large' b'cache set (through control panel) in your simms?' b'' b"ex: i have a mac iici with meg ram, an external video card (so i don't" b"rob my simm's), and the default apple cache card (i believe this is 32k?)." b'say i have my cache set at meg, what good does a measly 32k do me on the' b'cache card? could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache' b"between the card and the simm's? or does it still speed things up by" b"providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into" b'the simm ram cache?' b'' b"i'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to" b'really do any good compared to what you can set yourself. yet, daystar' b'fastcache has numbers which show around a performance boost on some' b'operations. are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most simm' b'accesses?' b'' b"please help, i'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the iici" b'system described in the ex above.' b'' b'--patrick'
