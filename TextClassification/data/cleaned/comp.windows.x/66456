b'' b"i'm writing 'xwall', a simple x version of 'wall', and i want it to" b'put a message up on each of a default list of displays. the problem' b'is that xopendisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently' b'controlled by xdm (login screen).' b'' b"xdm does xgrabserver when it's running in secure mode (so do some" b"screen-locks). there's really no simple way to tell this is the case." b'' b'you can take xdm out of secure mode; probably not too cool.' b'' b'you can wrap your call to xopendisplay in some code which solicts' b'a future sigalrm and longjmps past the xopendisplay from the signal' b'handler. an example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.' b'' b'note that longjmping out of xopendisplay probably causes a memory' b'leak; any program functioning this way probably needs to exit()' b'regularly.'
