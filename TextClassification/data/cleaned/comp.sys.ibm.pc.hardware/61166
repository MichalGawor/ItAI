b'' b'\ti am right now working on an mpr-ii certified (swedish standards for' b"low emissions) hitachi superscan monitor. it's 1024x768, up to 72hz at" b'that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (feb.?)' b'issue of pc magazine. as far as i know, very little fully matches a nec in' b"image quality (at least according to the mags i can't tell any" b'difference between the two!), but i think nec is low emissions on only one' b"of the two types. there's vlf (very low frequency) and elf (i think that's" b'extremely low frequency). the mpr-ii standards set strict limits on both.' b'but many comapnies, nec included according to one article i read (i get a' b'bunch of mags so it\'s hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low' b'emissions" but not specifically "mpr-ii compliant" or "mpr-ii certified"' b'only control for one, usually vlf, and ignore the other.' b'' b"nanao's f-series (e.g. f550i) and t-series (e.g. t660i) monitors" b'are mpr-ii compliant. according to my little pamphlet, the t-series' b'monitors are also tco-compliant, whatever that is.' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'mike yang silicon graphics, inc.'
