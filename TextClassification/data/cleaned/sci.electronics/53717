b'' b' i just installed a motorola xc68882rc50 fpu in an amiga a2630 board mhz' b' with capability to clock the fpu separately). previously' b' a mc68882rc25 was installed and everything was working perfectly. now the' b' systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for' b' the presence/type of fpu. when i reinstall an mc68882rc25 the system works' b' fine, but with the xc68882 even at mhz it does not work. the designer' b' of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe ohm)' b" might help, but that didn't change anything. does anybody have some" b' suggestions what i could do? does this look like a cpu-fpu communications' b' problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?' b' moreover, the place i bought it from is sending me an xc68882rc33. i thought' b' that the 68882rc33 were labeled mc not xc (for not finalized mask design).' b' are there any mc68882rc33?' b'' b'i, too, have a xc68882rc50 math coprocessor, which i installed' b'succesfully in my mega midget racer (clocked at mhz). i have tried' b'clocking my fpu at to mhz and it all worked just fine. i have a' b"mc68030-33 cpu. i don't know why my fpu has an xc (my original 33mhz fpu" b'was label mc68882-33), but it seems to work fine on my system. maybe you' b'just have a bad chip.' b'' b'stefan' b'' b'p.s. or does it mean experimental chip instead of motorola chip?
