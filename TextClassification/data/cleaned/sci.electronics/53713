b'' b'hi there,' b'i have a mac with a burned out part which looks like a voltage' b'regulator. the part number is bu and i believe the vender is' b'sgs thomas judging by teh sgs logo printed on the package. if anyone' b'has teh spec for this part i would greatly appreciate an email with' b'the import info so i can find a replacement. thanx in advance.' b'' b'-dave' b'' b"btw i don't need people telling me to throw the computer away. if" b'i had the money the thing would be in the trash in a second, but' b'it does make a good terminal if nothing else.'
