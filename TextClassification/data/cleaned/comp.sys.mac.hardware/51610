b'' b' \tits not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a' b' vertical position. if the drive is formatted in a horizontal position,' b'it can' b' not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical' b'position.' b" i'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or months from" b'now, but' b' why take that chance? if you want more detailed info on the problem,' b'please' b'' b'' b'sunny,' b'' b'i asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my on' b"it's side. i received a response from someone at seagate (sorry i" b'trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (seagates at the' b'least) can very well compensate for gravity. this means that a' b'horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data' b'integrity problems. the only way that newer drives cannot work is if you' b"have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on" b"it's side on a rocking chair what constitutes a 'newer' drive i" b"don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer. i have a quantum lp240s" b"internal, and since i got it a month ago, i am guessing it's 'newer'." b'' b'-t'
