b'' b'this came up because i decided to configure up mit-magic-cookie-1 security' b'for x11r5. for this to work you need to stick some bits that an intruder' b"can't guess in a file (readable only by you) which x client applications" b'read. they pass the bits back to the server when they want to establish a' b'connection.' b'' b'...' b'what i settled on was grabbing a bunch of traffic off the network.' b'basically, i ran' b'' b'\tetherfind -u -x greater 0|compress' b'' b'and skipped over 10k of output, then grabbed my bits. as best i can tell,' b'these are bits that can be expected to be reasonably uniformly distributed,' b'and quite unguessable by an intruder.' b'' b'for your application, what you can do is to encrypt the real-time clock' b'value with a secret key.'
