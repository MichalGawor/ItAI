b'' b'a friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has' b'emphysema. his lung capacity has decreased over time. his father died' b'of the disease. he works in woodworking. i believe he has a very' b'occasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less. he tells' b"me this..i've never seen him light up. he has some pretty healthy" b'life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy' b'etc. anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up. i know really' b'nothing about the disease. i believe it interferes with the lining' b'of the lung being able to exchange oxygen.' b'' b'is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence? if he were to give up smoking' b'entirely would that better his chances for recovery? what are some' b'modern therapies used in people with this disease? i would appreciate'
