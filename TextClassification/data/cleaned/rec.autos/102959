b'' b'it did it again. this morning, my ford ranger was idling at rpm.' b'ok, so i exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast. it has a b'liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would' b"cause the idle to drop back to normal (i don't think the linkage is stuck)." b'what can i do to fix this problem? this has been a problem from time to' b"time, but has straightened itself out until now. i don't have a tach," b'but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast' b'as it should be. this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up' b'at a stop light.' b'' b'many thanks for any suggestions.' b'' b'- les' b'' b'--' b"les bartel\t\t\ti'm going to live forever" b'intergraph corporation\t\t... or die trying' b'electronics division' b'(205)
