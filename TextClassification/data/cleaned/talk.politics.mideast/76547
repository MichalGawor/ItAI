b'' b'' b'there are basically three alternatives for gaza:' b'' b'what is this "gaza"? are you purposely separating it from the "west bank"?' b'if so, why separate the people and territories? if not, why are you just' b'addressing "gaza" here?' b'' b'1. to throw the jews to the sea. that is basically to make them leave' b' the middle-east and go back to where they came from (russia, europe,' b' usa, etc)' b'' b'by all means, continue to list the "etc." the reason i particularly' b'bring this up here is that there are **many** from middle eastern' b'and west asian countries. that fact in itself **adds** an important' b'element to any consideration of "resolution" of the arab-israel' b'conflict.' b'' b"2. to throw the gazans into the sea, in accordance with yitzhak rabin's" b' wish and that of many zionists.' b'' b'you explained what "sea" meant with regard to the israelis/jews,' b'please do so in this case.' b'' b'3. for israelis and palestinians to come to an honorable and fair (i' b" don't attempt to say just) settlement," b'' b'"just"? you better not ask for that because that would mean north' b'american tribes would be returned their lands, the pre-islamic tribes' b'would take back their lands from the islamic invaders, the saxons get' b'to kick the normans out of the uk, the central and south american' b'tribes get to kick the spanish descendents out of thier lands.....' b'and, once we have returned the land to those who last possessed it,' b'we have to find out from whom **they** stole it. at some point, *every*' b'culture stole the land they are on from previous occupants.' b'' b' which would allow each person to live in dignity in his country in' b' freedom and equality.' b'' b'but wait! now you refer to "palestinians", so what happened to "gaza"?' b'' b'i personnaly opt for the third alternative. how about you folks b'' b'as we both know, most people would choose the third alternative. and,' b'since you have done so in the past, perhaps you would initiate things by' b'presenting your vision of "resolution". in doing so, however, the worries' b'(not paranioas, *worries*) and resonable expectations **of both**' b'parties should be considered.' b'' b'elias' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'tim clock ph.d./graduate student' b'uci tel#: department of politics and society' b'fax#: university of california irvine' b'home tel#: irvine, ca
