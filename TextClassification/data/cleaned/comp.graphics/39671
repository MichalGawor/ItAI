b'' b'' b'hello' b'i have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a' b'moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. this i appreciated very' b'much i would however like to know why it is that ther is simply no' b'information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics' b'programmer. the subjects are' b'' b'1) how do you access the extra video memory on a video board. i' b'know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to' b'dothis. i have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books' b'and info i have read i am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. there is a' b'way to do this in standard vga cause i have seen vidoe paging (written in' b"assembly, which i don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. to get" b'any speed at all you have to do this. how do i do it?' b'' b'2) the vesa standard. what gives here. i have read most of what' b'the net has to offer on vesa and as far as coding for vesa goes most of' b'the advice is cryptic at best. where do i get public domain info that will' b'tell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work.' b'' b'my biggest gripe is about number i have bought graphics books,' b'i have asked graphics professors, i have hunted the net through both' b'gopher, and archie, i ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is' b'some lock on this information. graphics programming books tell alot of' b'programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling' b'you how to really control the video bios. what are all the calls folks, i' b'know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. where' b"are you, and why haven't you written a book yet?" b'' b'please help' b'' b'thanks in advance' b'' b'stephen palm' b'(please send all personal replies to the above address, thanks)' b''
