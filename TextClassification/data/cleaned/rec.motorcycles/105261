b'' b'after failing my state of new hampshire noise gestapo test with my hd' b'slash cut pipes i installed my new bubs (which i had been planning to' b'do anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no' b'problem at about db.' b'' b'two points:' b'' b"first, i don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly." b'holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and' b'doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced' b'the db level! so if any other nh riders need to get this done, make' b'sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from' b'the body.' b'' b'second, these bub pipes are bloody terrific. at low revs or cruising' b'through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats' b'a more throaty, purring, rumble. when you open her up to rpm' b'they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. best of both worlds!' b'' b"russ hughes fxstc dod# 6022(10e20)" b'"the chrome and steel she rides.....collidin\' with the very air she' b'breathes..."' b'-- n. young'
