b'' b' my solution was to switch the interrupt to irq which is' b' unreserved in contemporary computers (using irq for the' b' drives went out with the xt architechture b'' b'not completly true. for at class and later machines, irq5 is' b"reserved for lpt2. since it's rare to have a second parallel" b"port in a pc, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an" b'interrupt.' b'' b'on the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here' b'at work on a gateway computer (4dx-33v). it has a modem on com1,' b'a mouse on com2, and the other serial port was set to com3 (which' b'normally uses the same interrupt as com1). we had a real fight' b'with a board when trying to use irq5, and discoverd the problem' b'was that gateway had set it up such that com3 used irq5. as soon' b'as we disabled com3, our problems went away. grumble after' b"several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work." b'' b''
