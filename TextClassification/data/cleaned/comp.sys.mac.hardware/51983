b'' b'hi,' b'' b'i have been told by a local sales that asante has come out with this' b'lciii pds ethernet adapter with an optional socket on the board.' b'my question is will the fpu performance degrade will i put the b'on the pds card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? intuitively,' b'the math co-processor should always be placed close to the cpu, but' b"i am not sure how good apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when" b'it comes to throughout. does anyone know the answer to this or have' b'any experience with the asante lciii ethernet adapter? thanks in advance.' b'' b'andy' b'--' b'computing coordinator ontario, canada. m5s 1a4' b'department of industrial engineering phone: b'university of toronto fax: b'' b'i believe the fpu on the lciii is always supposed to go on the logic' b'board, not in the pds board. i have heard of crashing problems with' b'pds-based fpus on the lciii. asante may have fixed them but why' b'bother. why bother building an lciii card with an fpu anyway? the' b'extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. i say fpu on' b'main logic board, in socket, ethernet alone on pds card, in slot.' b'' b'' b'mark'
