b'' b'it seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the cyrix compatible' b"486dlc and 486dru2. my info comes directly from cyrix's fast fax service:" b'and also from installing one of these chips in an ibm model b'' b'the 486dlc is a instruction set compatible cpu which fits into a 386dx' b'socket (pin grid array, or pga). the dlc currently is available in speeds.' b'the the and the they do not have a coprocessor on board, but any' b'software query will return coproc as present. i guess they emulate the' b'coproc instructions. math functions are on the 386dx level without the' b'actual coprocessor.' b'' b'the internal cache on the 486dlc is 1k. cyrix literature claims a hit' b'rate. my informal tests show that the cache accounts for a performance' b'boost when it is enabled by software. overall performance boost from a' b'386dx-25 to a 486dlc-25 is about the benchmarks i used were nu si and' b'qaplus dhrystones and whetstones. the performance, with the cache enabled,' b'is about on a par with my 386dx-40 with 256k external cpu cache, which is' b'around the performance for a 486sx-25. the computer runs noticebly faster,' b'and dos with dblspace is not complaining. the company claims os/2' b"compatibility, but i didn't test it." b'' b'the 486dru2 is not a chip, as commonly thought. the 486dru2 is actually' b'a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386dx, which contains' b'the logic to manage the clock doubler. this board plugs into the 386dx' b'pga, and the 486dlc-33 or plugs into this board. i guess the board' b'doubles the frequency apparent to the cpu, and insert wait states when' b'access to the rest of the system is required. there are no info available' b'from cyrix there. anyway, the dru2 is available for 386dx-16, and 386dx-20' b'only. double these clock rates, and you get the 32mhz and the 40mhz dlcs.' b'if cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the dru2-50, then they need' b'to put out the 50mhz dlc2 first...' b'' b'i also tested a dlc33 motherboard, along with a cyrix coprocessor. with 64k' b'external cache, performance were about faster than the but still' b'significantly slower than an actual intel 486dx.' b'' b"imho, the dlc is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or" b"can't install, a new motherboard. it is definitely worth what i paid for it," b"but if you need 486dx-33 performance, the dlc33 won't cut it. i'm not sure" b"about the dlc-40, but i think even if it matches the performance, it won't" b'beat it in any significant way.' b'' b'the last time i posted info about the dlc, people sent quite a bit of mail,' b'asking where i got it. so here is where i got mine:' b'' b'treasure chest peripherals, they advertise in the computer shopper.' b'1-800-677-9781' b'the 486dlc-25 kit was b'' b'but....' b'' b'i liked the chip so much that i found the supplier, and became a dealer.' b'if you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and i can fax or mail you' b"more info. i'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use," b'so i can;t post anymore info here. however, if there are more questions' b"regarding the 486dlc itself, i'll post what i can." b'' b'jamesc' b'909-396-0408' b'' b'' b'--' b'=========================================' b'if someone asks if you are a god, you say... yes!'
