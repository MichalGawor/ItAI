b'' b"intro to access.bus (re: the access.bus software creator's" b'contest announcement)' b'' b'what is access.bus?' b'' b'access.bus is a new open industry standard for computer' b'peripheral connectivity. access.bus is a serial protocol that' b'uses simple, low-cost i2c technology to link multiple devices to' b'a single pc port. peripheral devices such as keyboards or' b'keypads, locators (mice, trackballs, joysticks), printers, vr' b'gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and' b'others can be easily daisy chained to the host pc. applications' b'such as cad/cam, data acquisition, simulation, virtual reality,' b'multiple-player/single pc games, education and many, many more' b'can now take advantage of access.bus, the technology that puts' b'plug and play on every pc.' b'' b'the access.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of' b'systems and peripherals. multiple devices connect to the host' b'computer with only one port. common communication methods for a' b'number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software' b'development. as an open standard, access.bus enables cross-' b'platform use of the same device.' b'' b'access.bus technological description:' b'=====================================' b'' b'access.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone' b'to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without' b'fee or royalty.' b'access.bus has a bus topology architecture. that is, a single' b'host can accommodate up to peripheral devices. access.bus' b'data rate is kbits/sec.' b'' b'access.bus physical layer' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'access.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on i2c hardware' b'protocol, with one data line and one clock line.' b'standard low-cost i2c microcontrollers handle bit-level' b'handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock' b'synchronization.' b'' b'access.bus software protocols' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'the access.bus communication protocol is composed of three' b'levels: i2c protocol, base protocol, and application protocol.' b'' b'i2c protocol: this simple and efficient protocol defines' b'arbitration among contending masters without losing data. i2c' b'provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with' b'different clock rates. bus transactions include addressing,' b'framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the' b'receiver.' b'' b'base protocol: establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between' b'a host computer and multiple peripherals. the host becomes the' b'access.bus manager. the base protocol defines the format of an' b'access.bus message envelope, which is an i2c bus transaction with' b'additional semantics, including checksum.' b'unique features of the base protocol are auto-addressing and hot' b'plugging. auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus' b'addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches. hot' b'plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the' b'system is running, without rebooting.' b'' b'application protocol: this is the highest level of the access.bus' b'protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular' b'types of devices. each type requires a different application' b'protocol. three broad device types have been identified:' b'keyboards, locators, and text devices.' b'' b'access.bus support on the pc' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'all three levels of the access.bus protocol are supported on the' b'pc. an add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the' b'base protocol to communicate with physical access.bus devices.' b'an access.bus manager tsr under dos and a dll under windows b'- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with' b'the access.bus device drivers. drivers are available for' b'multiple access.bus keyboards, locators and printers for dos and' b'windows also available are c language source code examples' b'of the interface from applications to the device drivers.' b'' b'' b'to contact abig (the access.bus industry group):' b'------------------------------------------------' b'postal address:' b'370 altair way, suite sunnyvale, ca b'fax: b'voice: b''
