b'' b" i really don't want to waste time in" b' here to do battle about the legalization of drugs. if you really want to, we' b' can get into it and prove just how idiotic that idea is!' b'' b" read: i do not know what the fuck i'm talking about, and am" b'not eager to make a fool of myself.' b'' b"oh, you foolish person. i do know what the fuck i'm talking about" b'and will gladly demonstrate for such ignorants as yourself if you' b'wish.' b'' b'the legalization of drugs will provide few if any of the benefits' b'so highly taunted by its proponents: safer, cheaper drugs along' b'with revenues from taxes on those drugs; reduced crime and reduced' b'organized crime specifically; etc, etc' b'' b"ahhh, the classic truth by blatant assertion technique. too bad it's" b'so demonstrably false. take a look at great britain sometime for a' b'nice history on drug criminalization. the evidence there shows that' b'during periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crime' b'went up and people did die from bad drugs. during times when drugs' b'were legalized, those trends were reversed.' b'' b'' b'if you would like to prove how clueless you are, we can get into' b"why again a lot of wasted posts that i don't think this group" b'was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little' b'research.' b'' b"now this is a great example of an ironclad proof. gosh, i'm convinced." b'( for the humor impaired). first, assert something for which you' b'have no evidence, then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know' b"what this group was intended for. as to research, if you'd done any" b"at all, you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that" b'legalizing drugs will have many benefits to society. there are some' b"plausible arguments against it, too, but they aren't enough to convince" b"me that criminalization of drugs is the answer. i'm willing to be" b"convinced i'm wrong, but i seriously doubt the likes of you can do it." b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'...dale cook "any town having more churches than bars has a serious' b'social problem." ---edward abbey' b"the opinions are mine only (i.e., they are not my employer's)" b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------'
