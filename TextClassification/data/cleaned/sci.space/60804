b'' b'i was reading popular science this morning and was surprised by an ad in' b'the back. i know that a lot of the ads in the back of ps are fringe' b'science or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention.' b'it was from a company name "personal missle, inc." or something like that.' b'' b"anyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to in length" b'and engines of sizes "f" to "m". they also said that some rockets will' b'reach feet.' b'' b'now, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one' b"of these beasts, isn't this illegal? i can't imagine the faa allowing" b'people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes.' b'not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.' b'' b"and no, i'm not going to even think of buying one. i'm not that crazy." b'' b'' b'-paul "mine\'ll do feet and carries pounds of dynamite" dokas' b'--' b'#include <std.disclaimer' b'#define full_name "paul dokas"' b'/* just remember, you *will* die someday.
