b'' b'| what i *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that' b'| we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the' b'| crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.' b'' b'it should have been made fairly clear that the *most* crimson would' b'ever get was a old style) mhz cpu upgrade. certainly this' b'was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being' b'likely. if our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either' b'confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the' b'chain inside sgi was misleading them.' b'' b"| i'm also annoyed about being sold *several* personal irises at a" b'| previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around' b'| for a while, rather than being flushed.' b'' b'there were versions although admittedly the came' b'out at the same time as the over a period of years. the' b"chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further. i'd say years was" b'a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and' b'age. getting the to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the' b'hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our' b'minds to push it further, and i *know* that was made clear, almost' b'from the day the started shipping. we had one last kicker in' b'the form of the elan graphics, which made graphics versions over' b'its lifespan, which i also think is pretty good.' b'' b'| now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to' b'| keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that i found myself' b'| pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books' b"| just before the end of the quarter), but i'm just a little tired of" b'| getting boned in the process.' b'' b'please, by all means send a complaint letter through sgi support' b'or sales on your concerns. there should be no reason for sales folks' b'to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there' b'will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,' b"but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you" b'are referring to).' b'' b"yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters," b'but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result' b'in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into' b"systems that aren't what they need, i'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*" b'you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)' b'' b"| maybe it's because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies, so we" b'| aren\'t entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the big kids (nasa,' b'| for instance) are. this lab, and i suspect that a lot of other labs' b'' b"they don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly" b'they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions' b'may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the' b"industry. we can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we" b"won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we" b"don't have some niche products, like reality engine)." b'' b"| and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers" b"| every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis." b'| the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the' b'| entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond. that' b'| means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i' b'| have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one' b"| previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other" b"| vendor. i'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years." b"| and every time i look at it, i'm going to think about sgi and how i" b"| could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're" b'| supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars).' b'' b"but surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year" b'period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year' b"period? that's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience" b'(with workstations/microcomputers). supported, and parts available,' b'yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!' b'' b"| now you'll have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a" b'| corner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.' b'' b'i missed your first posting, but as i say, by all means share your' b'frustation with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might' b"have an effect (not immediate, i'm sure, but complaints aren't" b'going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we' b'hear similar things from more than one person/site).' b'' b"all of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not sgi's." b'--' b'let no one tell me that silence gives consent, dave olson' b'because whoever is silent dissents. silicon graphics, inc.' b'ps: i start my sabbatical may, ask those questions now
