b'' b'this is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:' b'' b'' b'' b'i am attempting to add a working savescreen function to a new' b'server. i have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through' b'debugging i can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0,' b'which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.' b'' b'my problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even' b'after i have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys. my question is: what am' b'i likely to be missing that would cause this problem? i copied the basic' b'design of my function from the existing versions:' b'' b'static bool next_savescreen(scr,on)' b'screenptr scr;' b'bool on;' b'{' b'' b'/* this was copied from the omron server code is it the right way? b'if (on screen_saver_on) b'nextsetlasteventtime();' b'}' b'' b"if (on screen_saver_on) save user's current setting b'next_save_screen_brightness nxscreenbrightness(my_eventhandle);' b'nxsetscreenbrightness( my_eventhandle, blank the screen b'}' b'else {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t unblank the screen b'nxsetscreenbrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);' b'}' b'' b'return true;' b'}' b'' b'i can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the' b'saver, but i cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the' b'screen.' b'' b'any tips/help would be appreciated.' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'' b'--' b'douglas scott b'center for computer music research and composition' b'university of california, santa barbara'
