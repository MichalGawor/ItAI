b'' b'' b'i must finally admit the total truth that is central to the' b'core of my being.' b'' b'i am a homosexual. not just a normal, run-of-the-mill' b'homosexual, but a rabid homosexual zionist. i hide behind the' b'facade of pro-israel rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my' b'true motive: the exchange of romantic dialogue with nick steel,' b'and our frequent fudge-packing adventures, which we have' b'endeavored to maintain at a discreet level. of course, the need' b'for discretion has been obviated by my own admission here.' b'' b'the truth is that i could no longer hold this saccharine' b'secret any longer. i love you, nick, and my love for you' b'surpasses that which i hold for eretz yisrael, may she stand' b'forever, as our love has, and as your erection insinuating itself' b'into my kosher rectum always will.' b'' b'' b'=mark='
