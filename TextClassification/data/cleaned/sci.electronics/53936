b'' b'i had a catalog with membrane keypads, but i dunno what' b'happened to it, and it was so long ago that i forget the' b'name of the company. anyway, you could make your own' b'legend and slip it behind the bezel. really nice and' b'reasonably priced. can anyone tell me where to get some' b"more of these critters? i've tried several places, but" b'none of them seem to have keypads which allow you to use' b'your own legend.' b'' b'any suggestion would be appreciated.' b'' b'--' b'larry d. pyeatt the views expressed here are not' b'voice that i know of with the possible' b'exception of myself.'
