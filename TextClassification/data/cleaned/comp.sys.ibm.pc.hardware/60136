b'' b'to following up my own note:' b': b': it looks like everything works as advertised but i am disappointed' b": with the speed. i'm using an intel internal 14.4k modem in the pc" b': with telebit 14.4k on the unix end, which are currently limited to' b': 19.2kbits by the unix com link. to get a quantitative comparison, i' b': did \'cat file\' where "file" is kbyte uncompressed ascii text, and' b': it took seconds to scroll through an x window over the modem link,' b': chars/sec. using the identical hardware and procomm+fw the same' b': "cat file\' takes seconds, chars/sec. btw, i use ncd pc xview' b': on my pc at work (hp) every day for the same unix access from a pc over' b": a lan and like that just fine. the same 'cat file' scrolls by in" b': seconds on the lan connection.' b'' b"i just tried a few experiments. i cat'd a 20261-byte file lines)" b'under various scenarios:' b'' b'pc-xview for dos in a full-screen os/2 window (1024x768x16): sec' b'telix (dos) in an os/2 window (1024xs768x256): sec!' b'telix (dos) is a full-screen os/2 window (standard vga): sec' b'telix (dos) in a windows window (1024x768x256): sec' b'uw/win in a seamless os/2 window (1024x768x256): gave up after min!' b'uw/win in windows (1024x768x256): faster, but gave up after min' b'uw/win in a seamless os/2 window using pg sec, could have been a' b'little faster (i had to keep' b'hitting the space bar)' b'' b'i was using an ati wonder xl video card, by the way.' b'' b'so pc-xview for dos looks pretty good (and the line-by-line scrolling' b'in os/2 desktop looks pathetic, although full-page redraws are pretty' b'good).' b'' b'i tried it under pc-xview using my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font,' b'and with a very small font, and there was no difference in the times.' b'the modem receive light was on pretty solidly, so it looks like the' b'bottleneck was the 9600-baud modem, not the screen drawing.' b'' b'--' b'isg technologies inc. airport rd., mississauga ont. canada l4v 1s7'
