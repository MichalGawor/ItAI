b'' b'recently while looking around in traders sporting goods store, a very well' b'stocked firearms store, i discovered a printed document that was being' b'distributed by the good folks who work there. traders, btw, is located in' b'san leandro, ca.' b'' b'granted, the document may be asking you and i to help out traders, but in the' b'big scope of things, i feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping' b'to this cause.' b'' b'anyway, here it is:' b'' b'newspaper ad censorship' b'' b"are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life, what's good for" b"you, what's not, and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their" b'advertisments?' b'' b'the newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads which is why you no longer' b'see the ads that traders, san leandro, has run for many years.' b'' b'these ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for' b'sporting use or self-protection. they certainly have the right to do so, under' b'the second amendment right to bear arms.' b'' b'if you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to' b'run legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your' b'displeasure over their censorship doctrine.' b'' b"following is a list of bay area newspapers who censor gun ads. perhaps you'd" b'like to send them your thoughts on this issue!' b'' b'oakland tribune\t\tdaily review\t\talameda times-star' b'pob 28883\t\tpob 5050\t\t1516 oak st.' b'oakland, ca 94604\thayward,94540\talameda, ca b'' b'argus\t\t\ttri valley herald\tsan leandro times' b'3850 decoto rd.\t\tpob 10367\t\t161 w. juana ave.' b'fremont, ca 94555\tpleasanton, ca 94588\tsan leandro, ca b'' b'contra costa times\tsan mateo times\t\tsan francisco chronicle' b'pob 5088\t\tpob 5400\t\t901 mission st.' b'walnut creek, ca 94596\tsan mateo, ca 94402\tsan francisco, ca b'' b'san fran. independent\tsan fran. examiner\tsan jose mercury news' b'1201 evans ave\t\t110 5th st.\t\t750 ridder park dr.' b'san fran., ca 94124\tsan fran., ca 94103\tsan jose, ca b'' b'then there are six pages of "facts". i can not validate these facts, and' b'there were no sources, but many feel and sound very true. here are the topic' b'headlines:' b'' b'- big media snow job' b'- blaming firearms for murder is like blaming hospitals for death' b'- i could use the same nazi journalistic technique of cbs and abc to prove' b'that hospitals cause death' b'- how nbc, cbs, and abc have scammed the american people on "gun control"' b'- american tv journalism is based on nazi journalism' b'- why tv journalists lie' b'- the government with the help of the tv networks, has succeeded in playing' b'one group against the other' b'- gun laws are unconstitutional' b'- american gun laws are based on nazi gun laws' b'- the government is trying to devide and conquer' b'- the cia wants your firearms' b'' b'and so on for six pages.' b'' b'so now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying' b'to limit their exposure to potential customers, and preventing the customers' b'from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting, hunting, or' b'other recreational use.' b'' b'let me know if you write to any of these bozos.' b'' b'/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\' b'' b'' b'| oakland bay tracon b'' b'|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|' b'' b'| cbr600f2 pilot nra member ccx1380f s&w magnum carrier b'' b'\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------/' b'' b'' b''
