b'' b'' b'well folks, i currently have a yeast infection. i am male.' b"[...] your best bet (or at least your husband's)" b'is to treat and cure your infection before any intercourse. if you must, use' b'a condom. also, consider other forms of sexual release (ie. handjobs) until' b'you are cured.' b'' b"though i can't imagine wanting to have intercourse during a full-blown" b'yeast infection chances of it being transmitted to the male are quite' b"low, especially if he's circumcised. but it can happen." b'at one point i was getting recurrent yeast infections and the dr suspected' b'my boyfriend might have gotten it from me and be reinfecting me. the' b'prescription was interesting. for each day of the medication (a week) i' b'was to insert the medication, then to have intercourse. the resulting' b'action would help the medicine be spread around in me better, and would' b'simultaneously treat him.' b''
