b'' b'' b' no. a "dragless" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel' b' constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if*' b' there was no drag.' b'' b'well, almost. it turns out that clever orbital mechanics can' b'engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order' b"harmonics of the earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a" b'satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of' b'months to years.' b'' b'my favorite example of this is the soviet/russian heavy elint' b'satellites of the cosmos class, which are in resonance. in' b'particular, c1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in' b'altitude, the current one having started in june the mean altitude' b'of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on b'march (looking at the elements for c1833 also shows the' b"limitations of norad's software but that's another story.)" b'' b'this probably has little relevance to space stations, since the b'degree orbits of the c1603 satellites are at km, which is' b'unacceptably far into the inner van allen belt for manned platforms. but' b"it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the" b'situation.' b'' b'(orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)' b'' b'' b'allen thomson saic mclean, va' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------' b"is there an opinion here? if so, it's mine, not saic's" b''
