b'' b'' b'' b'and to add further fuel to the flame war, i read about years ago that' b'the "natural" msg extracted from the sources you mention above does not' b'cause the reported aftereffects; it\'s only that nasty "artificial" msg b'extracted from coal tar or whatever that causes chinese restaurant' b'syndrome. i find this pretty hard to believe; has anyone else heard it?' b'' b'msg is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. if it is' b'pure, the source should not be a problem. your comment suggests that' b'impurities may be the cause.' b'my experience of msg effects (as part of a double blind study) was that the' b'pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects.' b'' b'i was under the (possibly incorrect) assumption that most of the msg on' b'our foods was made from processing sugar beets. is this not true? are' b'there other sources of msg?' b'' b'soya bean, fermented cheeses, mushrooms all contain msg.' b'' b'i am one of those folx who react, sometimes strongly, to msg. however,' b'i also react strongly to sodium chloride (table salt) in excess. each' b'causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat' b'and an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest, upper left quadrant.' b'' b'the symptoms i had were numbness of jaw muscles in the first instance' b'followed by the arms then the legs, headache, lethargy and unable to keep' b'awake. i think it may well affect people differently.'
