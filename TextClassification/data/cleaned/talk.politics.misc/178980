b'' b'i believe the mow plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy, and' b'basing their count on those. i see two problems with this. one, can they' b"get *everybody* to take one (and only one)? two, they couldn't possibly have" b"been able to choose a color/design that won't clash with *somebody's* outfit!" b'' b"...and three. the ads i've seen for the wristbands indicate they're" b"charging a wristband. as i've seen them, the wristbands look like" b'clear plastic with multi-coloured "rainbow" threads in them labeled' b'"1993 march on washington (the being your particular' b'wristband number).' b'' b'certainly not *everyone* at the march on washington will be willing to' b'shell out five bucks for a piece of plastic.' b'' b'' b'i bought mine at the mow storefront.' b'its not plastic, its woven material.' b'' b'but i think you miss the point.' b'its not about the five bucks in your pocket, its about supporting the' b'march and helping to pay for all the printed materail and scehdulkes and' b'organisation and...' b'' b'all leading up to the literal *birth* of queer visibility in this country.' b'' b'up to this point all our news coverage has been driven by events thatb' b'happen to us.' b'this event is happening by our direct action.' b'of course the last mow was the same thing but they ignored us.' b'i guess that was just labor pains.' b'perhaps they will ignore us again, in which case we will come in' b'even largeer numbers next time.' b'' b'lst night in dc there were so many queers out and about you could hardly get' b'in any place.' b'i suspect thatb over the next two days that will become exponentially' b'larger.' b'' b'to my mind this is a physical bsuting down of the collective closet of' b'queer invisibility.' b'' b'the five bucks is insignificant.' b'' b'lux owen' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'[ eu-phoria: a state of well being b'euphoria is my natural state, i do what i enjoy and an abundance' b'of all good fortune comes to me for it.'
