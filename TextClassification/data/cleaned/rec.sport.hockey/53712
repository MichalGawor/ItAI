b'' b'date: wed, apr gmt' b'' b"selanne's leads the jets; teppo numminen is who do you think" b'is better defensively? ron francis of the penguins is although he' b'has points, while jaromir jagr has only points but is is' b'jagr really better on defense than francis? and how exactly should we' b'interpret the fact that mario lemieux has by far the highest in' b'the league? does he get the selke as well as the ross?' b'' b'the plus/minus does not measure defense alone. it attempts to measure' b"a player's total contribution to the team effort. and certainly, it" b'is far from perfect and my posting never implied otherwise. all that' b'my posting suggested was that the was a better indicator of a' b"player's effectiveness, when examined in the context of that player's" b"team's performance, than mere scoring totals alone. and as for mario" b'getting the selke why not? after doug gilmour, i would rather have' b'lemieux on the ice in any situation (other than as an enforcer, obvi-' b'ously) than any player in the game. i used to call the selke the "bob' b'gainey award". it came about as a result of the statement made by' b'anatoli tarasov: "bob gainey is the best hockey player in the world."' b'i am sure that tarasov was either misquoted, originally, or had a tiny' b'bit too much vodka and was toying with a reporter. in any event, the' b'nhl decided to honour one dimensional checkers along with one dimen-' b'sional scorers. maybe the league should start awarding the "doug gil-' b'mour award" anually to the league\'s most effective, all-round player.' b'' b'cordially, as always,' b'' b'rm' b'' b'--' b'roger maynard' b'' b'hey, what about the "roger maynard award" for the most' b'annoying fan....?' b'========================================================' b'derrick m. jewlal' b'34 laurel st. apt. b'waterloo' b'747
