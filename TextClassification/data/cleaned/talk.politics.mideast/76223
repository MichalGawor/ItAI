b'' b'' b' the comparison of the palestinian situation with the holocaust' b' is insulting and completely false. any person making such a rude' b' and false comparison is either ignorant of the holocaust, or also' b' ignorant of the situation in the mideast, or is an anti-semite.' b'' b' to compare a complicated political situation with the genocide' b' of jews is racist in and of itself.' b'' b'first of all i never said the holocaust. i said before the' b"holocaust. i'm not ignorant of the holocaust and know more" b'about nazi germany than most people (maybe including you).' b'what i resent is ignorant statements that call people' b'names when they disagree with your position. opposing the' b'atrocities commited by the israeli governement hardly qualifies' b'as anti-semitism. if you think name calling is a valid form of' b'argument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more' b'often.' b"i don't think the suffering of some jews during wwii" b'justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government. any' b'attempt to call civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is' b'not appreciated.'
