b'' b'' b'the point that i forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with g' b'bein' b'a gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in s' b'thi' b'area (or in the state of illinois for that matter).' b'' b'right it nas nothing to do with whther or not the person' b"is/was a gang member, but that's what kratz inferred...." b'' b'wrong there are people who can legally carry concealed in il and' b'there are circumstances under which many people can carry concealed.' b'' b'is accuracy really too much to expect?' b'' b'-andy' b'--' b"no it's not. if you would have read my other post i was accurate. here's what" b'i said:' b'' b'[material from another post]------------------------- the other point that i' b"would like to make because i know it's true (looked this one up in the illinois" b'this is for you andy----- b'statutes before) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in illinois.' b'^^^^^^^^ also for you andy.' b'' b'and then i went on to say:' b'there is no such thing as a ccw for us ordinary folk here.' b'[end of quoted material]' b'' b'of course i forgot to mention who "us ordinary folk" are so just for andy i\'m' b'going to go to the library tomorrow and photocopy the part of the illinois' b'statutes with this information and post it. ordinary citizens can not get a' b'license to carry a concealed weapon. there are very few people who can. i' b'even asked my lawyer friend about this and he told me that only certain people' b"can get licenses for concealed carry. he couldn't remember which people but he" b"knew for sure that regular citizens couldn't get that type of license. he told" b"me to go check at the library for the statutes which i did. i'll post that" b'info tomorrow night. until then.......' b'' b'jason'
