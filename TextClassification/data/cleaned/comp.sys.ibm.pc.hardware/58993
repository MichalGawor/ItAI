b'' b'so, by going mailorder through gateway, i save plus, i get' b'technical support over the phone, free software package.' b'' b'have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone. at least' b'locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong, and' b'he has to fix it.' b'^^^' b'how long does he have to take in fixing it? does he have to use new' b'parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your' b'knowledge? can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty' b'but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part?' b'' b'when it comes to local dealers:' b'' b'- have fun getting consistently good support. most of their "techs" are' b're-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.' b'' b'- have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.' b'' b'- have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done' b'period, unless you are on a paid service contract.' b'' b'having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a' b'computerland franchise and another retail computer place, i know what' b"i'm talking about." b'' b'i also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers like' b"to push when they're selling. it's that same old song that car dealers" b'having been singing for years "buy from me and you\'ll get good' b'service. we always treat our customers right! buy from my competition' b'and you\'ll be sorry if you need service."' b'' b'experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order' b'companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts,' b'on-site calls, etc. there are probably some local dealers that can give you' b'good service, too. but if you think all local dealers give consistenly good' b'service, you are wrong. i have many anectdotes to prove my point,' b"but i'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than i can." b''
