b'' b'w/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant. the lockup only' b'occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve mpg. mind you,' b'a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving mpg, but the additional' b'mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration (vs. locked' b'converter clutch) than its inherent losses take away.' b'' b'the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions.. i get much' b'stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup.. which i can induce' b'by briefly lifting off, then quickly (but not too quickly to trigger' b'a kickdown) applying throttle. above rpms, the convertor will never' b'unlock; it would kickdown first.' b'' b"who says there's no skill involved in driving an automatic? i think" b'of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal. with' b'my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my' b'right foot, while having both hands to steer.' b'' b'' b'eliot'
