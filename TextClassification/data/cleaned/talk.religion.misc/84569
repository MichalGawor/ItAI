b'' b'' b'' b'the danger of anti-cult groups is that while they can expose a lot of' b'deception, they can also become inquisitors. as one who agrees with' b'much of what they say, i am also on the receiving end, and it makes me' b'realize the importance of respecting the freedom of belief of every' b'individual and also of not jumping to conclusions and making accusations' b'based on a priori assumptions about an individual or group.' b'' b'for my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are' b'every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large' b'they have no compunctions about printing lies, half-truths and' b'misleading innuendos as part of their exposes. a recent book on' b'cults i picked up by a "christian" author quite simply mixed in' b'all non-christian religions (except the jews) and various new age' b'groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality.' b'' b'on the other hand, the watchman fellowship does a good service in' b'exposing deceptive practices that are far too common among the' b'groups they monitor.' b'' b'given the record of american christianity, any group that falls' b'into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically' b'into the inquisition business. it is an unavoidable affliction' b'of those who have a proprietary license on the truth (tm).' b"and let's not forget that jonestown and the branch davidians are" b'just as much a part of the christian tradition as the missouri synod' b'lutherans, and may in fact be the massadas of true christian believers.' b'' b'i am far more concerned about the encroachment of overtly christian' b'indoctrination into public schools than i am about yoga classes there.' b'' b'for those concerned with religious freedom without a selective' b'inquisitiorial bent:' b'' b'people for the american way' b'p.o. box b'washington, dc b'' b'americans united for separation of church state' b'8120 fenton street' b'silver spring, md b'' b'jack carroll'
