b'' b'' b" the question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for" b"certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a church" b"meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... what are some guidelines? should i just" b'pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (xl), or should i' b'maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely' b'passenger?' b'' b'if your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a' b'crash, have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size. if your' b'primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws, carry a real big' b'spare (you can put a big or small head in a big helmet, but not in a' b'small one).' b'' b'while shopping for a passenger helmet, i noticed that in many cases the' b'external dimensions of the helmets were the same from s through xl. the' b'difference was the amount of inside padding.' b'' b'my solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner' b'from a sheet of closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside' b'surface). the result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion' b'with the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with' b'the liner out. everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'michael robinson uucp: ucbvax!cogsci!robinson'
