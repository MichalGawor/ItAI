b'' b'they way i want it to. however, i have the following problem: my chin hangs' b'out from the bottom of the helmet. i am curious to know whether i would still' b'have this problem if i were to switch to the extra large size? in particular,' b'can anyone tell me "for certain", if the outer shell of the "arai quantum-s" in' b'size x-large is any different (larger-rounder-etc.) than the same helmet in size' b"large? or if the inner padding/foam on the x-large is such that one's head" b"fits a little deeper in the helmet, and thus one's chin would not stick out?" b'this is true for the very old arthur-fulmer helmets that i have. namely, my' b'chin hangs out a little from the bottom of the large helmet, and not at all' b'from the x-large (but the x-large is not as snug as the large). the dealer' b'is willing to replace the helmet at no additional cost (i.e. shipping), but' b'i want to make sure that the x-large is in fact a little bigger or linered' b'such that my chin will not hang out and how much looser will my head fit in' b'the x-large? if anyone has recent experience with this helmet, please let me' b'hear (e-mail) from you asap. thank you so much. amir-' b'' b"i'm not sure about the helmet but for chin questions you might" b'want to write to a:' b'' b'jay leno' b'c/o tonight show' b'burbank calif.' b'' b'good luck.' b'' b'================================================================================' b"steatopygias's 'r' us. doh#0000000005 that ain't no hottentot." b"sesquipedalian's 'r' us. zx-10. ama#669373 dod#564. there ain't no more." b'================================================================================'
