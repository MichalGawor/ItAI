b'' b'' b'from what i understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive' b'device much like the radio in your car. they work as an antenna picking' b'up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out. therefore there would' b'be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of' b'detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.' b'' b'from my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet' b'circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving' b'a fixed intermediate frequency (if) that is more easily amplified. the' b'detector detectors work by picking up if re-radiated from your radar' b'detector. in britain, where one has/used to pay for a tv licence, there' b"are/were tv detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't" b'paid their licence fee. they had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the' b'roof, and i believe could triangulate an operating tv from the if.' b'' b'i wonder how much of the if is radiated back from the detector antenna, and' b'how much from the rest of the module. it might be worth putting the detector' b'in a proper rf shielded enclosure.' b'' b'--'
