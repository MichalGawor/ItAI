b'' b'' b'read issue of wired magazine. it has a long article on the "hype" of' b"3do. i've noticed that every article talks with the designers and how" b'"great" it is, but never show any pictures of the output (or at least' b'pictures that one can understand)' b'' b'gamepro magazine published pictures a few months ago and computer chronicles' b'(a program that is syndicated to public tv stations around the nation) spent' b'several minutes on it when it was shown at ces. it was very impressive what' b'it can do in real time.' b'' b'john munsch' b'' b'the april edition of mix magazine carries a story on 3do which' b"includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some" b'indication from the people at 3do as to where they intend to go and in' b'what stages. (mix is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound' b'engineering community.)' b'' b'the schematic shows a central dma engine connecting and mediating between' b'two graphics animation processors bit bus), a 32-bit risc processor' b'with math co-processor, video decomp module, a control port, an expansion' b'port (where 3do hangs its double-fast cd player), 1mb dram, an optional' b'video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1mb vram to video' b'processor to tv chain parallel with a dsp to sound chain.' b'' b'they promise red book cd-quality audio, full fps video and a future' b'connection path to your pc via a pc expansion card.' b'' b'i am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and' b'methods discussed here. the article, written by philip de lancie, does' b'cover the other machines mentioned in this thread. i come from the pc' b'tcp/ip world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to' b'the educated consumer; 3do seems to have the right business partners to' b'make this happen.' b'' b'hope this helps.' b'' b'david shute'
