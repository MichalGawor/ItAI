b'' b'' b"i don't think it was that obvious at the time that viola was better." b'morris and viola had comparable k/ip ratios in viola was coming' b'off an injury, whereas morris was healthy.' b'' b"at the time i didn't really want the sox to sign either. i was more" b"than a little worried about viola's elbow." b'' b'but you *surely* remember my shout of relief when, after a week of' b'rumors that morris was coming to the red sox, they ended up with viola' b'instead.' b'' b"now i'm even happier. viola seems to have rebounded nicely." b'' b'also, morris was willing to sign for only two years.' b"the jays don't like to sign pitchers to long-term contracts, which i think" b'is a sensible policy.' b'' b'how long did viola sign for. three years? i generally agree with' b'their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers. but i' b'think they enforce it rather too strictly. these days the premier' b'pitchers all sign three or four year deals. which leaves the jays' b'with morris and stewart. if the jays want to compete for top free' b'agent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.' b'' b'any idea what the option year deal is for morris? are there any' b'automatic activation clauses? what is the buyout amount?f' b'' b'cheers,' b'-valentine'
