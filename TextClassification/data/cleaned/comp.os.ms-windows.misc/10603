b'laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than' b'mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. this has made cosy_pak' b"smaller. thus brian evans' signal processing packages that supported" b'the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the' b'cosy_pak v0.81 are no longer needed directly by cosy_pak v0.9. for' b'power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very' b'fine brian evans package on signal processing (available at' b'the anonymous ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu or ip on' b'the downside, the disadvantage of this update' b'can be that mathematica requires more runtime resources than its' b'previous version.' b'' b'' b'***********************************************************************' b'-- for mathematica users' b'' b'we

standard control' b'engineering texts (ogata phillips and harbor for' b"undergraduate courses in `control engineering i' taught at the systems" b'engineering department of cwru. in addition to the next, they have' b'also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers (tm), and,' b"ibm pc's (tm) running ms windows(tm). we would be very much interested" b'to hear from you if you or anybody
