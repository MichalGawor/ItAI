b'' b'mg \ti went buying simms recently, and the sales person told me that' b'the' b'mg are 9-chip simms and 3-chip simms, and one cannot use them interchan' b'mg if you use one, you have to use all of the same type.' b'' b"don't believe everything you are told. i can tell you that mixing them" b"between 'banks' ok, and i can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless" b'they are of different speeds e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns simms in one' b'bank the two only differ in the type of chips it uses. assuming that' b'the simms are 1mx9 bit wide here is the two equivalent' b'configuration. the 3-chip simm uses two 4-bit wide 4mbit (1m of 4-bit' b'nibbles and one 1-bit wide 1mbit chip for a total of 9-bit wide 1mbyte' b'). the 9-bit simm uses nine 1-bit wide 1mbit chips. these are equivalent' b"because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the simm board. at the simm" b'interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1mbyte simms [sorry' b'if too techie for ya].' b'' b'' b'mg \tsimilarly, one cannot plug in two 1mb simms and one 4mb simms to' b'gi' b'mg the system a total of meg. why is that so if my system supports' b'mg of meg (it has simm slots), can i plug in 4mb simms to give my' b'mg 16mb b'' b'that sounds correct. the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit' b'wide simms, you can not mix different sizes in one bank. why you ask?' b'simple, if you understand why there is banks. assuming you have a 32-bit' b'cpu 386dx or the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data' b'from memory is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see bits when' b'it asks for data. to get that bandwidth 32-bit wide the motherboard' b'links 1mx9 one bit is not data, but parity, so i will ignore that in' b'this simple explaination to get 32bits bits that means' b'that a simm in a bank stores only of the bit wide data. if you' b'have a 16-bit bus, two 1mx9 simms are linked together to get 16-bit wide' b'data, which is the reason why banks are simms wide, and 32-bit banks' b'are simms wide. if your computer required 1mx36 e.g. 32-bit wide data' b'with parity bits, used in some ps/2s and asts you could upgrade by' b'one simm at a time.' b'' b'hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your' b"question was not simple. i could of just said, 'because i said so.'" b'' b'-rdd' b'' b'---' b'. winqwk 2.0b#0 unregistered evaluation copy' b'* kmail 2.95d w-net hq, hal9k.ann-arbor.mi.us, or b'' b'----' b'| hal bbs: qwk-to-usenet gateway four v.32bis dial-ins b'| free usenet mail and newsgroups! pcboard 14.5am uupcb kmail b'| call or b'| member of eff, asp, asad 1500mb disk serving ann arbor since
