b'' b' i cannot speak for dale. but i am quite sure that the macintosh' b'uses the full 16-bit or 32-bit data path to its full advantage. that is,' b'it is running as fast with two or four 30-pin simms as it would with one' b'72-pin simm. now, it may be that longword accesses (assuming a 32-bit' b'data path here) get the first byte from the first simm, the second byte' b'from the second, and so on. this would mean that each longword of memory' b'is actually split among four simms, one for each byte. on the other hand,' b'it could be that the simms are interleaved by word or longword (not just' b'by byte), or they could be successive in memory, and the memory' b'controller deals with the eight-bit data path that each one has. i' b'suspect, though, that they are interleaved to some extent so that bits' b'can be read or written at once. this would indicate a byte-level' b'interleave.' b" i am not confusing this with the new machines' longword" b'interleave with two 72-pin simms of the same sort, although that seems to' b'be the same sort of idea. there, you get an essential 64-bit data path ro' b"(excuse me, to) ram instead of just a 32-bit one. yes, the cpu can't" b'handle it, but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something' b'up.' b' so, dale, am i right? 30-pin simms are interleaved by bytes,' b'allowing the full data bus? or, as is common with usenet and me in' b'particular, am i as clueless as everyone else?' b'' b"what conclusion can be drawn from this? i'm trying to figure out what kind" b'of memory configuration for the lc iii (32-bit datapath) would be fastest. any' b'ideas?' b'' b'thanks,' b'jason macdonald' b'--' b'"technology sufficiently advanced is b'indistinguishable from magic."
