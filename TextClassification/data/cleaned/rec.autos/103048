b'' b'' b"i'm considering switching to geico insurance, but have heard that" b'they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim. i was' b'worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim. i have' b'also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident.' b'' b"i've read in this group that geico has funded the purchasing of radar" b"guns by police depts (i'm not sure where)." b'' b'' b'geico has purchased radar guns in several states, i know they have done' b'it here in ct.' b'' b'i have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by geico' b'for years and then had accident and were immediately dropped. and once' b"you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high" b'risk, and end up forking out or times what you should be for insurance.' b'' b'my suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but stay away from geico!' b'' b'jeff' b'' b''
