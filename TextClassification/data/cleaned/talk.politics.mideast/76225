b'' b'i have just started reading the articles in this news' b'group. there seems to be an attempt by some members to quiet' b'other members with scare tactics. i believe one posting said' b'that all postings by one person are being forwarded to his' b'server who keeps a file on him in hope that "appropriate action' b'might be taken".' b"i don't know where you guys are from but in america" b'such attempts to curtail someones first amendment rights are' b'not appreciated. here, we let everyone speak their mind' b'regardless of how we feel about it. take your fascistic' b'repressive ideals back to where you came from.'
