b'' b' do you know how many deaths each year are caused by self-inflicted gun-' b' shot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters?' b'' b'there are roughly fatal, firearms-related accidents each year.' b'the large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under b'fatal handgun accidents each year. i really doubt all of those' b'occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of "self-inflicted' b'gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters" is probably' b'well under per year.' b'' b'if you fall, for example,' b' and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow, the gun will discharge.' b'' b'handguns designs have included a "hammer block" since around b'or earlier. this is a metal part which physically seperates' b'the cartridge and the firing pin: even under impact, the gun' b'cannot fire. the hammer block is connected to the trigger and' b'is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. as a result,' b'modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or' b'in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.)' b'' b' the number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of' b' deaths caused by animal attacks or "wacko" attacks combined.' b'' b"i don't know about animal attacks, but there are murders" b'each year and under die in the manner you suggest. if only' b'2.1% of the murders were killings by "wacko"s, you would be' b'wrong. worse, there are also rapes and aggravated' b'assaults each year. these numbers make violent attacks, and' b'preventing them, thousands of times more significant than the' b'accidents you are worried about.' b'' b'(these figures, by the way, are from the fbi\'s "uniform crime' b'report" for i\'ll stop by a library tomorrow and look at' b'the "national crime victimization survey", which is more' b'specific about where and when the crimes occured.)' b'' b'frank crary' b'cu boulder' b''
