b'' b'' b' with a sound card on interrupt two serial ports (one for modem on i4,' b' one for miracle piano on i3) and a printer port on i7, i have run out of' b' low interrupts. what i would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of' b' or (which ever interrupt the ps/2 mouse port uses) in in isa' b' i486 computer. i called technical support of microsoft, logitech, ati' b' (checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ati video cards can use)' b' and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones' b' lower than does anyone know of any board for an isa bus which will' b' allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts?' b'' b'try putting one of the irqs for your com ports onto irq2. the hardware will' b'automagically wrap irq2 to irq9 on at class machines (eg, anything with high' b"irqs). this is what i'm doing on my set up right now." b"i've got com2 on irq2 (really irq9 address it this way in software), com1" b'on irq3, soundblaster on irq5, lpt1 on irq7, and my ati busmouse port on one of' b'the interrupts in between. works just great.' b"if you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that" b'details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the' b'higher irqs. it basically involves cutting the trace to the low irq and running a wire over the a high irq pin on the 16bit expansion bus.' b'' b"it will be best to put the modem's com port onto irq2/9. this will be the" b'' b'first irq serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response b"especially handy under multitaskers like os/2 which i'm running with no" b'problems.' b'' b'justin' b'---' b''
