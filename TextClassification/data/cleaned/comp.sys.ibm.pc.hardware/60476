b'' b"they don't have a conflict because technically lpt1: does not use" b'irq7!.' b'the parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes' b'me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip' b'to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as irq7,' b'then onto the main processor as int 0x0f. by default the parallel' b"printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore" b"no int 0x0f's will be sourced from the printer controller chip," b'thus enabling other devices to use the actual irq7.' b'' b'note, this applies to com ports also which by default do not' b"route interrupts to the system bus, although com's software" b'usually enable this feature as it make monitoring com port' b'activity easier than polling the serial uart, thus probably' b'getting the sound card slighty confused!.' b'' b'windows may be a different story....'
