b'' b'' b'' b'i am working on a project to provide an emergency management' b'information system. in keeping with more classic command and' b'control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor' b"system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor." b'i have a number of x level questions regarding this:' b'' b'(we are devloping on unix systems using x/motif. platform will be' b"predominantly sun's, probably with ports to rs/6000 as well)." b'' b'i am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured' b'such that we are talking about one x display and multiple screens,' b'and not multiple x displays. given this:' b'' b'- is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple' b"as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other? there's" b'nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between' b'screens?' b'' b'- do i have to run separate window managers on the separate' b'screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?' b'what are they; who sells them...' b'' b'- is a multi-screen window manager the only way i can grab a' b'window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?' b'' b'- is there any way for the application to transparently see' b'multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware' b'only provide for each screen to start at b'' b'- any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a' b'system capable of using either multiple screens or a single' b'screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate' b'multiple screens instead)?' b'i am assuming that this is not a major issue that i can rely' b'on providing config files which will specify for each' b'configuration the screen placement of each window in the' b'application. any thoughts or suggestions from past experience' b'are more than welcome.' b'' b'' b'========================================================================' b'jo pelkey phone: b'battelle pacific northwest labs fax: b'p.o. box b'richland, wa b'========================================================================' b''
