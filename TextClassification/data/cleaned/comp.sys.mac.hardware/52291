b'' b"i've been playing with a centris for the last couple weeks. the only" b'problem that i have seen is that a couple of the applications i run are' b"incompatible with the 040's processor cache, so i have to run with it turned off." b"actually, the main thing i don't like it is that it doesn't have a software" b'powerup/powerdown, and the power switch is directly under the floppy drive! (i' b"haven't hit it thinking it would eject the disk, but some tired night i'm going" b'to be really upset with that design decision.....)' b'' b'in all, no problems with it. floppy and printing have been just fine. (printing' b'is done across a localtalk net, not a directly connected printer)' b'' b'bill'
