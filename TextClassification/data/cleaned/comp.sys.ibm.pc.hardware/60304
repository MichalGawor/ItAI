b'' b'i am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any' b'real reviews of them. one of the cards the local stores are pushing is' b'the genoa for apparently it uses a cirrus logic acc. chip,' b"but i don't know which one (gd5426?). one of the shops i've spoken with" b'claims the card out-performs the diamond stealth vl and the orchid' b"fahrenheit plus vl cards (s3 86c805 based), but that can't be true" b'if it is using the gd5426. i like the price of the genoa but if it' b"lags in performance behind the s3 cards, i'll pay the extra for one" b'of them.' b'' b'any info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. if i get replies via' b"email, i'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested." b'' b'thanks in advance,' b''
