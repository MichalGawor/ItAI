b'' b"hi there! i have a few games that i'd like to run under windows and can't" b'get the pifs adjusted right. for example wing commander. in my dos prompt, i' b'have more than 620k available for programs. this is enough to run wc.' b'so i build a pif giving wc a couple of megs of extended memory etc.. and run' b'it. wc prompts: "loading wing commander..." and then a message about' b'"using extended memory..." etc... and then my screen goes black (just before' b'the opening scene-the orchestra-would have appeared.)' b'' b'i also have a pool game that does almost the same thing. it opens up and' b'prompts me for what kind of video driver i have. (cga, ega, etc...) i' b'respond ega and the screen goes black.' b'' b'on both of these a ctrl-alt-del getss me back to windows.' b'' b'has anyone run wing commander under windows? or has had the problems i' b"describe and fixed them? here's the rest of my setup:" b'' b'400mb disk free' b'8mb memory free during win session' b'386dx-25' b'' b'respond here or on e-mail. if anyone else needs this info, send me mail in' b"a couple of days, and i'll forward the replies to you." b'' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'clinton a. pierce cartesian bear polar bear after coordinate transform' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
