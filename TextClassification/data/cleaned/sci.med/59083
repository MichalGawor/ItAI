b'' b'i experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning. just after' b'i completed my 4th set of deep squats. today was my weight training' b'day and i was just beginning my routine. all of a sudden at the end of' b'the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep. it was cold, turned pale,' b"and lost of its strength. the weight i used for squats wasn't that" b'heavy, i was working hard but not at effort. i waited for a few' b'minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with' b'chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than i normally use. but' b'i dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued' b'arm weakness into the second. so i quit training and decided not to do my' b"usual hour on the ski machine either. i'll take it easy for the rest of" b'the day.' b'' b'my arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal b'my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. color has returned to normal' b'and it is no longer cold.' b'' b'horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through' b"my brain. i'm vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise" b"regimen. so that can't be it. could a pinched nerve from the bar" b'cause these symptoms (i hope)?' b'' b'has this happened to anyone else?' b'nothing like this has ever happened to me before. does it come with age?' b'' b'thanks,' b'tom' b'--' b'tom molnar' b'unix systems group, university of toronto computing communications.'
