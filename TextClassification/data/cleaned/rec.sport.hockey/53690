b'' b'here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have' b'affected the ahl this year.' b'' b'' b"st john's maple leafs problems" b"the st john's maple leafs sophomore season has been plagued by" b'problems. on-ice, the leafs won the atlantic division title but' b'off ice was less happy. a strike by public workers has forced the' b'leafs out of the newfoundland city for much of the last half of' b'the seaosn (since mid-jan). they have played "home" games in places' b'like montreal, cornwall and charlottetown. their playoff "home"' b'games will be played in the metro center in halifax, ns. one' b"demostration got violent. workers attacked a leafs' bus and" b"rocked it and broke windows in the st john's memorial stadium." b'despite the problems, toronto officials insist that the leafs' b"will return to st john's once the strike ends." b'===================================================' b'senators sold' b'the new haven senators have been sold by peter shipman to' b'the ottawa senators nhl organization. they are the only canadian' b'nhl team with an american ahl affiliate, and have made it clear' b'they intend to move the team to somewhere in the canadian atlantic' b'provinces. this sale and move has yet to be approved by the ahl' b'head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting' b'in may. the quote in the story from jack butterfield made it' b'clear the league was more interested in the stability of the' b'ahl franchise accompanied by nhl ownership, rather than maintaining' b'the 56-year history of the ahl in new haven.' b'' b'the senators are currently in serious negotiations with charlottetown' b'new brunswick and are expected to move there.' b'==================================================' b'dallas helps hawks stay in moncton' b'after announcing that they would pull their affiliation out' b'of moncton, the winnipeg jets changed their mind.' b'' b'the jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing' b'their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they' b'wanted to share with an existing ahl or ihl franchise.' b'' b'enter the dallas lone stars. dallas agreed to supply the remaining' b'6 or players to the moncton franchise. thus keeping the hawks' b'in the new brunswick city.' b'' b'the deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if' b'the season ticket base increases to over the hawks only sold' b'1400 for this year.' b'============================================================' b'saint john flames official' b'the calgary flames have officially signed a deal with the city of' b'saint john, nb. the saint john blue flames will play in the b'exhibition center. the flames still have to apply for an expansion' b'frnachise from the ahl but are expected to have no trouble.' b'=========================================================' b'caps follow jacks to maine' b'despite rumors to the contrary, the capitals will follow the baltimore' b"skipjacks to maine. the caps' current farm team, the baltimore skipjacks," b'announced that they would move to maine and become the portland pirates.' b'there was much doubt as to if the caps would follow but they announced' b'a limited deal with portland. they would supply a dozen or so players' b'including goalies. they become the third team to announce a limited' b'farm team along with moncton and the capital district islanders.' b'======================================================' b'ahl game of the week' b'in early january, the ahl started a game of the week. the game, produced' b'by, i believe, pyman productions, was televised across the canadian' b'maritimes and northeastern us. the first few weeks saw two games of' b'the week, one in canada and another in the us but since then, there' b'has been only one. sunday afternoon and night games were covered and' b'shown on sportschannel ny and ne in the us and, i believe, atlantic' b"sports network in canada (but i'm not sure about that). i am not" b'sure if playoff games will be covered.' b'=====================================================' b'utica gone? syracuse added?' b'there were heavy rumors that the utica devils will not be around next' b'season. there were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern' b'city and that the city of syracuse is trying to lure them.' b'=====================================================' b'what the ahl might look like next year' b'' b'one option\t\t\t\tanother option' b'' b'northern division\t\t\tsouthern division' b'adirondack red wings\t\t\tadirondack' b'springfield indians\t\t\tspringfield' b'providence bruins\t\t\tprovidence' b'cd islanders\t\t\t\tcdi' b'portland pirates\t\t\thershey' b'binghamton' b'southern division\t\t\trochester' b'hershey bears\t\t\t\thamilton' b'binghamton rangers\t\t\tutica' b'rochester americans' b'hamilton canucks\t\t\tatlantic division' b'utica devils\t\t\tportland' b"st john's" b'atlantic division\t\t\tsaint john' b"st john's maple leafs\t\t\tmoncton" b'moncton hawks\t\t\t\thalifax' b'halifax citadels\t\t\tfredericton' b'cape breton oilers\t\t\tcape breton' b'fredericton canadiens\t\t\tcharlottetown' b'saint john blue flames' b'charlottetown senators (move is unofficial as yet)' b'' b'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++' b'+ ahl and ecac contact for rec.sport.hockey\t\tgo usa hockey!\t b"+ adirondack red wings, calder cup champs: '92\t b"+ clarkson hockey, ecac tournament champ: '93\t\t b"+ glens falls high school, division ii ny state champs: \t b'+ congrats to clarkson golden knights hockey: ecac champions!!! b'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++'
