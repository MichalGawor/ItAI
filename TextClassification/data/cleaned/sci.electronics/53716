b'' b'what you can do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is' b'to use a gfci outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper). in fact,' b'depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a gfci may be *required*.' b'' b' you still need to supply a proper ground for a ground fault circuit interrupter!' b'' b'not according to the nec nor the cec, as explained in the electrical wiring' b'faq, which i posted here separately. note the material under the headings' b'' b'' b'and' b'' b' \tshould the test button work?' b'' b'of course, as they said "local codes may vary".' b'' b' so rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to' b' a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.' b'' b"i'm not sure about this. if the ground connections on the outlets are" b'connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the' b'main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground' b'rod. a connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of' b'the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot' b'to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.' b'' b'hmmm. how are those orange "isolated ground" outlets (often used in' b'computer rooms) wired?' b'' b'--- jamie hanrahan, kernel mode systems, san diego ca'
