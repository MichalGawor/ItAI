b'' b"i'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a" b'lot: what morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents?' b"in normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously" b"you aren't morally responsible for your actions. but if you can contrive" b'to control the action in dreams or do an oobe, it seems like a morality applies.' b'' b'' b'well i am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes' b'control their dreams. for example, i might decide before going to' b'sleep that i want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a' b'specific place. or if i am having an unpleasant dream, i can often' b'(not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.' b'' b'i guess i think that the same standards apply in these "directed"' b'dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref jesus teaching' b'about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing' b'adultary).' b'' b'when my normal dreams display themes that i would not conciously chose' b'to dream about, i take that as a sign that all is not well with my' b'"inner life" maybe i have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be' b'resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin. in either case, the cause' b'needs to be resolved.' b'' b"in fact, either case is pretty rare. i don't" b"often remember dreams that i don't chose to have. when i do, they" b'almost always tell me something important.' b'i also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour' b"(in fact i've had precisely one full colour picture dream that i can" b'remember, and it was definately spiritually important)' b'i tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and' b'white.' b'' b"interesting topic i'll be fascinated to read other responses." b'' b'alison' b'' b"ps. just to make it clear, i don't do and have never tried oobes." b'i tend to think they are off limits for christians.'
