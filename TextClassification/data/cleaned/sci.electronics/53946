b'' b'mjmhi, i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related' b'mjmsubjects. i am currently learning about am/fm receivers and recieving' b'mjmcircuits. i understand a lot of things ,but a few things i am confused' b'mjmabuot. the first is the mixer, to mix the rf and local oscillator' b'mjmfrequencies to make the if. does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as' b'mjmsimple as possible) for this kind of mixer? i have come across a' b'mjmmc-sbl mixer chip but i have not been able to find it in any catalogs' b'mjm(active,etc...)' b'' b'mjmalong the same note, are there any simple fm receiver circuits anyone' b'mjmmay have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.' b'' b'mjmp.s. any really good books on am/fm theory along with detailed' b'mjmelectrical diagrams would help a lot.' b'mjmi have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of' b'mjmcircuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.' b'' b'digi-key has the ne-622 chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on' b'one chip.' b'' b'for a great combination of theory with actual circuits, the best' b"reference for non-engineers is probably the radio amateur's handbook" b"from the arrl. most library's have it in the reference section." b'' b'' b"* slmr if ignorance is bliss, why aren't there more happy folk?" b'' b'----' b'the ozone hole bbs a private bulletin board service b'3 full service nodes usrobotics 16.8k bps gigs files' b'skydive new orleans! rime network mail hub usenet newsgroups'
