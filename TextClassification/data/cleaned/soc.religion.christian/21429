b'' b'' b'[...]' b'' b'there are other interpretations to christian history in this matter.' b'one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostics was' b'written by their enemies. eusebius claims that jesus imparted secret' b'information to peter, james, and john after his resurrection, and that' b'those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the twelve' b'(eusebius, _historia ecclesiastica_ ii b'' b'this is curious. i read in _eh_...' b'' b'"the lord imparted the gift of knowledge to james the just, to john' b'and peter after his resurrection, these delivered it to the rest of' b'the apostles, and they to the seventy, of whom barnabas was one."' b'' b'--- eusebius, _ecclesiastical history_' b'' b'it seems that the lord imparted the gift of knowledge, not that the' b'lord imparted secret information.' b'' b'[...]' b'' b'apostles. interestingly enough, eusebius refers to the groups which' b'we today call gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (eusebius,' b'op. cit., iii, his gripe was not that thay professed *a*' b'gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.' b'' b"i'm afraid that i cannot find this portrayal in _eh_." b"i don't see anywhere in where eusebius mentions that certain" b'gnostics had the wrong gnosis.' b'' b"the closest is when eusebius summarizes hegesippus' statements," b'"...whilst if there were any at all, that attempted to pervert' b'the sound doctrine of the saving gospel, they were yet skulking' b'in dark retreats..."' b'' b'now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways. i' b"don't intend that everyone interpret christian history as i do, but i" b'believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of' b'early christian rites analogous to those practiced by mormons today.' b'' b'"favorably interpreted?" just in looking at two of the four' b'references that you gave (i have the _eh_ handy, irenaeus and the' b'_clemetine recognitions_ i will have to look for) i see no room for' b"such 'interpretations.'" b'' b"and any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to" b'the temple ceremonies.' b'' b'the links for jay\'s using _eh_ for support are: "imparting the gift' b'of knowledge" "imparted secret information" "being given secret' b'signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven." but there is not' b'enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call' b'this "favorable interpretation." it appears to be closer to' b'"fabrication."' b'' b'=============================' b'robert weiss'
