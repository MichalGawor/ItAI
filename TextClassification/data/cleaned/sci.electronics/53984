b'' b'what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments?' b'' b'pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment' b'(octave, octave, etc). thus the 10khz-20khz octave has the same' b'amount of noise power as the 10hz-20hz octave.' b'white noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment' b'(hz, khz, etc). thus the 10khz-10.1khz band has the same amount of' b'noise power as the 10hz-110hz band (both bands are 100hz wide).' b'pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octave' b'filter (usually approximated by a network of several rc pairs).' b"note: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network" b':-(' b'pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.' b'it shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands)' b'as a flat line across the bands.' b'' b'davep'
