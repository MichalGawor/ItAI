(you can see the effects of this on any daytime' b'launch. the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the ssme exhaust is' b'fluffy white steam. watch for the difference between the "top"' b'[orbiter side] and the "bottom" [external tank side] of the stack.) the' b'access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented' b"basically the same way they were for the saturn v's. (a side note: the" b"saturn v's also had a roll program. don't ask me why i'm a shuttle" b'guy.)' b'' b'i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics.\the added that the "roll' b'maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.' b'the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons' b'stated. the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping' b'the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance. the yaw' b'component is used to determine the orbital inclination. the total' b'maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math' b'concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element' b'array.' b'' b'' b'how to receive the nasa tv channel, nasa select' b'' b'nasa select is broadcast by satellite. if you have access to a satellite' b'dish, you can find select on satcom f2r, transponder c-band, b'degrees west longitude, audio frequency mhz. f2r is stationed' b'over the atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from' b'california and points west. during events of special interest (e.g.' b'shuttle missions), select is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite' b'for these viewers.' b'' b"if you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry select." b"it's worth asking if yours doesn't." b'' b'the select schedule is found in the nasa headline news which is' b'frequently posted to sci.space.news. generally it carries press' b'conferences, briefings by nasa officials, and live coverage of shuttle' b'missions and planetary encounters. select has recently begun carrying' b'much more secondary material (associated with spacelink) when missions' b'are not being covered.' b'' b'' b'amateur radio frequencies for shuttle missions' b'' b'the following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:' b'' b'w6fxn los angeles' b'k6mf ames research center, mountain view, california' b'wa3nan goddard space flight center (gsfc), greenbelt, maryland.' b'w5rrr johnson space center (jsc), houston, texas' b'w6vio jet propulsion laboratory (jpl), pasadena, california.' b'w1aw voice bulletins' b'' b'station vhf\t 10m\t 15m\t 20m\t 40m\t 80m' b'------\t -----\t-----' b'w6fxn\t b'k6mf\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840' b'wa3nan\t 7.185\t3.860' b'w5rrr\t 7.227\t3.850' b'w6vio\t 224.04\t\t b'w6vio\t 224.04\t\t 7.165\t3.840' b'w1aw\t\t 7.290\t3.990' b'' b'w5rrr transmits mission audio on a special event station on the' b'other frequencies supplying keplerian elements and mission information.' b'' b'w1aw also transmits on no mission audio but they' b'transmit voice bulletins at and utc.' b'' b'frequencies in the 10-20m bands require usb and frequencies in the b'and 80m bands lsb. use fm for the vhf frequencies.' b'' b'[this item was most recently updated courtesy of gary morris' b'' b'' b'solid rocket booster fuel composition' b'' b'reference: "shuttle flight operations manual" volume 8b solid rocket' b'booster systems, nasa document jsc-12770' b'' b'propellant composition (percent)' b'' b'ammonium perchlorate (oxidizer)\t\t\t69.6' b'aluminum\t\t\t\t\t\t16' b'iron oxide (burn rate catalyst)\t\t\t0.4' b'polybutadiene-acrilic acid-acrylonitrile (a rubber) b'epoxy curing agent\t\t\t\t\t1.96' b'' b'end reference' b'' b'comment: the aluminum, rubber, and epoxy all burn with the oxidizer.' b'' b'next: faq historical planetary probes'
