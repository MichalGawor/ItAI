b'' b'' b'' b'there are a number of philosophical questions that i would like to ask:' b'' b'1) if we encounter a life form during our space exploration, how do we' b'determine if we should capture it, imprison it, and then discect it?' b'' b'analog sf magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few' b'years ago. the question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in' b'washington, d.c., what was the proper organization to deal with it: the' b'state department (alien ambassadors), the defense department (alien' b'invaders), the immigration and naturalization service (illegal aliens),' b'the department of the interior (new non-human species), etc. it was' b'very much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything' b'intrinsic in their nature. the bibliography for the article cited a' b'philosophical paper (the name and author of which i sadly forget; i' b'believe the author was italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral' b'person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a' b'person. the paper was quite interesting, as i recall.' b'' b'2) if we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will' b'we expend resources from earth to help them?' b'' b"i think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes. the" b'human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does' b'underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible. the' b'usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the' b"culture. this may not always be wrong, but that's the way to bet." b'' b'3) with all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable,' b"what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought" b"back, or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere?" b'' b'--' b'have a day,' b'' b' bobo' b'' b'doug loss'
