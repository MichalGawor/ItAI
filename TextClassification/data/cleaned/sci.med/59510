b'' b'' b': am i justified in being pissed off at this doctor?' b':' b': last saturday evening my year old son cut his finger badly with a knife.' b': i took him to a local "urgent and general care" clinic at pm. the' b': clinic was open till pm. the receptionist went to the back and told the' b'<: ....other good stuff about the drs idiocy' b'' b'ok, much as i hate to do it, here i am posting an even better "dr. idiot"' b'story.' b'' b'' b'i was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for hours and was' b'exhausted. my ob and i decided to go for a csec. the ob called in' b'the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.' b'' b'after, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as' b'i like to refer to him) said, "well, i am off duty now." (still staring' b'between my legs at that). the ob asked to go call whomever it was who' b'was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going' b'to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.' b'' b'the anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes. in a couple of' b'minutes the nurse came running in to tell the ob that the anes. had left' b'without even trying to get ahold of the on-call. it was the only time' b'during my labor that i swore. the on-call anes. took minutes to get' b'there.' b'' b'come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about minutes' b'before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the' b'next on-call got there. good thing for all of us (especially him) that' b'it was not a critical emergency. but boy would i love to knock that' b"fellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a" b'few little minutes.' b'' b'' b'' b'i have run into "dr. idiots", "mechanic idiots", "clerk idiots" and "etc.' b'idiots" in my time, but this fellow i would like to have words with.' b'' b'' b'deantha'
