b'' b'hi!' b'a while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the iwii' b'in europe (in countries with hz ac current). the consensus at the time' b'was that the iwii would not work there. as i will be moving there this summer,' b'i called apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the iwii (as bought' b'in the u.s.) will definitely run on hz ac current (as long as a step-down' b'converter is employed if v current is used). the same info, turns out, can' b"be found in the iwii manual (p. in the version), but i didn't really" b'trust that. does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary? just' b'wondering.' b'' b'chris w.'
