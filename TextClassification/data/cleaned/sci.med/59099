b'' b'for several years i have been dealing with reccurring corneal erosion. there' b'does not seem to be much known about the cause of such a problem. my current' b"episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea. if it's" b'bad enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy. however, my doctor' b'this time is trying to let it heal by itself by putting a contact lens to' b"protect the area. apparently the problem is not that common, but i'd be curious" b'if anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can be' b'found.' b'' b'mark london'
