b'' b' since one is also unlikely to get "the truth" from either arab or' b' palestinian news outlets, where do we go to "understand", to learn?' b' is one form of propoganda more reliable than another? the only way' b' to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer\'s "political' b' agenda", whether it is "on" or "against" our *side*.' b'' b' tim' b'first let me correct myself in that it was goerbels and' b'not goering (airforce) who ran the nazi propaganda machine. i' b'agree that arab news sources are also inherently biased. but i' b'believe the statement i was reacting to was that since the' b'american accounts of events are not fully like the israeli' b'accounts, the americans are biased. i just thought that the' b'israelis had more motivation for bias.' b'the un has tried many times to condemn israel for its' b'gross violation of human rights. however the us has vetoed most' b'such attempts. it is interesting to note that the u.s. is often' b'the only country opposing such condemnation (well the u.s. and' b'israel). it is also interesting to note that that means' b'other western countries realize these human rights violations.' b'so maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.'
