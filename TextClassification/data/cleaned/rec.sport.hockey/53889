b'' b'the san jose sharks and ottawa senators are each on their second gm' b"already...i'd be willing to wager that both the sharks and senators" b"will probably see their 3rd gm's and perhaps their 4th, before we" b'see the panthers second.' b'' b'actually, fired-coach george kingston was a third of the gm' b'triumvirate. now that the trio is now duo (dean lombardi and chuck' b'grillo), the sharks are already on their 3rd "office of the gm". and a' b"4th is likely to happen before september; they'll either add the new" b'coach to the oofgm, or name a single gm. so your wager should be' b'amended to read that sharks are likely to have their 5th gm before the' b"panther's get their 2nd. can't wait to see how the next season's nhl" b'guide and record book lists the gm history of the sharks.' b'' b"given the depth of next year's draft, the expansion draft rules, and" b'the reputation of their gms, anaheim and miami look pretty good as the' b'first 90s expansion teams to win a cup. san jose and ottawa have' b'instability at the gm position, something that philly, nyi, edmonton,' b'and calgary did not have when they won their first cups. pittsburgh' b'did, but they needed a quarter century.' b'--' b"their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburgh's. their" b'players are mighty bright, too. i mean, he really *was* going to get his' b"wallet back, right?'' jan brittenson on leaf/pen woofers in" b'rec.sport.hockey'
