b'' b'' b'' b' i have just one thing to say about this: write your congressperson!' b' the fbi and batf storm troopers must not be allowed to get away with' b" this. demand a full investigation of the waco survivor's story of" b" the lantern being knocked over by the tank. we can't bring anybody" b' back from the dead, but we may be able to send a few of them to' b' political hell.' b'' b'i heard over npr yesterday morning that arlan specter, senator from' b'pennsylvania, has already called for a congressional investigation.' b'the problem is that specter was one of the key government attorneys several' b'years ago who did what he could to coverup facts in the assassinations' b'of jfk and others. that is to say, the chief fox wants to check out' b'the hen house. writing your representatives is a great idea. when' b'you do ask that they keep specter and his cronies far away from' b'any investigation.' b'' b' would someone please post the generic addresses for congress and' b' senate so that we can all write letters?' b'--' b'* b'joe gaut in the super-state, it really does not' b'red-neck and proud of it. truth is what the government chooses to' b'| tell you. justice is what it wants to happen.' b'jim garrison, new orleans, la.'
