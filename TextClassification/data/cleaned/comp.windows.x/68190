b'' b'' b'hey folks,' b"i'm attempting to use imake to manage makefiles for a development effort and was curious" b'to find out if anybody else is experiencing problems with any target that' b'has subdirs generated by imake on solaris platforms.' b'' b"for example, 'make makefiles' chokes in the very first subdirectory." b'' b'\ti.e. target: subdirmakefiles not found' b'' b"you don't give the precise error message, but i assume that" b"the making of the target fails, because make can't find the rules." b'' b"we've seen this happen with sunos 5.x make as well and aat this" b"point i'm not sure why it happens. it seems to happen" b'with large makefiles. the entries near the end get lost.' b'small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem,' b'as it does in your example.' b'' b'in the mit r5 distribution r5.sunos5.patch this can happen with' b"the target ``makefiles'' in one of the doc directories." b'' b'at first i thought this was a bug with make on my sun, but i built and used gnumake with the' b"same results. attached you'll find the first makefiles target rule from the generated makefile" b'' b'this is really weird. are your *really* sure that you were using gnu make?' b'' b'casper'
