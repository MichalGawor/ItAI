b'' b'does xdm work with decnet? i have an ultrix machine running both tcp/ip' b'and decnet. i have a number of x-terminals hanging off the ultrix host also' b'running tcp/ip and decnet. presently i am using xdm for the login procedure' b'on the x-terminals using tcp/ip. since xdm is basically just an x-windows' b"client, shouldn't i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well?" b'' b'my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client. it is making' b'tcp/ip specific socket calls. in this case the answer would be no; you can' b'not run xdm over decnet. is this right or not? any feedback is appreciated.' b'thanks.'
