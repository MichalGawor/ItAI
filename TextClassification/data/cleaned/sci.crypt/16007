b'' b" the nsa's charter forbids them from doing any purely domestic" b' intelligence work, i would think that even providing assistance in' b' development of the skipjack algorithom is a violation of that charter.' b' but as with any intrenched government agency, they will do what they' b' think is expedent.' b'' b'there are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject. for' b'example, the national computer security act of specifically directs' b'nbs [sic] to work with nsa on developing security standards for civilian' b'federal computers. (pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes' b'a report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including' b"concerns about nsa's involvement.) note also that nsa is specifically" b'charged with running the national computer security center, to' b'quote the aforementioned report ``nsa also will work with industries at' b'the dod computer security center to develop security standards for private' b"sector use.''" b'' b'it may or may not be a good idea to have nsa tinkering with this, but' b"i'm pretty sure it's legal. (btw when it comes to development of" b'cryptosystems, there may be two choices. either nsa helped develop it,' b'in which case maybe they can crack it, maybe not, but probably, no one' b"else can; or nsa didn't help, in which case they probably can crack it," b'and maybe others as well...)'
