b'' b'' b'i have become involved in a project to further develop and' b'improve the performance of spect (single photon emission' b'computerized tomography) imaging. we will eventually have' b'to peddle this stuff somewhere, and so as i move this thing' b'along, i would like to know b'' b'what is the current resolution of spect imaging? what kinds' b'of jobs is spect used for, specifically? what kind of specific jobs' b'could i hope' b'that spect could be used for, if its resolution improved,' b'say, to close to that of pet (positron emission tomography)?' b'and how much does a spect machine cost? how much does a single' b'spect image cost?' b'' b'if anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions, or' b'where i could find that answer, i would be very grateful, indeed.' b'thanks in advance for any replies' b'' b'dave eliezer' b'' b'' b'' b''
