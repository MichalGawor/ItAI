b'' b'' b'' b"this is not true. the athiest's position is that there is no proof of the" b'existence of god. as much as some people accept their church, their priests' b'or straight from their own scriptures as the "proof", this does not' b'satisfy atheists.' b'' b"you haven't fully explained the atheist position. many theists believe that" b'there is "no proof of the existence of god" but choose to believe in him' b"anyway. i haven't yet found an argument for atheism that can't quickly be" b"broken down to unprovable assumptions. this isn't a problem with me (everybody" b'needs to have a faith) but if you believe that you can provide a "purely' b'logical" argument for the nonexistence of god, i\'d really like to see it.' b'' b'are you asking us to believe blindly? you are trying to deny that part of' b'us that makes us ask the question "does god exist?" i.e. self-awareness and' b'reason. if we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant' b'as the other animals on this earth. does god want us to be like that?' b'' b'you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything. however, if' b'we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone. and since' b'we can only use faith, why is one picture of "god" (e.g. hinduism) any less' b'valid than another (e.g. christianity)?' b'' b'ahh...but when you use science and reason, you have faith in certain beliefs' b'of the scientific method--for example:' b'' b'the physical laws of the universe are stable.' b'our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth.' b'objective reality exists.' b'logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions.' b'' b'can you prove any of these?' b'' b'alan terlep\t\t\t\t "...and the scorpion says, \'it\'s' b'oakland university, rochester, mi\t\tin my nature.\'"'
