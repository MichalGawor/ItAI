b'' b'' b' i would like to buy a bit adc card for the mac ii with digitization' b' rate of at least khz, preferably khz. i would prefer one with' b' good differential and integral linearity, and dma would be a plus. other' b' than national instruments, do you know of any other vendor who sells such' b' a card?' b'' b' instrutech corp has a nice looking bit a/d and d/a board that can run' b" at the speeds you want. the itc-16 doesn't have dma, but it does have" b' a good sized fifo that can buffer your samples. instrutech can be reached' b' at or (fax).' b'' b'' b"i don't know about the instrutech boards (though i plan to check them out)," b'but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and s/n ratio of' b'many of the bit" boards out there. the ni boards are very clearly' b'specified in terms of monotonicity, s/n ratio, accuracy, etc; and the' b'nb-a2100 and nb-a2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from' b"distortion that you'd expect from a good, true bit converter. this is" b'not true for the spectral innovations boards, for example.'
