b'' b'organization: university of south dakota' b'bitmaps i am posting one.' b'date: pm' b'_______________________________________________________' b'due to the resolution and size it is in parts.' b'' b'this is a uuencoded bitmap. 960x600 colors.' b'the picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background.' b'the size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display' b'because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons' b'to fit in without being on top of the picture. reguarding image' b'quality and resolution i have not seen much better.' b'' b'please do not do this!' b'' b"i don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how i do it: i" b'subscribe to an "outernet" system which allows me to dial up via modem and' b'download e-mail and news articles automatically. when someone posts a' b'huge attached binary file, i have no choice but to receive it along with' b'all the other new articles in the groups i subscribe to. i also pay for' b'the connect time, which is normally not a problem because i have a 14.4k' b"modem and each day's upload/download session takes only minutes or so." b"today's session, however, lasted about minutes because of roman.bmp." b'consequently, it cost me about extra just to receive a file that i' b"didn't want in the first place." b'' b'if you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other' b'ways to do it: either upload the file to an ftp site (like' b'ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete windows section) and tell' b'people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like' b'alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives' b"rather than discussion groups. don't use discussion groups like this one" b"to send out attached files, especially when they're 600k in size." b'' b'thanks' b'ed klein' b'' b''
