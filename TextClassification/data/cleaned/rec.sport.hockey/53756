their lead to goals at the mark. the kings shot' b'the puck into the near corner of the flames zone. vernon went behind the net to' b'cut off the puck but he could not control it. donnelly, who was

vernon on the ice, stick side.' b'' b'at the mark, skrudland went off for slashing and stern went crazy as he' b'went after shuchuk. stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single' b'minor for cross checking and a minute misconduct, and he took the flames' b'right out of the game.' b'' b'on the plus side: the kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey' b'as they let
