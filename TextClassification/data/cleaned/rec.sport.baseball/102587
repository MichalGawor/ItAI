b'' b'the rotation has changed due to a "strange" injury to scott erickson. he' b'developed a twinge in the stomach area and has been taken out of the' b"rotation. new rotation (to the best of my mind's knowledge) is:" b'kevin tapani, jim deshais, pat mahomes, willie banks.' b'' b'add mike trombley in there somewhere, since they need five people. mark' b'guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty.' b'' b'as to ss and 3b:' b'short will be played by scott leius who played short for much of his career' b'before the twins. at third mike pagliarulo and jeff reboulet will platoon.' b'' b'pags and terry jorgenson will platoon at third, with reboulet as the' b'backup infielder. pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who' b'lead the league in da in muffing what should be routine grounders' b'(heck, muffing a grounder *i* would probably have gotten to). jorgenson' b'did nothing exceptional that i noticed. leius missed a ball i *think*' b"gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss gag's glove this season." b'' b'winfield has struggled during preseason. sunday against the colorado' b'rockies he went for with rbis and scored once.' b'' b'he looked pretty good there. contrary to what the mediots have been saying,' b"he looked reasonable at first. he isn't mid-80s hrbek, but then neither is" b"the pretty big guy himself any more (note: i'm used to seeing the twins" b'1b looking kinda big on the field, but not that big!). if he hits vaguely' b"like last year, he's a perfectly good first baseman." b'' b'note: much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game' b'where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings. winfield may' b"have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up (he didn't have to" b"pick any bad throws, for example), but i'll take what i saw so far." b'' b'david thornley' b'"have tickets, will travel to dome"' b''
