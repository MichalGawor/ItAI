b'' b"recently i've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon" b'cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition. in' b'particular, dr. bernard jenssen in his book "colon cleansing for' b'health and longevity" the title actually escapes me, but it is very' b'similar to that claims that regular self-administered colonics,' b'along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts' b'the immune system to a significant degree.' b'' b'he also plugs a unique appliance called the "colema board", which' b'facilitates the self-administration of colonics. it sells for over' b'$100 from a california-based company. he also plugs vitra-tox' b'products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,' b'supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its' b'bulkiness.' b'' b'if anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its' b"particulars, or the colema board and related products, i'd be very" b'interested to hear about research and personal experience.' b'' b'this article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon' b'fasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification.' b'' b'-- eli' b'' b'--' b'/-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\' b'\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------/'
