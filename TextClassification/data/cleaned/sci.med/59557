b'' b'i am quite near sighted.' b'' b"i've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal" b'holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. in my' b'left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the' b'laser was used to "weld" this back in place as well.' b'' b'my right eye seems fine. in my left eye i was seeing occasional' b'flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. since the' b'treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often' b'- several each hour.' b'' b'the opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the' b'vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. he' b'says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own' b'accord if it tugs enough i may well face retinal detachment.' b'' b'i am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.' b'the dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations' b'so i appreciate any further details anyone can provide. of most' b'interest to me:' b'' b'if my retina does detach what should be my immediate course' b'of action?' b'' b'if conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is' b'the procedure like and what kind of vision can i expect' b'afterwards.' b'' b'do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment' b'maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.' b'' b'many thanks' b'' b'bill' b'--' b'bill wilder, computer systems manager' b'kentville research station' b'agriculture canada' b'kentville, nova scotia'
