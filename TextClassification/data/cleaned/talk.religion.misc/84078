b'' b'' b'evolution, as i have said before, is theory _and_ fact. it is exactly' b'the same amount of each as the existence of atoms and the existence of' b'gravity. if you accept the existence of atoms and gravity as fact,' b'then you should also accept the existence of evolution as fact.' b'' b'--' b'--andy' b'' b"i don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either. they are extremely useful" b'mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.' b'other posters have aptly explained the atomic model. gravity, too, is' b'very much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but we' b'have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on' b'objects by this thing we _call_ gravity. gravity, however, is _not_' b'a fact. it is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects' b'behave in our physical environment. newton thought gravity was a' b'simple vector force; einstein a wave. both are very useful models that' b'have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you' b'want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly' b'the way the theory now formulated talks about it. that takes a great' b'leap of faith, which, of course, is what religion takes. evolution' b'is no different.' b'' b'--' b'' b"are you serious?!!! here's an exercise next time you are in the barnyard." b'take *your* model and hold it directly above a fresh cowpie. then release the' b'model. you will observe that on its own *your* model will assume a trajectory' b'earthward and come to rest exactly where it belongs. watch out for splatters,' b'particularly if you are wearing shorts when you perform this experiment.' b'' b'rich fox, anthro, usouthdakota'
