b'' b'a friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can' b'format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a hd disk. apparently it' b'rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or _something_ that allows it get' b'more space out of a normal hd floppy disk. it supposedly gets upto megs' b"(so something like 1640k?). i don't have the program since i can't use it" b'and its supposed to be called something like "form16" or something like that.' b'' b'my question is whether its possible to do this on the mac and if its not' b'possible is it due to hardware limitations. a developer friend of mine said' b"that it might be possible but he doesn't deal with this aspect of the field" b'much.' b'' b'thanks for any information contributed.' b'' b'' b'steve' b'' b''
