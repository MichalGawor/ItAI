b'' b'\ti was wondering if people had any good uses for old' b'256k simms. i have a bunch of them for the apple mac' b'and i know lots of other people do to. i have tried to' b'sell them but have gotten no interest.' b'' b'how hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular' b'motorola microcontrollers. i am a novice at microcontrollers, but i am' b'starting to get into them for some of my projects. i have several 256k' b'simms laying around from upgraded macs and if i could use them as "free"' b'memory in one or two of my projects that would be great. one project that' b'comes to mind is a caller id device that would require quite a bit of ram' b'to store several hundered cid records etc...' b'' b'- dan' b'--' b'' b'go bengals! go bucks!'
