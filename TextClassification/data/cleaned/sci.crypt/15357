(for their' b'own good of course. i mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp!' b'start to hide things from the irs, sell drugs/guns/pornography, and' b'that cannot be allowed!)' b'' b'trials. ever seen ed meese pissed? i have, it was when he said that socialism' b'and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.' b'it took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.' b'' b'not very surprising to anyone who believes in "hands off" government. if' b'you believe that your private life (both social and financial) are none of' b"anyone else's business, the difference between socialism and communism is" b'like the difference between murder by lethal injection or by' b'chainsaw. the more centralized the economy is, the more potential' b'abuses for accumulation of information on individuals. if you think' b"credit companies are bad, well, i'm sure a democratic socialist society" b'would vote for absolute privacy of all citizens not!'
