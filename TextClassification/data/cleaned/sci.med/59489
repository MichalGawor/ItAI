b'' b'hi stephen' b'ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing' b'a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties. too much can block the' b'external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some' b'hearing problems. it is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your' b"own, or at your physician's office. you can take a syringe (no needles!) and" b'fill it with warm water (cold can cause fainting) and otc hydrogen' b'peroxide. then point the ear towards the ceiling about degrees up)' b'and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and' b'firmly expell the solution. depending on the size of the syringe and the' b'tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses. if you place a bowl' b'under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier you can buy' b'a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever' b'you may have. if wax is old, it will be harder, and darker. you can try' b'adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up' b'the wax. do this for a couple days, then try syringing again. it is also' b'safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse' b'it out.' b'good luck' b'-heather'
