b'' b'' b'i understand that the new gps boxes now have an option' b'known as "differential ready". apparently land-based' b'beacons tranmit gps correction information to your gps' b'receiver (with differential option installed).' b'' b'how does this system work? what frequency is used for' b'the land-based beacons?' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'' b'charlie thompson' b'.' b'' b"here's a rough sketch of how the system works. a reference station" b'with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the' b'incoming gps signals. these errors are due to several factors' b'including atmospheric distortion, sa (selective availability) time' b'dithering, etc. the reference unit contains complex computational' b'equipment to "back out" the errors in its position (since it knows' b'where it is already). it then transmits these corrections on a' b'broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local' b'receivers. if the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using' b'the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very' b'similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit. thus, the' b'receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference' b'unit.' b'' b'the us coast guard is currently (as far as i know) installing a series' b'of coastline transmitters for differential gps. these stations will' b'use existing radio towers. i believe the frequency is to be approximately' b'305 khz. there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals' b'on different frequencies. for example, pinpoint offers' b'correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system' b'which has stations all across the us.' b'' b'the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm format.' b'advertised accuracies espouse to meter errors.' b'' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b"john p. baker my opinions are my own. i don't know" b'johns hopkins university anyone else who wants them, anyway.' b'applied physics laboratory\t|' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------'
