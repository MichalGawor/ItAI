b'' b'' b' point of view, why does scsi have an advantage when it comes to multi-' b' tasking? data is data, and it could be anywhere on the drive. can' b' scsi find it faster? can it get it off the drive and into the computer' b' faster? does it have a better cache system? i thought scsi was good at' b' managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached. if we are' b' only talking about a single drive, explain why scsi is inherently' b' faster at managing data from a hard drive.' b'' b'the adaptec 1540-series use bus mastering. this means that the cpu' b"doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other" b'computing if you have an advanced multi-tasking os, that is. dos' b'just sits and waits anyway.' b'' b'' b' ide: integrated device electronics' b' currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for' b' medium sized drives. can have more than one hard drive.' b' asynchronous transfer: ~5mb/s max.' b'' b" why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bus first?" b" you can quote scsi specs till you're blue in the face, but if they" b" exceed the isa bus capability, then what's the point?" b'' b' who says ide is limited to megs/sec? what about vlb-ide? does anyone' b' know how they perform?' b'' b"why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bus first? ide" b'was designed to plug into isa virtually unaided in essence, ide *is*' b"isa, on a ribbon cable. therefore it's specs are the same as isa b'8mhz clock, bit width, 5mb/sec.' b'' b"this is why i've concluded that ide on vl-bus is a waste of a fast" b"slot. the card's job would to slow the vl-bus transactions to isa" b"speed. heck, that's what isa slots do i'll just use one of those" b'instead.' b'--' b'os/2 will do for me until amigados for the comes along...'
