b'' b'the tachometer has a sticker right on it that says "for the first b"miles do not go over rpm's, and for the next miles, don't go" b"over (referred to as the break-in period if you didn't know.)" b'' b'well, if i were to do that, i would never be going over mph even in' b'6th gear!!! so my question is, will it hurt my new cycle to take it up' b'in the rpm range so that i can at least go the speed limit????' b'' b'but you already can go at the speed limit at rpm. all you need' b'to do is to find a road with a mph speed limit.' b'' b"this isn't quite as silly as it sounds. if you take a nice day trip" b'over back roads (*not* highways full of people trying seriously to get' b'from here to there) then you might be able to hold mph comfortably.' b'you could easily do miles over three different weekends. you' b'might even get to enjoy some of the scenery. yes, i know this is' b'probably not why you bought a called "ninja."' b'' b"-- bmw r65 dod also bmwmoa, nra, aclu, et al." b'' b''
