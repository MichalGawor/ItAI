b'' b'as for my impressions of the whole scheme it seems that instead of trying to' b'ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. their contention that they' b'need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key' b'registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. more likely' b'is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont' b'have the keys registered. anyone else notice that in their q&a session, they' b'' b'preventing black market chips w/non-escrowed keys is exactly what they' b'mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system. there are' b'two parts to the security of such a system:' b'' b'(a) preventing decruption by unauthorized personel' b'(b) assuring that the gummit can always decrypt clipper' b'traffic when it authorizes itself to do so.' b'' b'of course, the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about' b'(a) and very little about (b).' b'' b'rob boudrie' b'' b"ps: anyone care to guess what encryption scheme the gov't is using on" b'its newly formed database of anarch-cryptists who oppose this entire' b'lunacy?' b''
