b'' b"he doesn't contradict himself. the church is to last for all time." b'however, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves. this' b'is evident in many letters. for instance, paul talks about the' b'"super-apostles" to the corinthians corinthians he mentions' b'how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders b'thessalonians he tells timothy that it is clear that some will' b'abandon the faith and teach lies timothy and that some will' b'search for teachers to suit what they want to hear timothy b'such passages go throughout the letters and jesus does warn about them' b'(matthew but look at the promise in this last part. verse' b'14: "and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world' b'as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." even today,' b'there are false teachings. i can name two which i am well familiar' b'with: the non-need of baptism and the "praying of jesus into your life' b'for salvation". both are taught. both are dead wrong. they have been' b'taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just' b'plain made up. the only way jesus taught is given in luke and' b'luke he then commands baptism in matthew the' b"church jesus founded, though, is alive and well. it's not being" b"persecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is" b'being persecuted.' b'' b'joe fisher' b'' b'' b'peace,' b'lou' b'' b'+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++' b'+ ps ps dn ml b'+ ad altare dei ad deum qui laetificat juventutem meam b'+ 1cor mt 1cor luke b'+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++'
