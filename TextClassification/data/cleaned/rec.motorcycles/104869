b'' b'hello folks,' b'i\'m very happy with my "new" r80gs. my range is miles on gallons...' b"that's mpg!! surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser. i was expecting" b"something rough. she's a sweet backroad honey. and i can go pretty much" b"anyplace i'd take my mountain bike. as far as shaft effect, it's more a" b'torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion. rev it sitting still' b'(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit. maybe' b"i don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion" b'' b'not to start *another* shaft effect discussion, but the twist you' b'feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger fly-wheels that' b"the bmw r-bikes (maybe k's too, dunno) use. if you whack the throttle" b"at stop lights, it'll really rock the bike over (to the right)." b'' b'<snip \t<snip' b'2) i run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the' b"crash bar. the illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming" b'out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so' b'that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it' b'really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.) combined with the' b"headlamp on high you can see like day. but i've heard that bmw alternators" b"don't crank out too much. do i need to shut down the sidelamp when i'm" b'puttering around in the dirt at low rpm?' b'' b'please post if you come to any conclusion on this. i am thinking' b'of putting a light on each cylinder guard on my r100s, and was' b'wondering whether i was going to have to switch lights off every' b'time i was under rpm b'' b"| kawi zephyr (erik asphaug) b'' b'' b'-------' b'"this is where i wanna sit and buy you a drink someday." temple of the dog' b"'79 yamaha xs750f bmw r100s toyota 4runner nyc, ny.
