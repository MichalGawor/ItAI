b'' b'firstly, science has its basis in values, not the other way round.' b'so you better explain what objective atoms are, and how we get them' b'from subjective values, before we go any further.' b'' b'' b"atoms are not objective. they aren't even real. what scientists call" b'an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes' b'certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings. all' b'of which is subjective.' b'' b'what is objective, though, is the approach a scientist' b'takes in discussing his model and his observations. there' b'is no objective science. but there is an objective approach' b'which is subjectively selected by the scientist. objective' b'in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that' b'he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.' b'' b'this is in contrast to your objective morality. there may be an' b'objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on' b'morality. but there exists no objective morality.' b'' b'also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of' b'the physical world around us. in that the method of discussion' b'is objective not the science; not the discussion itself b'' b'science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes' b'of what we can observe. it simply gives us a way to discuss our' b'surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.' b'' b'i think it was neils bohr who said (to paraphrase) science is what' b'we can _say_ about the physical world.' b'' b'-jim halat'
