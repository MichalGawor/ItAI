b'' b'the other day, it was raining cats and dogs, therefor i was going only to' b'the speed limit, on nothing more, on my bike. this guy in his bmw was' b'driving meters behind me for meters and at the next red light i' b'calmly put the bike on its leg, walked back to this car, he rolled down the' b'window, and i told him he was a total idiot (and the reason why).' b'' b'did i do the right thing?' b'' b'yours truly b'' b' niels mikkel' b'yesss! you make me proud to' b"be an 'merkun. good thing you" b"didn't get shot though. don't" b"try that with a good'ole boy in texas." b'i once had a jeep driver south of conroe cut me off (i was' b'in my car) after i had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic' b'and senseless. all lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks' b'back (he is blocking all traffic between dallas and houston since the' b'freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, "stick that' b"finger out again and i'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your" b'sorry-ass throat." i stared straight ahead, unblinking. a hundred' b'cars were honking. eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red' b'with anger, and all the rest of the way back to houston i tailed him,' b"waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling... i'm glad he decided" b'not to shoot me.' b'/-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\' b'| b"| kawi zephyr (erik asphaug) b"| bmw r100gs\t\t\t\t\t\t b'\\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/'
