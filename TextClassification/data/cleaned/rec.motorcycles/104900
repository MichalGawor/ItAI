b'' b'another to the list but with this one i felt the most helpless. i am sitting' b'at a light about car lengths behind a car, a wise decsion. suddenly i' b"hear screeching tires. i dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the" b'moroon flying up right behind me, in my panic i pop my clutch and stall the' b'bike. luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel.' b'' b'i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you' b'really in actuality avoid such an incident? suggestions?' b'' b"i've only ever done it in an automatic. i was sitting in my olds, in" b'the winter, at a light, when i heard screeching behind me. i managed to' b'dart into the left turn lane before the sliding jetta wound up half' b"where i was and half in the parked car beside where i was. i've never" b'had occasion to do it on a bike, but i imagine that it would be even' b'easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. giving a gander' b'at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch' b'out smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the' b'screeching.' b'' b"i've bike like jody levine dod kv" b'ride it toronto, ontario, canada'
