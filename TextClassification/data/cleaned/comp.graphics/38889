b'' b'' b'' b"rhi've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes" b'rhpositioned carefully) to a .3ds file that when you reload it after restarting' b'rh3ds, they are given a default position and orientation. but if you save' b'rhto a .prj file their positions/orientation are preserved. does anyone' b'rhknow why this information is not stored in the .3ds file? nothing is' b'' b' this is because the prj (project) format saves all of your settings,' b" right down to the last render file's name." b'' b"rhi'd like to be able to read the texture rule information, does anyone have" b'rhthe format for the .prj file?' b'' b" sorry... don't have anything on that or the cel format." b'' b'well, i dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .prj file as much' b'as i needed to extracted the mapping icon information which is' b'when it dawned on me that 3d studio is useless for my needs. i need' b'a mapping icon per applied texture. i want to use a special purpose' b'graphics computer for rendering the 3ds models and it requires a texture' b'rule/plane to be specified in 3space, i.e. position/orientation of the' b'mapping rule. since only one mapping icon is used in 3ds to apply' b'textures to all objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3ds totally' b'unsuitable for my needs.' b'' b'anyone got a contact for alias upfront or any other good modeller for a' b'pc? i must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this' b"must be saved in a file which i can read. i haven't found any info on alias" b'in the copy of the faq that i have.' b'' b'rych'
