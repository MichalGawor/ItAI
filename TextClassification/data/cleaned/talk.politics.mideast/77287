b'' b'' b' this is not a fresh case of' b'ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga' b'of intense mutual hatred, destruction,...' b'' b'every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and' b'destruction. the holocaust was not a "fresh case." it was another' b"chapter in a year history of attacks on jews in europe. that didn't" b'make it acceptable. and balkan history does not make the genocide against' b'bosnian muslims acceptable.' b'' b'i guess that it was not acceptable because germany *also* chose' b'a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of' b'other countries in peril. i wonder whether us or other countries' b'would have risked themselves if only jews were persecuted and' b'hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (i am no student of history' b'and i am just asking questions.)' b'' b'if even for a moment you think that i am condoing ethnically' b'motivated violence and killings, you are dead wrong. let me' b'assure i am not. my only question is this: do powerful countries' b'have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if' b'their own interests are not threatened. i cite an essay by' b'charles krauthammer in the time (this week) that discusses' b'this issue eloquently.' b'' b'for example, did us and other european countries abandon their' b'moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops' b'to bombay when hindus, in a rare fit of impassioned rage, killed' b'many muslims recently. i think not!' b'' b'under what conditions should us interfere in foregin countries,' b'is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious' b'accusations of religious bigotry and such.' b'' b'satya prabhakar' b'--'
