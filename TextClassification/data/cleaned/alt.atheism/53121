b'' b' what about the twelve imams, who he considered incapable of error' b' or sin? khomeini supports this view of the twelve imans. this is' b' heresy for the very reasons i gave above.' b'' b'i would be happy to discuss the issue of the imams with you, although' b'my preference would be to move the discussion to another' b'newsgroup. i feel a philosophy' b'or religion group would be more appropriate. the topic is deeply' b'embedded in the world view of islam and the' b'esoteric teachings of the prophet (s.a.). heresy does not enter' b'into it at all except for those who see islam only as an exoteric' b'religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical' b"substance of man's being and nature." b'' b'a good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory' b'books to islam in general) is murtaza mutahhari\'s "fundamental\'s' b'of islamic thought god, man, and the universe" mizan press,' b'translated by r. campbell. truly a beautiful book. a follow-up book' b'(if you can find a decent translation) is "wilaya the station' b'of the master" by the same author. i think it also goes under the' b'title of "master and mastership" it\'s a very small book really' b'just a transcription of a lecture by the author.' b'the introduction to the beautiful "psalms of islam" translated' b'by william c. chittick (available through muhammadi trust of' b'great britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. we' b'have these books in our university library i imagine any well' b'stocked university library will have them.' b'' b'from your posts, you seem fairly well versed in sunni thought. you' b"should seek to know shi'ite thought through knowledgeable" b"shi'ite authors as well at least that much respect is due before the" b'charge of heresy is levelled.' b'' b'as salaam a-laikum'
