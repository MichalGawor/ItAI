b'' b'' b' resolving power of the optics. batse is an altogether different' b' beast, effectively just coincidence counters, one on each corner of' b' the craft. positional information is triangulated from the' b' differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.' b'' b'obviously not. count rates are too low and signal rise times too long' b"for this to be possible. the cgro, is, what, meters long? you'd" b'need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this.' b'' b'what batse actually does is measure the relative strength in each of' b'the detectors (also as a function of photon energy). each of the' b'detectors does not have isotropic response. to do this right one must' b'model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector,' b"and even scattering of photons off the earth's atmosphere back onto" b'the spacecraft. i believe they have now reduced the error to about b'degrees.' b'' b'paul f. dietz'
