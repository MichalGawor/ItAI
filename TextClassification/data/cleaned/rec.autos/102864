b'' b'i just visited the ny auto show, and saw two lh cars on the floor: eagle' b'vision and dodge intrepid.' b'' b'really nice i must say. very attractive styling, lots of features and room,' b'at a competitive price.' b'' b'unfortunately, the workmanship is quite disappointing. on both cars,' b'the rubber seals around the window and door fell off. it turns out' b'the seals are just big grooved rubber band. it goes on just by pressing' b'the groove against the tongue on the door frame. surely it would come' b'off easily.' b'' b'i am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering/assembly' b'problems that will show up later.' b'' b'i may still consider buying it, but only when it establishes a good' b'track record.' b'' b'jason chen'
