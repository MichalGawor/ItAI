b'' b'some years ago possibly as many as five there was a discussion on' b"numerology. (that's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add" b'up the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another. i can' b"never make any sense of how it's supposed to work or what it's supposed to" b'prove.)' b'' b'somebody posted a long article about numerology in the bible, saying' b'things like "this proves the intricate planning of the scriptures, else' b'these patterns would not appear".' b'' b'then there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the' b'other numerology posts. stuff like "the word `numerology\' adds up to b'and the word appears times in the posting! such elegant planning!' b"further, the word `truth' also adds up to the writer is using these" b'numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!"' b'(these examples are made up by me just as examples.)' b'' b'i really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showing' b'that these patterns can be found in just about anything. however, i did' b"not save a copy of it. i do not remember the author. i'm only sure" b'that it was posted to this newsgroup.' b'' b'but, on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it, or that the' b'author is reading here, i wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy. (i' b'think it should be made into an faq, if we can find it.)' b'' b'' b'"i use not only all the brains i have, but all those i can borrow as well."' b'-- woodrow wilson'
