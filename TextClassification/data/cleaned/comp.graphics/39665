b'' b'i currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any' b'standard format. they simply contain the 8-bit pixel values. i would' b'like to display these images on a pc. the conversion to a gif format' b'would be helpful. this conversion can take place either on a pc' b'or on a unix system and i could then download it to the pc.' b'can anyone suggest where i can find software to do this? alternatively, i' b'may have to write my own conversion program. in this case, could someone' b'tell me where i can find the gif format specification?' b'' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'' b''
