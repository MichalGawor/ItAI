b'' b'....' b'' b" i've read most of the history books dealing with this period," b' good and bad, and while it is possible that i missed one or two,' b" none of those i've read documents any razing of mosques. so i" b' think that this remarkable claim requires specific documentation.' b'' b' jake disrespectfully demands, and adam requires specific documentation' b' of the razing of mosques in jerusalem. if either of them had been' b' reading t.p.m for a while, they would already have seen such' b' documentation. for the forgetful or newcomers, however, here are the' b' references.' b'' b'thanks for posting the references. i do not normally read t.p.m.,' b"and i posted my request for references because jim's article" b'was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. allegations of jewish' b'disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are' b'one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and' b'rumors of church and host desacration probably caused more pogroms' b'than blood libel. the stereotypes that pervade our culture create' b'cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. therefore any' b'claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by' b'decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.' b'if such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has' b'not been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be' b'given the first time it appears. now that the claim has been' b'documented, i regard the whole episode as disgusting and' b'shameful. especially so because the official who failed to' b'provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted jordanians' b'was probably jewish, and as a jew i know that he should have' b'known better.' b''
