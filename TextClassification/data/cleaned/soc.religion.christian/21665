b'' b'' b'regarding the new draft of the universal catechism:' b'' b'\tin procuring the common good of society the need could arise' b'\tthat the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot' b'\tcause harm. by virtue of this, the right and obligation of' b'\tpublic authorities to punish with proportionate penalties,' b'\tincluding the death penalty, is acknowledged. b'\t... to the degree that means other than the death' b'\tpenalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the' b'\tpeace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred' b'\tbecause they are more in proportion and in keeping with the' b'\tfinal goal of protection of peace and human dignity.' b'' b'exactly!! read that one sentence in there..."to the degree' b'that means other than the death penalty and military operations are' b'sufficient to keep the peace, then these non-violent provisions are to' b'be preferred..."' b'' b"i don't believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep" b'the peace; the church in the united states feels the same way, thus the' b'reason that the catholic church has opposed every execution in this' b'country in recent memory.' b'' b"as is clearly shown by this excerpt, the church's teaching on capital" b'punishment remains today as it has always been in the past in total' b'accord with my sentiment that i do not disagree with the use of deadly' b'force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.' b'' b'so what is justifiable? as you stated very explicitly from the new' b'catechism, the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep' b'the peace. since that does not apply *at all* to this country, the' b'logical conclusion (based on your own premises) is that one must be' b'opposed to *any* form of capital punishment in america.' b'' b'' b'just my opinions.' b'mike walker' b'univ. of illinois'
