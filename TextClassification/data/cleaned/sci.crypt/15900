b'' b" i've recently been reading a paper of merkle's (publixhed only on the" b'net, i think) discussing three potential replacements for des. was' b'anyting ever done with these? are khufu, khafre, and/or snefru still' b'being discussed anywhere? (i know snefru is referenced in the rsa' b'faq, and i think it may also be in the sci.crypt faq.)' b' on a related topic, can anyone point me toward good sites to find' b"papers/articles/discussions of cryptology? i think i've about exhausted" b"the math/sci library here, which doesn't seem to have anything more recent" b"than about b'' b' thanks.' b'' b' --john kelsey' b'' b'khufu and khafre are both patented biham and shamir showed' b'that differential cryptanalysis can break 16-round khafre with a chosen-' b'plaintext attack using different encryptions. khafre with rounds' b'can be broken with the same attack using different encryptions.' b'(there are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks, if' b'someone wants to take the time to look.)' b'' b'khufu has key-dependent s-boxes, and is immune to differential cryptanalysis.' b'source code for this algorithm (and khafre) are in the patent.' b'' b'snefru is a public-domain one-way hash function. the version of snefru' b'that produces a 128-bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis' b'(vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force) for' b'four passes or less. given that, sha and md5 are much more efficient.' b'' b'oh yes, anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact dave petre,' b'director of patent licencing for xerox, b'' b'bruce'
