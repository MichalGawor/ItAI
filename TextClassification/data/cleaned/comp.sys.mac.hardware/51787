b'' b'' b'' b'a friend asked me to build a cable to connect an hp fetal heart monitor' b'to a maciontosh (se/30). no problem, sez i.' b'' b'...' b"i wanted to demo it on my pb it won't work!" b'' b'the pb has been used running zterm and kermit using both internal and external' b"modems; so i don't think it's the powerbook per se." b'' b'when i send a to the hp it responds with "^55^aa" a test of the serial' b'ports. it works on the se/30; but not on the pb170.' b'' b'i thought that the se/30 is connected to earth ground and so is the hp. so i' b'connected from the chassis of the hp to the pw audio (ground) connector; still' b'ng.' b'' b'any thoughts?' b'' b'battery powered devices like the powerbook are sometimes more sensitive to' b'serial port weirdness. i had trouble with connecting my mac plus to an hp 95lx' b'handheld. everything else worked okay on that port, but not the hp. (it runs' b'on two penlite batteries). it turned out that the plus (by accident or by' b'design flaw?) was putting a volt bias on the serial port that was doing' b'weird things to the hp (which has only 3v dc!). the hp worked fine when' b'connected to the printer port.' b'' b'does your pb screen get dim or anything when connected to the device? have you' b'tried using the printer port?' b'' b'good luck.' b'' b'--jamie' b'' b'' b'harris space systems corp.
