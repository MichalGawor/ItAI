b'' b'' b"\ti have a new scope and i thought i'd save a few bucks by" b'buying one with a function generator built in.' b'' b'hmm... now where was that ad for the combination radio/hand cranked' b'generator/flashlight/siren i saw? b'' b"[function generator has a 50mv offset, and the amplitude's too high]" b'' b'\tis there any way i could make myself a little box that could' b'solve this little problem. the box would tkae the function generator' b'input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some' b'low, unchanging number. i would want to lower the voltage by a factor' b"of one hundred or so. i could just build a little buffer amp, but i'd" b'like to have this box not be active.' b'' b"sure, you've already got the right idea." b'' b'ignoring the ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just' b'run it into, say, a voltage divider made of ohms in series with b'ohms. this new circuit is the thevenin equivalent of one that puts out' b'1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly' b'less than ohms. you may want to monkey with the values a little' b'depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or' b'the availability of parts.' b'' b'hows that sound?' b'' b'---joel kolstad' b'' b'p.s. this is why those high voltage probes for multimeters can be' b'accurate but still cheap. they have something like megs in series with' b"100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as" b'keeping the (probably meg impedance) multimeter happy.'
