b'' b'...his account that is.' b'' b'many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here' b'on the net on a daily basis. i have just been informed of what i feel is' b'one of the most important things that we could ever discuss the' b'out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people' b"don't like what he says or thinks." b'' b'we have all seen the postings here by aj teel. although many of us have' b"not agreed with their content, i'm sure most of us have been at least" b'somewhat interested in them. i, for one, am greatful to live (i thought)' b'in a country where people like mr. teel are allowed to say what they please.' b"if i don't wan't to read it, i can just skip on by, or unsuscribe. but," b'unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live. they feel' b'an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards. now it seems that' b'mr. teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif' b'net police, ted frank.' b'' b'' b'please help aj teel regain net (post) access and correct this injustice.' b'' b"are you on ted's hit list?" b'are your thoughts correct?' b'is your account safe?' b'has your sysadmin been contacted by the thought police?' b'' b'i thought the nlg and the aclu supported people with diverse opinions. not!' b'' b'' b'please read the following forwarded messages from aj teel so that' b'you may understand this vial act for what it is...' b'' b'------------------------------ forwarded b'' b'newsgroups: alt.activism,alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc,misc.legal' b'summary: ted wins the argument by killing his opponent!' b'expires:' b'followup-to: alt.conspiracy' b'distribution:' b'organization: university of colorado, boulder' b'keywords: nwo ted frank' b'' b'i guess that the information i am presenting is just toooo difficult' b'for them to deal with. they (only ted and mark) have complained to my' b'sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (in his' b'defense, mark sent only one message and it was not that bad; it has' b'been posted in one of the newsgroups; however, it *was* not directed' b'at me as would be common practice and i am very good at responding' b'via netmail...)' b'' b'while i disagree with ted, i would not send mail to his sysadmin' b'to get him axed. name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post' b'i made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not' b'what the desired picture was not enough; simply ignoring me if i' b'am such a kook was not enough. even now i do not wish to have him' b'axed, but i do wish to express my disgust about this. "argumentum' b'ad silence-your-opponent-um"?! i would have thought he would have' b'wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and' b'seem sooo wise... (to himself, i think).' b'' b'the issue that seems to be: "is the following an advertisement?"' b'apparently, ted and mark think so...' b'' b'1) i posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken' b'*off the net* from last year. if reposting an article' b'constitutes posting an ad, then i am guilty. this post' b'did have a name and address and, yes, a price. if one' b'had posted the address and subscription price of "newsweek",' b'would that be an ad? i get nothing from showing this stuff.' b'2) i posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of' b'"proof" that was requested by ted frank. he then complains' b'to my sysadmin saying that i am advertising and, lo and' b'behold, "poof", there goes my account. this one had an' b'address in it! oh, no! i guess that means it is an ad!' b'' b'if you value the alternative view i have been discussing, or value' b'its discussion even if you do not agree with it, i ask that you send' b'a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. they rarely get' b'"ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they' b'only get "i don\'t like what that user is doing because...".' b'please do not send the note to the sysadmin. i need to take it to them' b'in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.' b'' b'in my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "thanks for' b'the info" or "could you send me such and such?" or "your posts are' b'very interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "go aways". but,' b'i guess the fact that i have decided not to waste my time trying to' b'convince ted is a net offense[tm] of such magnitude as to warrant' b'a message complaining about me. (knock, knock..."my name is ted and' b"and this is mark... we're from the thought police. seems you have" b'some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we\'re here to confiscate them...")' b'nwo indeed!' b'' b'guess i will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with' b'a new plan... thanks ted and mike. hope you are happy.' b"i will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!" b'your comments and support are requested. i can no longer post' b'to news. i ask what this has accomplished... is there some benefit' b'from making alternative views simply vanish? not in my book.' b'seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side' b'shut up. images of waco.... ah, but alas... and all this when i am in the' b'process of typing in a letter to me from the tax collector saying that' b'a lien was removed due to a letter that i wrote challenging jurisdiction.' b'oh, well... it takes time to come up with the info requested, and i' b'was just getting started.' b'' b'it should be noted that ted frank has been accused publicly over b'times of being an nwo supporter and has never made an statements to the' b"contrary. further, what are ted frank's motivations for getting me axed?" b'we all know that some people are getting paid to collect info on people' b'on the net that are of "interest" to the government, and ted sure seems' b'to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. hmmm... just who does' b'he work for? the university of chicago which he "attends"(?) is well' b'known as one of the biggest nwo supporters...' b'' b'and finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here' b'in the boulder/denver area, i would greatly appreciate it. i am in the' b'process of installing linux and so will be able to do uucp or maybe' b'a tc/ip connection. any help here would be greatly appreciated. since i' b'am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email very' b'soon, i hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:' b'' b'a. j. teel, sui juris' b'c/o usps box b'boulder, colorado, u.s.a.' b'postal zone: b'' b'or leave me voice mail at: c/o b'' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'selected messages from ted frank via sysadmin follows:' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'with explicit reservation of all rights (u.c.c. b'' b'' b'---------------------------' b'' b'received: from locutus.cs.colorado.edu by dendrite.cs.colorado.edu with smtp id aa14777' b'received: by locutus.cs.colorado.edu with smtp id aa15908' b'(5.65c/ida-1.4.4 for <ajteel); mon, apr b'in-reply-to: your message of mon, apr cdt' b'date: mon, apr b'status: or' b'' b'--------' b'' b'please ask to stop advertising his wares on the network. thank you.' b"[editor's note: b'' b'[start of document: doclist.txt.lis b'documents now available' b'' b'bill medina, sui juris' b'post office box b'sunnyvale, california, u.s.a.' b'postal zone: b'' b'(79 lines deleted).' b'' b'---------------' b'resolution:' b'---------------' b'' b'thank you. he has been warned before. we are taking action.' b'' b'' b'barbara j. dyker department of computer science' b'manager, computer operations campus box 430b, ecee00-69' b'(303) boulder, co b'' b'--------------------' b'.cs.colorado.edu mon apr b'received: from locutus.cs.colorado.edu by dendrite.cs.colorado.edu with smtp id aa15809' b'received: by locutus.cs.colorado.edu id aa16069' b'(5.65c/ida-1.4.4 for ajteel); mon, apr b'date: mon, apr b'received: by next.mailer b'received: by next mailer b'status: or' b'' b'[...]' b'' b'i had already warned you that your inappropriate use of' b'your account here must stop. you have used your account' b'here as a soapbox for your political "sui juris" agenda.' b'' b'[...]' b'' b' date: tue, mar b'' b'' b' also, if you are reported for any more commercial' b' announcements, your account may be disabled.' b'' b"[editor's note: what commercial advertisemnets are we talking about?]" b'' b' date: tue, mar mst' b'' b'' b'[...]' b'' b' as long as' b" they aren't causing any problems, we typically don't" b' mind. ...we have received two complaints about the' b' content of your messages so far (at least one of which i' b' consider valid) which already constitutes excessive' b" in my book. just don't let it happen again." b'' b"[editor's note: i *wonder* who the other post was from??!]" b'' b'' b'in-reply-to: your message of wed, mar cst' b'date: thu, mar mst' b'' b'--------' b'' b'bounced names:' b'' b'hello all:' b' i am having trouble reaching the following (keeps bouncing).' b" if you sent me mail and haven't gotten a response, check here." b' also, can anyone tell me why these are bouncing?
