b'' b'' b'it is actually simple in principle. porous adsorbents like zeolite and' b'activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water' b'or methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect. upon being heated, the' b'gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be' b'condensed. this forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle. the only problem' b'is that the cop is very low b'' b'max' b'' b'--' b'school of mpe, nanyang technological university phone: b'nanyang avenue, singapore 2263\t\t\t| fax:
