b'' b'' b'come to think of it, though, i hear and see a lot of complaints about' b'the ati boards too, though recent word looks like the build code looks' b'much better.' b'' b'' b'build still has a number of problems--sheared fonts, for' b'instance, if you have crystal fonts enabled. some other problems--' b'"color darkening" and some others. i don\'t use the drivers in' b'any mode other than 1024x768x256, so if there are bugs in the' b"other modes i can't say." b'' b'' b'does anyone have an accelerated video board with drivers for windows' b'(os/2?) where all the modes function properly? anyone? anyone?' b'' b'' b'to be honest, up until now, i have only found one bug in the' b'diamond viper drivers, and it seems innocuous.' b'' b'that is, under microsoft word, select format border, click' b'shading and take a look at the patterns. the pattern' b'has been swapped with the and so on. the whole list' b'is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take' b'it to another machine (i.e., a gup or ss24x machine) or' b'print it and iy shows--badly!' b'' b"keep in mind that i use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so i can't" b'speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty' b'solid.' b'' b'--' b'"what\'s big, noisy and has an iq of b'' b'"operation rescue."'
