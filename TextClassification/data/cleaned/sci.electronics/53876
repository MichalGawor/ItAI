b'' b'hey all:' b'' b'i just moved to nyc and wondered if there are any electronics hackers' b'out there who could point me to places in nyc that sell individual' b'electronic components (switches, pots, transformers, caps,' b'transistors, etc.) "radio shack" doesn\'t count (they have almost no' b'selection, and their prices are outrageous!)' b'' b"i have particular interest in audio components (amplifier ic's, power" b'mosfets, output transformers, tubes and tube sockets, pan pots,' b'faders, etc.)' b'' b'i have checked out a lot of 48th street and canal street so far with' b'no luck. am i missing places, looking in the wrong place, or do i' b'have to resort to mail order?' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'--fritzm.'
