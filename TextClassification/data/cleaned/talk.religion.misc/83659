b'' b'' b'| b"| it is true what you stated above: jesus' saving grace is available to" b'| everyone, not just jews. in other words, everyone can have salvation but' b'| not everyone will. this option is now open to people other than just' b"| jews. of course, if the jews don't accept the deity of christ, i would" b"| hardly expect them to accept anything that christ said. but i don't feel" b'| any animosity towards them. even though they persecuted jesus and his' b'| disciples and eventually crucified him, i bear them no ill will. if anything,' b'| i feel pity for them. jesus had to die to pay the price for our sins and' b'| so the jews were merely fulfilling prophesy. jesus knew he had to die even' b'| before he began his ministry. that demonstrates the great depth of his love' b'| for us.' b'|' b'| jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the' b'| children who died today at the davidian complex.' b'|' b'| sorry, but the events today made me even more negative concering' b'| organized religion.' b'|' b'' b'i understand and sympathize with your pain. what happened in waco was a very' b"sad tradgedy. don't take it out on us christians though. the branch" b'davidians were not an organized religion. they were a cult led by a ego-maniac' b'cult leader. the christian faith stands only on the shoulders of one man,' b'the lord of lords and king of kings, jesus christ. btw, david koresh was not' b'jesus christ as he claimed.' b'' b'god be with you,' b'' b'malcolm lee b'' b'| cheers,' b'| kent' b'|
