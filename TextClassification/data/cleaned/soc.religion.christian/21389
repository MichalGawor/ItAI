b'' b'' b'in all candor, i would be happy to be proven wrong [about believing' b'in atheism]. problem is, i will have to be _proven_ wrong.' b'' b'in mentioning some nonsense about psychology and atheism, bob muir asks' b'the following question.' b'' b'\tdo i sound "broken" to you?' b'' b'i answer in the affirmative. now this answer might sound a little' b'intellectually dishonest to bob, but i think i have been accused before' b'of that heinous crime and am man enough to take it. what thinking' b'person has not at one time or other been accused of it? is it' b'politically correct for christians to be the only besieged group' b'permitted the luxury of arrogance?' b'' b'now i have a question for bob. why in the world would any self-respecting' b'atheist want to subscribe to a christian news group? i have a' b'difficult enough time keeping up with it, and i think i know something' b'about the subject.' b'' b'bob reminds me of my roommate. in order to disbelieve atheism, he says' b"he will need to be proven wrong about it. well, i don't even waste" b"my time trying. i tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it." b'in response, he tells me he will say an "atheist\'s prayer" for me.' b'' b'good luck, bob. and, best regards.' b'' b'--' b'randal lee nicholas mandock' b'catechist'
