b'' b' as someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day' b' in texas.' b'' b' :do you eat all your food cold?' b'' b' minor quibble: the assualt (and it was one) began near dawn. the fire did' b' not break out for several hours. i find it highly unlikely that the bd would' b' be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are' b' pumping in tear gas.' b'' b"look, i don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves," b"but they're not anything like your caloric gas range. it takes about" b'three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards' b'you can\'t just "shut it off" it will contain hot embers for over b'hours even after you choke it completely.' b'' b'so it ain\'t exactly "light up the stove and cook me a batch of them' b'pancakes, aunt j..." if you use a woodstove for cooking, or even for' b'heating your house at night, you will have it lit to some extent all' b'the time. trust me on this one, i speak from experience.' b'--' b'' b''
