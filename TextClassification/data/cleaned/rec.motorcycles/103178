b'' b'| fight your ticket california edition by david brown 1st ed.' b'| berkeley, ca nolo press, b'| b"| the second edition is out (but not in ucb's library). good luck; let" b'| us know how it goes.' b'| b'| daniel matejka writes:' b'' b"| can you beat this ticket? personally, i think it's your duty as a citizen" b"| to make it as much trouble as possible for them, so maybe they'll give up" b'| and leave us alone someday soon.' b'| the cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing' b'| your speed. mr. brown (the author of fight your ticket) mentions an' b'| oakland judge who convicted a speeder "on the officer\'s testimony that' b'| the driver\'s car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed."' b'' b'*cough* *choke* what?!? if a cop gave me a ticket for "sounding" like' b"i was speeding i'd probably show up in court without a lawyer simply" b'because "sounding" like speeding is ridiculous. if i was found guilty' b"i'd appeal and then show up with a lawyer." b'' b"if a cop doesn't do one of:" b'' b'vascar (from car or plane)' b'radar, lidar, other electronic speed measuring device' b'pace me' b'' b"and i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go to court. i can accept a" b'cop "seeing" me going excessively fast (like over the limit) but' b'"he looked like he was going or so in a zone" is not "beyond a' b'reasonable doubt". granted i may well lose the case but in a measured' b'by eye??? take it to court for sure.' b'' b'axel' b''
