b'' b'acetone will likely damage the carpet. first solvent to try is denatured' b'alcohol. do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol. you can use methyl' b'alcohol instead of denatured alcohol. if you want to have a cocktail while' b'you are removing the goo, use pure grain alcohol if the alcohol does' b'not work try carbon tetrachloride. if neither of these work you may need to' b'try a stronger solvent, but the alcohol works for most adhesives. good luck.' b'' b'jim'
