b'' b'i am a novice (at best) in working with pc networks, and am in the' b'process of planning a small accounting system for a small business.' b'' b'the particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a' b'different office of the same building, each having access to a' b'windows-based accounting system.' b'' b'my first thought is to set up ms windows for workgroups on each of the' b"machines (likely a and two 386's) along with the appropriate ethernet" b'cards and cabling that come with the windows for workgroups starter kit (one' b'additional user kit will be necessary). it then seems logical to purchase' b'a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of daceasy or' b'm.y.o.b., and fire it all up! the will more or less act as server with' b'a report/check printer attached to it.' b'cable runs of feet will be necessary for this setup.' b'' b'well, this all seems too easy to me. would any of you network gurus out' b'there tell me if i am out of my mind here? any and all suggestions, however' b'trivial, will be immensely appreciated. my apologies if this has been' b'brought up before.' b'' b'thanks!' b'' b'john' b'--' b'--'
