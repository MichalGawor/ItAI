b'' b'' b'...the same kind of ignorance is demonstrated in just about every post' b'in this newsgroup. for instance, generalizations about christianity' b'are popular.' b'' b'which newsgroup have you been reading? the few anti-christian posts are' b'virtually all in response to some christian posting some "you will all' b'burn in hell" kind of drivel.' b'' b"i'm a soft atheist (courtesy of the faq), but even i know enough about" b'the bible to see that it repeatedly warns of false prophets preaching' b'in the name of god.' b'' b'bake, it is transparently obvious that you are a theist pretending to be' b'an atheist. you probably think you are very clever, but we see this all' b'the time.' b'' b'but the possibilities of creator and eternity carry with them too much' b'emotional power to dismiss merely on the basis of this line.' b'' b'but of course *you* have dismissed them because you are an atheist,' b'right?' b'' b'...just like any other religion, hard atheism is a faith.' b'' b"in other words, you *didn't* read the faq after all." b'' b'this is patently absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher' b'must learn not to be frightened by absurdities. bertrand russell'
