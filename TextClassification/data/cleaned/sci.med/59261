b'' b'the following article by columnist mike royko is his humorous commentary' b"on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries." b'i hope some of you will find it as amusing as i did.' b'' b'____________________________________________________________________________' b'[reprinted w/o permission]' b'' b'' b'"there\'s no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors\' salaries"' b'' b'by mike royko' b'tribune media services' b'' b'' b"on a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings" b'is right up there. it almost scored a perfect brain-dead b'it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called' b'families usa.' b'the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe' b'that doctors make too much money.' b'the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for' b'physicians. those polled said, oh, about a year would be' b'ok.' b'how generous. how sporting. how stupid.' b'why is this poll stupid? because it is based on resentment' b'and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign' b'and are still simmering.' b'you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that' b'earns $100,000-plus and get the same results. since the majority' b"of americans don't make those bucks, they assume that those who" b'do are stealing it from them.' b"maybe the berlin wall came down, but don't kid yourself." b'karl marx lives.' b"it's also stupid because it didn't ask key questions, such" b'as: do you know how much education and training it takes to' b'become a physician?' b"if those polled said no, they didn't know, then they should" b'have been disqualified. if they gave the wrong answers, they' b'should have been dropped. what good are their views on how much' b"a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a" b'doctor?' b'or maybe a question should have been phrased this way: "how' b'much should a person earn if he or she must (a) get excellent' b'grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order' b'to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking' b'courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and' b'maintain a average or better, and (c) spend four more years' b'of grinding study in medical school, with the third and fourth' b'years in clinical training, working to hours a week, and' b'(d) spend another year as a low-pay, hard-work intern, and (e)' b'put in another three to years of post-graduate training,' b'depending on your specialty and (f) maybe wind up in' b'debt after medical school and (g) then work an average of b'hours a week, with many family doctors putting in hours or' b'more until they retire or fall over?"' b'as you have probably guessed by now, i have considerably' b'more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and' b'clinton, and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have' b"called together to remake america's health care." b'based on what doctors contribute to society, they are far' b'more useful than the power-happy, ego-tripping, program-spewing,' b'social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is' b"to health what clinton's first budget is to frugality." b'but propaganda works. and, as the stupid poll indicates,' b'many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the' b'major cause of high medical costs.' b'of course doctors are well-compensated. they should be.' b'americans now live longer than ever. but who is responsible for' b'our longevity--lawyers, congress, or the guy flipping burgers in' b"a mcdonald's?" b'and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become' b'a nation of self-indulgent, lard-butted, tv-gaping couch' b'cabbages.' b'ah, that is not something you heard president clinton or' b'super spouse talk about during the campaign or since. but' b'instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain,' b'they might have been more honest if they had said:' b'"let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest' b'problems we have. that problem is you, my fellow american. yes,' b'you, eating too much and eating the wrong foods; many of you' b'guzzling too much hooch; still puffing away at a pack;' b'getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the' b'microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into' b'the world; filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot' b'victims; engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease' b'while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.' b'"you and your habits, not the doctors, are the single' b'biggest health problem in this country. if anything, it is' b'amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.' b'"in fact, i don\'t understand how they can stand looking at' b'your blubbery bods all day.' b'"so as your president, i call upon you to stop whining and' b'start living cleanly. now i must go get myself a triple cheesy-' b'greasy with double fries. do as i say, not as i do."' b'but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid,' b"there is another solution: don't use them." b"that's right. you don't feel well? then try one of those" b'spine poppers, needle twirlers, or have rev. bubba lay his hands' b'upon your head and declare you fit.' b'or there is the do-it-yourself approach. you have chest' b'pains? then sit in front of a mirror, make a slit here, a slit' b'there, and pop in a couple of valves.' b"you're going to have a kid? why throw your money at that" b'overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house' b'than you will ever have (while paying more in taxes and' b'malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?' b'just have the kid the old-fashioned way. squat and do it.' b'and if it survives, you can go to the library and find a book on' b'how to give it its shots.' b'by the way, has anyone ever done a poll on how much' b'pollsters should earn?' b'' b'' b'royko is a pulitzer prize-winning columnist for tribune media' b'services.' b'' b'____________________________________________________________________________' b'' b'' b'--' b'**********************************************' b'**********************************************' b''
