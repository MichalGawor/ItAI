b'' b'' b"today's atrocity in waco has finally impelled me to start working on" b"something i've been thinking about for some time. over the last few" b'years i have heard of one case after another of government running' b'completely amok. unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the' b"government's crimes and still think of it as their protector. so i" b'intend to put together what i call the "american horror file": a' b'compilation of cases where the american government has run roughshod' b'over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing' b'especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,' b'and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,' b'but including any other cases for which i can find decent' b'documentation. i hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,' b'red-hot enraged at their government.' b'' b'the end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ascii text' b"and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent" b'years. this book will be distributed at cost, and i will encourage' b"people to post copies to bbs's, send copies on disk to friends, and" b'print out copies and give them to neighbors.' b'' b'this is a call for your help. any information that you can send me on' b'how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated. i would prefer' b'information that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific' b'instances of governmental abuses. i also welcome anyone who wants to' b'join me in collecting and researching information for this project.' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'kevin s. van horn is your religion batf-approved?'
