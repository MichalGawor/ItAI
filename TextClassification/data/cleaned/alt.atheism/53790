b'' b'anyway, since i seem to be the only one following this particular line' b'of discussion, i wonder how many of the rest of the readership have' b'read this book? what are your thoughts on it?' b'' b'i read it when it first came out[...]' b'and i *liked* it. b'at the time i still "sorta-kinda" thought of myself as a muslim, and i' b"couldn't see what the flap was all about. b'' b'thank you. i now know at least that though i may be on drugs, at' b"least i'm not the only one." b'' b'the writing style was a little hard to get used to, but' b'it was well worth the effort. coming from a similar background (rushdie' b'grew up in bombay in a muslim family, and moved to england; i grew up in' b'new delhi), it made a strong impression on me. (and he used many of the' b'strange constructions of indian english: the "yaar" at the end of a' b'sentence, "butbutbut," the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)' b'' b'yes, this took some getting used to of course not having an indian' b'connection, no knowledge of hindi, etc., this was not trivial for me.' b'i did have, thanks to the wonders of the net, "a glossary to *satanic' b'verses*", posted to rec.arts.books by vijay raghavan, which explains a' b'lot of the indian english constructions, indian culture references,' b'even the islamic references ("jahilia", "submission", the context of' b'the satanic verses incident, etc.) what i have only covers the' b'first couple of hundred pages, but it helped me get into the flow of' b'the novel [i can mail this to anyone interested; if anyone has' b"portions after part i, if they exist, i'd like to get those]." b'--' b'these are my opinions. for a nominal fee, they can be yours.'
