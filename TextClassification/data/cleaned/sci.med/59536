b'' b'' b'i recently heard of some testing of a new migraine drug called' b'sumatripton (i have no idea of the actual spelling) that supposedly' b'utilizes a chemical that trips neuro-transmitters. my mother has' b'regular migraines and nothing seems to help does anyone know anything' b'about this new drug? is it in a testing phaze or anywhere near' b'approval? does it seem to be working?' b'' b'i just got back from the american academy of neurology annual meeting,' b'where the consensus was that sumatriptan (imitrex) has no advantages' b'over dhe-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side' b'effects, is as effective, and works more quickly minutes vs. b'besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal' b'spray works? dhe nasal spray is not widely available yet it has to' b'be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country but most' b'neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.' b'' b'this is patently absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher' b'must learn not to be frightened by absurdities. bertrand russell'
