b'' b": that's all very well and good, but i was refering to all" b': homocides, not just ones involving handguns (what is this fixation' b': on death by shooting, as if it were somehow worse than death' b': by stabbing?)' b'' b'what relevance are all homicides in this debate? what do you think gun' b'control advocates are saying: that if we get rid of all handguns we will' b'live in a homicide-free world?' b'' b"the relevance is that if you've got x homicides and reduce" b"the number of gun homicides in that group, but x doesn't decrease" b'by a significant amount, have you made an improvement, and is that' b"improvement worth what you've paid?" b'' b'the issue is guns, not baseball bats. even a simpleton knows that' b'he stands a better chance of surviving an attack with a baseball bat...' b'certainly of outrunning a bat-wielding assailant.' b'' b'if a baseball bat is a tenth as likely to kill a victim as a gun,' b'is that any comfort to that tenth?' b'' b"as for knives, see my earlier post. i'd much rather face a knife" b'than a gun, thanks.' b'' b"i've faced a knife. and i was damn annoyed i didn't *have*" b"a gun. all the statistics in the world didn't change the fact that" b'*he* was interested in cutting *me*.' b'' b"fortunately, the best defense against a knife isn't" b"another knife. anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have" b'much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife' b'assault (which probably means of knife assailants).' b'' b'"anyone trained in self-defense."' b'' b"unarmed self-defense isn't for everyone. what's more, it requires" b'substantially more training to be safe and effective than a firearm.' b'it requires physical proximity and thus a greater threat to the victim,' b'which is a primary problem with stun guns. you have to actually touch' b"your assailant. unless you're *very* good, a large, stronger assailant" b'can simply ignore your blows long enough to incapacitate you.' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group'
