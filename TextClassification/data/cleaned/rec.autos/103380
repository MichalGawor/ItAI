b'' b'i am considering the purchse of a vw jetta gli with 87k miles on it.' b'i recently found out that there are two versions of the gli 8v and 16v.' b'i know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same' b'name: the 16v version has more horsepower, wheel discs, and a standard' b'sunroof.' b"oops, that's the difference between the gli 16v and the regular gl b'so in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the' b'two models of the jetta gli b'more importantly, how can i tell which version this one is there are' b'no badges that said "16v" so i am inclined to think that is the 8v version.' b'assuming this one (the one i looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid' b'reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped gl which would cost less b'(of course i would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.)' b'' b'please email any responses. thank you.' b'peter volpe'
