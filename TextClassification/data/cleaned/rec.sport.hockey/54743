b'' b'while i will first congratulate the blues for their victory, i think it must' b'be realized that the primary reason the blues were able to win was curtis' b'joseph. when a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.' b'joseph should be given the entire city of st. louis, because otherwise there' b'would probably be a game scheduled.' b'' b'as for the game on sunday. the blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.' b'one was the referee constantly watching the blackhawks, looking for reasons to' b'give them penalties. second, the blues first goal resulted because the puck' b'hit the linesman as the blackhawks attempted to clear. no linesman, no shot' b"for brett(i can redirect anything)hull to redirect. on another of st. louis'" b'goals, belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone' b"who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a st. louis player." b'finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept belfour from getting back to the crease. no goalie, no way to stop the shot.' b'' b'i congratulate st. louis for beating the hawks. it will be a shame to see' b'bryan murray finally advance to the campbell conference finals because joseph' b"won't be able to stop the powerful red wing attack." b'' b'' b'____________________________________________________________________________' b'|known throughout the world as the bosk |"christ, you know it ain\'t easy,|' b'|all rights reserved, all lefts enhanced |you know how hard it can be, b"|-----------------------------------------|the way things are goin' b'|"here they come spinning out of the turn"|they\'re gonna crucify me" b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
