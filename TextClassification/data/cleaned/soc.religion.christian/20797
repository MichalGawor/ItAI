b'' b' muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the' b'fater of lies, satan. they need christ as do us all.' b'' b'my opinions are my own, you may borrow them' b'' b'just picked out this one point because it struck me....' b'why do you believe this? muslims believe in many of the same things' b'that christians and jews believe; they believe jesus, while not the' b'messiah, is a prophet. this seems to me to be much closer to' b'christianity than other religions are. (then again i tend to be' b"somewhat liberal about others' beliefs.)" b'' b'this also relates to the serbian "ethnic cleansing" question. i have' b'been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few. how' b'can we stand by and watch innocent people, even people whose beliefs' b"we condemn, if this is the case (and don't get me wrong, the things" b'fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil), be' b'tortured, raped (the stories about that made me physically ill), and' b'killed? jesus loves all, not just those who love him back and he' b'would advocate kindness toward them (in the hopes of converting them,' b"if that's the way you want to put it) rather than killing them." b'' b"i'm sorry i got off the subject here maybe i should have used a" b'different title. i did need to get this off my chest, however.' b'' b'peace (shalom),' b'vera shanti' b'_______________________________________________________________________________' b"doesn't seem so much\t\t\t(vera noyes)" b'hand over hand' b"is the strength of the common touch\tdrop me a line if you're in the mood" b'- rush, "hand over fist"' b'_______________________________________________________________________________' b'' b"[i am also worried about this issue. i've made a posting under my own" b'name earlier today. i do not much want to discuss moslem beliefs' b"here. this isn't the right group for it. their beliefs about jesus" b'appear to come as much from the koran as the bible. this means that' b'while they honor him, what they think he did and stood for differs in' b'many ways from christian beliefs about him. but moslem beliefs are' b'an appropriate topic for soc.religion.islam.' b'' b"as i'm sure you know, many christians believe that you must accept" b"christ in order to be saved. while stanley's comment appears to be" b'anti-moslem, i would assume he would say the same thing about all' b'religions other than christianity.' b'' b'--clh]'
