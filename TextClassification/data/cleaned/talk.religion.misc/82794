b'' b'' b'specifically: when i bring up the fact that genesis contains two' b'contradictory creation stories, i usually get blank stares or flat' b"denials. i've never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are" b'indeed two different accounts of creation.' b'' b'that is because two creation stories is one of the worst examples of' b'a difficulty with the bible. "were formed" can also be translated "had been' b'formed" in chapter two without any problems. so the text does not demand' b'that there are two creation stories.' b'' b"really? i don't get it... genesis first says that god created the" b'earth, then the animals, then humans; then it turns around and says' b'that humans were created before animals! how can you escape this' b'contradiction?' b'' b'--' b'_/_/_/ brian kendig je ne suis fait comme aucun' b"_/_/ n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent." b'/ the meaning of life si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre.' b'/ is that it ends. rousseau'
