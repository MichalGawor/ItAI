b'' b'' b'' b'i have just taken delivery on a new gm car (firebird) with a' b'clearcoat finish. i assume that it is probably urethane since the' b'industry has moved in that direction in paints.' b'' b'in years past, it used to be recommended that owners wait up to' b'60 days before you wax a car, for the paint to "cure." the dealer' b"shop manager said this also, but i'm not sure that he wasn't just" b'basing it on past tradition. does anyone know if this is still a' b'recommended practice, or is it better to go ahead and wax right' b'away (non-abrasive new car wax) with the newer finishes?' b'' b'--' b'terry quinn' b'germantown hills, il'
