b'' b'|' b'|' b'| the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to' b"| death, but i haven't seen anything in rsb yet." b'|' b'| gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two' b'| on and his club down by a run. he stroked a line drive into the' b'| right field corner. the ball cleared the three-foot high fence and' b'| went into the crowd. darryl, racing over from right center, got to' b'| the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he' b'| missed the ball. a fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,' b'| reached up and caught the ball. home run.' b'|' b"| now i've seen the replay several times and i have concluded that" b"| darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially" b"| behind darryl's. several dodger fans with seats in the immediate" b'| vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with' b'| strawberry. what cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan' b'| who caught the ball never took his eye off it; he was oblivious' b'| to where the fielder was playing. he was also quite exuberant as' b'| soon as he realized he had made the catch.' b'|' b'| [stuff about daryl and tommy and everyone blaming fan for the loss deleted]' b'' b'i saw the replay several times too. no question about it. daryl missed' b'the ball, *then* the fan caught it. daryl is so tall that he had the' b"first shot at the ball. daryl's just whining again. i think it shows a" b'lack of class when tommy, daryl and the dodgers blame a single fan for' b'losing the game. what about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball?' b'what about the pitchers that gave up runs up to that point? sorry, tommy.' b'if it were a game and daryl was feet inches tall, then maybe b"just maybe you'd have an argument."
