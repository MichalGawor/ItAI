b'' b'hey man! b'' b'having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a' b"couple of sessions of mock hockey, i'm ready to invest in hockey" b"equipment (particularly since i will be taking summer 'hockey" b"lessons'). however, i am completely and profoundly ignorant when it" b"comes to hockey equipment. i've checked out local stores and looked" b'at catalogs, but i was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before' b'actually plunking down any money. having played football in high' b'school and college i at least have that equipment as a basis for' b'comparison. but for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to' b'different kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles? are there any' b'notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles? etc. so any suggestions' b'or comments would be greatly appreciated.' b'' b'' b"tom menner \t \t \t i when you're swimming in the creek" b'software engineering institute\t i and an eel bites your cheek,' b"carnegie mellon university \t i that's a moray!" b'pittsburgh, pa\t \t \t i \t fabulous furry freak bros.' b'' b'' b''
