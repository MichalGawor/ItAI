b'' b'try the folks at dimolex corp., la crescenta, ca b'their number is they make membrane keypads' b'that are very flat, in layouts from to keys. they' b'have standard models, tactile models (with stainless domes' b"under each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well as" b'backlit models. some of them can even be cut with scissors' b'to form a funky shape other than a rectangle. many of the' b"models are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel," b'colored and plain key covers, and rub on lettering to make' b"your own layout. one piece prices aren't cheap, though," b'as they want for one four position pad *kit*, and b'for a position *kit*.' b'' b'i have no affiliation with dimolex or any company connected' b'with them. i *have* purchased a couple of keypads from them,' b'and am pleased with what i got.' b'' b'cheers,' b'alan' b''
