b'' b'' b' another pair of suggestions:' b' remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay "safe"' b' no matter what the pitcher does.' b'' b'quite honestly, this one is ridiculous. consider the following' b'scenario: runner on third. as the pitcher starts to throw home, the' b'runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for' b'the suicide squeeze. the pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home,' b'but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down. it is the' b'balk rule that prevents this from happening.' b'' b'believe it or not, this actually happened to me once in an oba' b'(ontario baseball association) game in milton, ontario. i was the' b'batter and to my amazement, the umpire missed it. in the years' b'that i played ball, this was worst piece of umpiring i ever saw.' b'--' b'pablo iglesias' b''
