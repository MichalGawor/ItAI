b'' b'okay, the earth has a magnetic field (unless someone missed something?)' b'' b'okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty..' b'' b'no, if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field, it produces a voltage.' b'the two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or' b"move the conductor. the slow shifting of the earth's magnetic field isn't" b"really significant, especially when you consider how weak the earth's magnetic" b'field is to begin with.' b'' b'now the question. can you use electricity to power a space/low earth orbit' b'vehicle? and i fyou can, can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power' b'it??' b'' b'well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel' b"the earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet). of course," b'this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has' b'to be unimaginably powerful. magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the' b"earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak. it would require" b'some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.' b'and seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps). and the' b'physiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our' b'blood, among other things). in other words, forget it.' b'' b'can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the electrical' b'field?' b'' b'after all the dragless satellite is (i might be wrong), a suspended between to' b'pilons, the the pilons compensate for drag.. i think i know what i want to say,' b'just not sure how to say it..' b'' b'a dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator.' b'' b'i missed out on the "dragless satellite" thread, but it sounds totally bogus,' b'from this little bit.' b'--' b'*\t\t\t\t\t* _____/_o_\\_____' b'*\ttwinkle, twinkle, little .sig,\t*(==(/_______\\)==)' b'*\tkeep it less than lines big.\t*
