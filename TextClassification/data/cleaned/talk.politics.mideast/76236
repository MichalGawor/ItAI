b'' b'i have read -just today- two articles dripping of hate and offence to' b'a great deal of people. i could find as much matching hatred in your' b'articles as i have found in some of the self-righteous "kill-in-the-name' b'of god" people.' b'' b"i don't know why you are so attcaking to everyone, is it a reaction to" b'the hatred calls on this newsgroup, or is it a reaction to hardships' b'you have seen and experienced from before...' b'i have learnt not to judge people by only what they say, but rather' b'try to put myself in their place and aspire to understand their' b'feelings.' b'' b'i hope you would be able to do the same with everyone, starting by your' b'ownself, because only through that you could be able to understand your' b'feelings and act in a the manner you would aspire everyone to adopt.' b'' b'thanks for your time' b'' b'nabil' b''
