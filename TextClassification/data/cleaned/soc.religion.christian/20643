b'' b'' b' and the same goes for other cultural practices. the festival' b' of easter may possibly have some historical association with' b' some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as i know,' b' no christians who *intend* to honor any kind of "pagan' b' goddess" by celebrating easter.' b'' b'that argument would be more compelling if it were not for the' b'ishtar eggs and ishtar bunnies. why mix pagan fertility symbols from the' b'worship of the pagan goddess of fertility with biblical belief? what' b'would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word "easter" and' b'replace all such occurances with "resurrection sunday"? would you not' b'show up for services if they were called "resurrection sunday services"' b'rather than "easter services"?'
