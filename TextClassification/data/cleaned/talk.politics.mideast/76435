b'' b'' b' \tall humans suffered emotionally, some jews and many' b' others suffered physically.' b'' b'' b'\tdo you have a problem with the language? i said' b'everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the' b"victims of holocaust. i wasn't implying that anyone suffered" b'more than the actual victims.' b'' b"quite a few people couldn't have cared less about what" b'happened to the jews of europe. if they had cared, they would have' b'done something.' b'' b'what is wrong with you guys? regardless of what one' b'says you keep hearing what you want to hear.' b'' b'maybe its because many of us, who have been on usenet for' b'several years remember tripe like this being posted:' b'' b'-------------' b'' b'|for all those interested, i would like to inform all that binyamin netanyahu' b'|(leader of the israeli likud party) will be interviewed on cnn tonight on' b'|larry king live.' b'|' b'|didn\'t this guy go crying on the "zionist" tv confessing' b'|that he committed adultary, and was cheating on his wife..' b'|' b'|a typical jew leader, huh?' b'' b'this was posted fairly recently. there has been much more' b'racist stuff in the past. why are we expected to listen to it and' b'remain "calm?" i don\'t think that listening to racist or anti-semetic' b'slurs is an incitement to calm debate.' b'' b"perhaps you don't mean to be coming off as highly offensive." b'however, the way you have posted seems to be typical of those who have' b'an irrational dislike for israel and jews. perhaps if you took a' b"close look at what you've posted thought a bit about the combatative" b"tone you've used, you would see why people are reacting the way they" b'are.' b'' b'' b'"if we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we sure' b'wouldn\'t waste them on members of congress..." -john perry barlow'
