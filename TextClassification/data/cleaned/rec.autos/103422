b'' b'anyone else experiencing a similar problem?' b'' b'this concerns the clutch on a honda accord speed. when the clutch' b'is first used in the morning, about the first miles of shifting, there' b'is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up. then the' b'clutch shifts smoothly. this chatter started when i moved to the san' b'francisco bay area from a low-humidity environment. the dealer stated' b'that this is known to happen since honda changed from an asbestos to' b'non-asbestos clutch material. no remedy!! seems that moisture on clutch' b'surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates.' b'' b'any comments out there?'
