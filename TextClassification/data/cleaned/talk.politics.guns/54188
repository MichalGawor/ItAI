b'' b'' b'i have heard many opinions on this subject and would like to hear more from' b'the people on the net.' b'' b"say you're in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody. you" b'give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in their' b'action anyway and you end up shooting and killing them. my question is' b'what do you do? should you stay and wait for the cops or should you' b"collect your brass (if you're using a semi-auto) and get out of there" b"(provided of course you don't think that you have been seen)?" b'' b'as a data point from tennessee, a friend of mine and a police' b'officer essentially recommends that if you can, fade away. even if' b"you were perfectly justified you're likely in for a great deal of" b'hassle. (a side note, carrying a gun concealed is a misdemeanor.)' b'' b'what kind' b'of laws are on the books regarding this type of situation? what would' b'be the most likely thing to happen to you if you stayed and waited and' b'it was a first offense? what would happen if you took off but someone' b'saw you and you were caught?' b'' b'it\'s one of those "by state" things, pretty much.' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group' b"your pushed me down the elevator shaft; i'm beginning to think you don't" b'love me anymore."
