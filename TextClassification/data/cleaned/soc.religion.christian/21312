b'' b'from time to time i have made reference to a book called "the two babylons"' b"which is a book written by alexander hislop (mid 1800's) about the babylonian" b'mystery religion and its flight through history. i was unable to put it down' b'the first time i read it, but others have found it dry. it has numberable' b'references and illustrations. if you are interested in purchasing your own' b'they will ship it to you.' b'it is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the' b'mystery religions. i have found it invaluable for that purpose alone. but for' b'those who only want to skim the subject, it comes highly recommended.' b'just a note to my rc brothers and sisters. you may find this to be a' b'diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the' b'origin of rcism. if you are offended by anything that asks hard questions' b'about your denomination (as to whether or not it is "christian") then perhaps' b'you should just passover this offer. to those who are a little more' b'adventurous, go for it and later, please contact me with you reasons pro or con' b'on the scholorship of this book. i really would be interested.' b'' b'adelphoi ev christos,' b'rex'
