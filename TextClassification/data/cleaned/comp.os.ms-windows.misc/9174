b'' b'' b' i am having a problem configuring the mouse in windows to use com3' b' with irq5.' b'' b"i don't believe irq5 is the problem. i tried a mouse on com3, irq4 (the" b'usual place) and it still did not like it. simply, windows seems to only' b'support mice on com1 or com2. the funny part is, though, that' b"microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse" b"sitting on com3. why can't windows use the mouse driver, or at least" b'support com3? b'' b' com2irq=3' b' com3irq=5' b' com4irq=7' b' maxcomport=4' b'' b"i've tried this too. actually, i wanted to be able to use my second" b'modem (com3/irq5) from windows. it still will not talk to that modem. i' b'created two profiles, amstrad (for my amstrad modem on com1/irq4) and' b'maestro (for my maestro on com3/irq5). it will not talk to the maestro' b'at all.' b'' b' that their driver does not support com3 and com4 in windows.' b" their suggestion was that the 'microsoft or ps/2' setting in windows" b' setup would work. it does not.' b'' b'nor here. (windows b'' b' i can not believe that it is not possible. at worst, you would need a special' b" version of 'a' mouse driver that looked at com3 and com4 instead of com1" b' and com2. i know that irq5 and irq7 are normally printer port irqs, but i' b'' b"i've seen nothing like that. i've experimented with logitech's mouse" b'driver too, with no sucess.' b'' b' have no printers attached. a side note is that i would really like to assign' b' com4 to some higher irq, because my soundblaster board uses irq7 (right now,' b" i'm not using com4), but no modem that i know of allows settings other than" b' irqs and b'' b'if you have a soundblaster pro, it should support irq10 as well.' b'finally, a board that supports irqs the only one i have (except my' b'ide controller).' b'' b'hamish' b'' b'' b'titanic software. voice: for information.' b''
