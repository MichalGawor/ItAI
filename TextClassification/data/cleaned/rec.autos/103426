b'' b'hi there,' b"i've recently been toying with the idea of purchasing an old the going" b'rate seems to be about for cars with anywhere from 40-80k mi.' b'my question is this- what should i expect at this price? should i expect to' b'have extensive body work done? what about engine transmission- should i' b'likewise expect to have both virtually replaced? along those lines,' b'does anyone have the names addresses of any mail-order parts' b"suppliers for everything from engine to body parts? i'm completely new" b"to the area of restoring cars, and as i don't actually do any work with" b'cars, most of the work would have to be professionally done- what sould' b'i expect the cost of upgrading a to a rust-free, mechanically' b'sound automobile?' b'thanks in advance,' b'andre' b'..' b'' b'' b'true enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this' b"but i'll dump my impressions. i've wanted to own a for about years" b'now; came close once but i ended up buying a fiero instead (biggest mistake' b'of my life!)' b'' b'anyway, for you should be able to get a nice car but your also set' b'in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit.' b'the most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the' b'engine and passenger compartment. also look for chassis welded together' b'here. oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the banger;' b'a (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.' b'' b'parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you' b'can even locate crude in the jc whitney catalog if you have too.' b'' b'the machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild' b'washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good' b'bug/porsche mechanic would be easy. since it is mid-engine you may spend' b'more on labor for any mechanical work.' b'' b'--' b'jeff miller network systems corporation' b'internetwork group boone avenue north' b''
