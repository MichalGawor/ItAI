b'' b'this might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study, which i have begun' b'reading, but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum, i will' b'conclude here as well. a week ago, i managed to find time to consult' b'a septuagint concordance and a lxx text with apparatus at the library,' b'and i can now usefully conclude my look at the greek words for love as' b'used in the christian background of the septuagintal translation of the' b'jewish scriptures.' b'' b'the principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal' b'noun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning "lover." this cluster occurs just' b'where one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)' b'of israel as faithless spouse to yhwh. the verses in question are hosea' b'2:5,7 jeremiah lamentations and ezekiel' b'16:33, and b'' b'[ hosea seems to have originated this usage, which jeremiah and' b'ezekiel picked up; lamentations is dependent on, though not' b'likely written by, jeremiah. b'' b'the "erotic" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is' b'evident. so too in english, unless you complement it with a phrase like' b'"of the arts" the word "lover" is going to have an overtone of sexual' b'relationship. there is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see' b'that standard greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the' b'hebrew! b'' b'more interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later koine' b'usage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),' b'_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in codex vaticanus (normally, a very' b'valuable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd' b'context samuel where the meaning *must* be "say."' b'' b'in addition to the above (and the uses i have already mentioned in proverbs),' b'esther uses the verb in its most natural application,' b'' b'kai e:rasthe" ho basileus esthe:r and the king loved esther' b'' b'and, rather more interestingly, samuel supplies a modest degree of' b'support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of david and jonathan:' b'' b'kai io:nathan huios saoul e:[i]reito ton dauid sphodra' b"-- and jonathan, saul's son, loved david intensely" b'' b"[ i'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which i" b"don't yet have a reasonable ascii convention for. b'' b'(the relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about' b'the "historical" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of' b'the hebrew text in the hellenistic period makes no bones about using the' b'"erotic" verb in this context. given the quite general usage of _agapao:_' b'for erotic senses, this need not mean anything "more" than _agapao:_ alone' b'would mean, but it does disambiguate the relationship, as far as this' b'translator goes!)' b'--' b'michael l. siemon\t\ti say "you are gods, sons of the' b'- or -\t\t\tyou shall die like men, and fall'
