b'' b'i read an article about a poll done of students at the ivy league' b'schools in which it was reported that a third of the students' b'indentified themselves as atheists. this is a lot higher than among the' b'general population. i wonder what the reasons for this discrepancy are?' b'is it because they are more intelligent? younger? is this the wave of' b'the future?' b'' b'this is patently absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher' b'must learn not to be frightened by absurdities. bertrand russell'
