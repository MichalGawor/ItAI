b'' b'i have bad luck and got a vd called <granuloma ingunale, which involves' b'the growth of granules in the groin. i found out about it by checking medicine' b'books and i found the prescriptions. and i know i can just go to a clinic to' b'get it cured. but unfortunately i am serving my duty in the army right now and' b"i think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if i take leaves" b'every day for two weeks for treatment. thus i bought the prescribed tablets' b'at some drugstore, but to cure it i must get injection of <streptomycin, with' b'a dose of 1g every hours, for at least days. i can probably buy the' b"tools and this solution somewhere but i don't know how to do injection by myself" b'!' b'can any kind people here tell me:' b'' b"if it's possible to do it? can i do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hip" b'only?? any info is welcome and please write me or post your help soon!! (i am' b"already taking the tablets ..and i can't wait!!)" b'' b"please don't flame me for posting this, and don't judge me. i've learned a" b'lesson and all i need now is real medical help.' b'' b'desperate from taipei'
