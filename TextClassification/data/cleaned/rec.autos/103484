b'' b'' b"i am in the process of buying a new auto. i haven't decided yet whether" b'i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new' b'auto purchase.' b'' b'i know that the "blue book" value for the car is an acquaintence' b'has offered to give me blue book value for the car. i am just wondering' b'if this is a standard measure for negotiating a resale price or if i' b'can hope to get more money from someone else. what exactly is blue book' b'value based on? i know that for its year my car has low mileage' b'(< it is in excellent working condition but does have a few' b'dings on the exterior (nothing major). do any of these facts alter the' b'fair selling p[rice of the car? i am not looking to rip anyone off, i' b'just naturally want to get the best price for the car.' b'' b'thanks a million,' b'veek' b'' b'i think the blue book is the nada handbook for used car prices, no?' b'is the blue book value given the retail or wholesale value??? the' b"blue book value isn't set in stone, though. low milage, extra addons" b'and stuff like that there can increase the resale price of the car, you' b'may want to head on over to the local library or borrow your friends' b'blue book and read up on that sort of stuff. i paid under bb' b"(retail) for my civic in and it was in perfect condition and" b'had only ~14.5k miles on it. the guy was desparate to sell, new kid on' b'the way, etc., but it was a good price. remeber, both you and the' b'buyer, if he has any sort of brains at all, are using the blue book, so' b'you should pick a fair price.' b'' b'' b'chintan amin' b'' b'--' b'*******sig under construction hard hat area********'
