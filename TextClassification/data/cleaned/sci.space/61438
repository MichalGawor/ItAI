b'' b"i expect that retrieving hst would involve 'damaging' it considerably in" b'order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay. most of the deployed' b'items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not' b'retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand...' b'' b'no, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch. indeed, this' b'dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be' b'retractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed' b'to the array-flapping problems.' b'' b'the retrieval problems are exactly as stated: it would be costly, would' b'involve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not' b'to re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot' b'of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination.' b'--'
