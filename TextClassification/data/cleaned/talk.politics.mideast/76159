(i'm not a conspiracy theorist" b'myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).' b'' b'' b'as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace, maybe.' b'however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish' b'state, where jews are in control and jews are the masters of' b'the land. living in peace is meaningless unless it means' b'living *with* someone else, as equal. for a native arab, this' b'does not leave many options.' b'' b'\toh, you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens? the' b'arabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who' b'they vote for as the jews.' b'' b"again adam, the devil is in the details. i don't want to get" b'on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its' b'ok to return deportes and leave the rest. because is' b'a nice number that you can devide by and besides, it' b'has an integer square root.' b'' b'those palestinians who stayed, actually stayed despite of what' b'happened, and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless' b'and ineffective minority.' b"if i were wrong, you'd have israel recall all the" b"palestinian refugees (we're talking millions). after all," b'they are civilians.' b'' b'\thuh? the people who left, did so voluntarily. there is no' b'reason for israel to let them in.' b'' b'do you actually believe this? my experience tells me that' b'every palestinian i knew still keeps the key to his home, in' b'palestine. besides they often refer to their exodus as an' b'escape from hell (so to speak). i know none that agrees with' b"you. did you sample their opinions? i know you don't care," b'just being rethorical.' b'' b'' b'israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it' b'had to maintain a democratic facade (to keep the western aid' b'flowing).' b'' b'\tisrael got no western aid in nor in or 50...it' b'still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained. and how' b'is granting citizenship a facade?' b'' b"don't get me wrong. i beleive that israel is democratic" b'within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (jews).' b'israel probably had a few options after ethnic' b'cleansing serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the' b'international community, or make the best out of a no win' b'condition: show the world how good israel is towards the' b"'bad' arabs. personaly, i've never heard anything about the" b"arab community in isreal. except that they're there. so" b"yes, they're there. but as a community with history and" b'roots, its dead.' b'' b'\ttell me something, sam. what makes land "arab?"' b'' b'how shall i explain, its a contract between the man and the' b"land. control isn't it. the ottomans ruled years, and" b'then left with barely a trace. the concept of land identity' b'is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west. it is' b"partly the concept of 'le sol natal', native soil. i know" b'that jews had previous history in the region, but none in' b"recent memory. i'm talking everyday life not archeology." b'' b"\ttry again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to" b' establish what it is.' b'' b'\talso, jews did have history in israel for over a thousand' b'years. there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel.' b'there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly b'jews were a majority in jerusalem from or so onwards. does that' b'make the land jewish?' b'' b'' b'i stand corrected. i meant that the jewish culture was not' b'predominant in palestine in recent history. i have no' b'problem with jerusalem having a jewish character if it were' b'predominantly jewish. so there. what to make of the rest' b'palestine?' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'sam zbib bell-northern research' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'fax: b'surface mail: stop p.o.box station c, ottawa, canada, k1y 4h7' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b"my opinions are my own and no one else's"
