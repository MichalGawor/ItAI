b'' b' hi all,' b'' b' has anybody tried to compile ctrltest from the mfc/samples directory,' b' after compiling the mfc-libs with bwc b'' b" seems to me, that bwc isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded" b' functions.' b' for example, imagine the following (overloaded) functions:' b' void same_name void b' void same_name int b'' b' after trying the whole day, i think, with bwc its impossible to take the' b' adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined' b' function pointer.' b' am i right has anybody else had this problem b'' b' \tthanx' b'' b"i think you may be chasing the wrong problem. i don't think it is the" b'function overloading at all-- i do that sort of thing all of the time' b'in bc++ without a hitch. the big problems i have encountered in' b'porting mfc to bc++ is that fact that mfc _depends_ on a couple of' b'invalid c++ assumptions.' b'' b'i have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under bc++, but' b'the reason is that ms makes some bad assumptions about the order in' b'which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are' b'getting accessed before they are initialized). the problem is in the' b'owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all' b'other pieces of ctrltest work fine.' b'' b'two other major gotchas i have found using mfc under bc++:' b'' b'- the cfile::openflags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,' b'rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ' b'between msc and bc).' b'' b'- all of the mfc collection classes depend on another bad c++' b'assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place' b'of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, not for' b'references).' b'' b'i am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but i have' b'not encountered them (yet). i have not seen mfc yet, but i hope' b"that some of these will be addressed. if they are not, all of ms's" b"hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that." b'' b'--' b"if these were my employer's opinions, i wouldn't be posting them." b'###############################################################################' b'"whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously r. brendler' b'not a cubs fan..." mike royko spss, inc. chicago il'
