b'' b'' b'if i hear someone screwing with my car (ie, setting off the alarm) and' b'taunting me to come out, you can be damn sure that my colt delta elite' b"will also be coming with me. it's not the screwing with the car that'd" b"get them shot, it's the potential physical danger. if they're" b"taunting like that, it's very possible that they also intend to rob" b'me and/or do other physically harmful things.' b'' b'here in houston last year a woman heard the sound of someone in her' b'garage, so she went to investigate with a gun in her hand. she' b'found a guy in the process of stealing her bicycle. she quite' b'reasonably asked him to stop. he refused, began taunting her, and' b'as the woman was quoted in the police report, "he told me to go' b'ahead and shoot him, so i did." the moron survived, and no' b'charges were filed against the woman.'
