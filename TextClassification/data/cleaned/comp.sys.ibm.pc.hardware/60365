b'' b'' b"i'm trying to transfer some software between two machines" b"and i'm having real trouble. my own intel 14.4k b'v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--i just talk to it' b'at 56k and everything comes out clear. this other modem,' b'at the other machine, is a "turbomodem+" from "the' b'complete pc" (the machines are in seperate houses,' b'so a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this' b'much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines' b'on for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not' b'pirated software).' b'' b'i am having no end of trouble trying to set it up. it will' b'dial and connect just fine--at baud. but if i try to' b'set the comm at 19k2, 38.4k or 56kbps, the stupid thing' b'connects, but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k).' b"his machine (a dx48633) has a 16550afn uart, so that's" b'not the problem.' b'' b'it seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to' b'a comm program _at_ 14.400bps, even though it will take' b'dialing instructions at 56k (and respond ok, etc. to' b"other commands). i don't have a comm program that can" b'do precisely 14.4k.' b'' b'i looked at the manual but it was unclear. all i know is,' b"i didn't have this trouble with the intel--it came" b'ready to connect this way. do i need to initialize it' b'any way in particular?' b'' b"also, it's _using_ v.42bis and v.42 (and mnp5) when connecting" b'here (i.e., at since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far)' b"but it doesn't _say_ so there. any ideas?" b'' b'(btw: i tried the initialization string that i use for' b'my modem, but it just gives error on that one)' b'' b'' b'--' b'moscow: a grandfather who taught literature in an orphanage has gone on trial' b'in rostov-on-the-don after confessing to more than gruesome sexual murders' b'whose victims included children as young as eight.' b'-- events in modern history, from the sunday mail, 19-apr-92'
