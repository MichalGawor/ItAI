b'' b'' b' all jews suffered during wwii, not just our beloved who perished or were' b' tortured. we all suffered.' b'' b' \tall humans suffered emotionally, some jews and many' b' others suffered physically.' b'' b" i'm just waiting for andi to tell us that african americans should" b' start paying compensation to white americans who "suffered" from being' b' slave owners.' b'' b'do you have a problem with the language? i said' b'everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the' b"victims of holocaust. i wasn't implying that anyone suffered" b'more than the actual victims. neither was i implying any' b'wrongdoing on the part of the jews as the cause for the' b'holocaust. what is wrong with you guys? regardless of what one' b'says you keep hearing what you want to hear.'
