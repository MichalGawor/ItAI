b'' b'' b'i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for' b'the border of a window or for the "user" window. maybe other window managers' b'have similar options.' b'another way to figure out the difference between the "user" window position' b'and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their' b'positions. you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager' b'decorations window is the parent of your window. unfortunately, you can only' b'figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped' b'this way.' b'' b'\tanother way would be to use getgeometry to find out where' b'you are relative to the frame, and translatecoordinates to find' b"out where your window's upperleft corner really is." b'' b'' b"as i've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of" b'the window manager decoration. if your window has been reparented, you' b"can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that" b'holds all of the window manager decoration. there may be several' b"layers of windows. doing multiple xquerytree's until you get to the" b"root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside" b'decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).' b'' b'--' b''
