b'' b'' b" here's a question that some friends and i were debating last night." b'' b' q: if you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that' b' unbelievers simply remained dead, would you remain a christian?' b'' b' my contention is that if you answer this question with "no. i would' b' not then remain a christian" then you really are not one now.' b' following jesus christ has everything to do with sharing in' b' his work and spreading the news that the kingdom of heaven is already' b' among us. fear-based religion is not a faith-relationship with the' b' one who made us all.' b'' b"so does that mean that anyone who is a christian to avoid hell isn't really" b'a christian at all? it sounds like it to me.' b'' b'mit liebe in christus,' b'' b'' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'the university of liverpool, b'p.o. box b'liverpool, b'england, b"l69 9bx. `dubito ergo deus est.'" b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
