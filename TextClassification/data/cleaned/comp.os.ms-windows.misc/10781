b'' b'' b'' b'currently, we are using winfax software to receive/send fax on our' b'pcs. it works pretty well. the problem is that all received files are' b'in bit map format, which take lots of hd space. i have been told there' b'is some programs that can do pattern recognition of the raster' b' b'characters in fax-in files and translate them into ascii code, then' b'store the file in ascii format.' b'' b'would you like to tell me' b'\t(1) whether or not there is such software package to do such' b' \t translation?' b'\t(2) if there is one, where can i find it?' b'\t(3) is any such software package on public domain?' b'' b'what version of winfax do you have? the newest version has an ocr' b'(optical character recognition) built in... what this means is that it can' b'take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ascii so that one can edit' b'the document w/o re-typing it... however, i found that the ocr that comes' b'packaged with winfax does not work as well as omnipage professional (also' b'by delrina software)... so, once again, winfax ver. has what you are' b'looking for... good luck!' b'' b'regards,' b'' b'zizi'
