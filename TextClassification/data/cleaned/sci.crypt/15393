b'' b'' b'' b'[..stuff deleted]' b'existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of' b'possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)' b'a des keysearch machine.' b'' b' as originally described, it sounded like any police court combination' b"could acquire the key for a given chip. i hope that's not the case, since" b'it would imply a glaring hole. (how much does it cost to find *one* crooked' b'jodge and *one* crooked cop? especially for a foreign intelligence agency' b'or organized crime boss?) however, even if more intelligent schemes are used' b'to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-' b'nesses. they may be very expensive, and very difficult. but who would' b'trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for' b'(say) could by cracked one time in a hundred? (des, for all the' b'complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars' b'to build a keysearch machine for.)' b'' b'' b'i can buy a des keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500k, but' b'it is not sold by that name. go buy a circuit emulation machine (eg. quickturn)' b"containing a bunch of fpgas, (say to 3090's), and program each" b'to be a des search engine. lets say chips, running at 10mhz 5g tests/sec.' b"time is 14e6 sec max weeks, weeks average. can't wait that long?" b'buy a bigger machine.' b'' b'' b'david lewis'
