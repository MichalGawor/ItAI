b'' b'i remember someone mention about a 150meg syquest. has anyone else' b"heard anything about this? i'd be interested in the cost per megabyte and the" b'approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the bernoulli b'' b'i think you must be talking about the syquest (code named mesa i believe).' b'it is a winchester technology drive pretty much like the other syquest' b'drives in terms of how it works. according to the latest macleak, the' b'drive has a ms access time, mb/s sustained throughput (these figures' b'are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of' b'performance nonetheless). the drive was originally released for the pc' b"and just recently was released for the mac world (don't ask me what the" b'differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according' b'to a syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.' b'i have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in macleak' b"including pli, massmicro, clubmac, and macwarehouse's poweruser. the pli" b'and massmicro units are priced at just around the lesser name brands' b'are going for around for an external drive. cartridges which hold' b'105 mb sell for about each. at these prices, the drives and cartridges' b'are cheaper and better performing than the 88mb drives.' b'cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and bernoulli' b'drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more' b"reliable. personally, i'm excited by the new drive and look forward to" b'getting my hands on one.' b'-chris wand' b'' b'--' b'' b'"egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."' b'- frank leahy'
