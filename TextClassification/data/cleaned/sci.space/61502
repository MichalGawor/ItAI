b'' b'' b'first you need to do the literature search. there is a lot of information' b'out there. maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.' b'this could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net. then' b'we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.' b'' b'such a detailed literature search would be of interest to' b'ourselves as space advocates' b'and clearly important to existing space programs.' b'in essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into' b'various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.' b'this database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the' b'basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet,' b'and any other source!' b'' b'unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,' b'i think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search' b'first. then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis. the data' b'base itself could be useful for future engineers.' b'' b"that's my response ken, what do you think?" b'' b'tim' b'' b'well, i agree. i hope others chime in with suggestions on specific' b'technologies which could be applied towards the maintenance of an' b'earth like atmosphere on a long-duration spacecraft.' b'' b'tim et al:' b'i think we should try looking at atmosphere first.' b'this seems to be the single most fundamental issue in keeping anyone alive.' b"we're all taught that when supporting a patient" b'you look for maintaining airway. so, in keeping with my trauma training' b'(and keeping my emergency medicine professor happy), i suggest that' b'we look at the issues surrounding a regenerable atmospheric circuit.' b'' b'howz that tim?' b'' b'ken'
