b'' b'' b'well, i just got my centris yesterday. it took just over two' b'weeks from placing the order. the dealer (rutgers computer store)' b'appologized because apple made a substitution on my order. i ordered' b'the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.' b'he wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!! they must' b"be backlogged on centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them" b'with!' b'' b"anyway, i'm very happy with the with a few exceptions." b'being nosy, i decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first' b'time. the scsi cable to the hard drive was only partially connected' b'(must have come loose in shipping). no big deal, but i would have been' b"pissed if i tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!" b"the hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine. i've" b'heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so i might try to get' b'it swapped.' b'i am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off. this' b"wasn't mentioned in any of the literature i saw. also, the location" b'of the reset/interupt buttons is awful. having keyboard control for' b'these functions was much more convenient.' b'oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.' b"i've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature..." b"anyway, above all, it's fast. a great machine at a great price!" b''
