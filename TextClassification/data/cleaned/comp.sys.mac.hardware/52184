b'' b"here's the scoop:" b'' b'for the past two years, i have been using an se/30 with a sony 1304s and' b'a lapis video card. this past month, i bought a quadra and am now' b'using the sony on it. my se/30 has been shipped home to my father who' b'is planning on getting an apple monitor (the trinitron one). my' b'question is this: what kind of power cord will he get with the apple' b'monitor. does it come with two types? as i recall, one can hook up the' b'power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my' b"quadra however, for my father's se/30, there is no extra plug which" b"allows use of the se/30's power supply. he needs to plug it into the" b'socket separately. so...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow' b'him to do this? will have to buy a different cable? if yes, where can he' b'purchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'derek' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'******************************************************************************' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'bldg 54-1511a clark laboratory b'massachusetts institute of technology woods hole oceanographic institution' b'cambridge, ma woods hole, ma b'(617) x2814' b'*******************************************************************************'
