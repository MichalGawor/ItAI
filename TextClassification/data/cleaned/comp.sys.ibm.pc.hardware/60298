b'' b'i was just reading in pc magazine that the peripherals in a pc with an' b'isa bus can only access 16mb of memory. also, that some video cards on' b'the isa bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to. so that' b"if i wanted to put 16mb of memory on my pc, my video card wouldn't have" b"anywhere to map it's memory to." b'' b'can someone explain this in more detail. is there a way around this' b'limit.' b'' b'if you email me a response, i will summarize.' b'--'
