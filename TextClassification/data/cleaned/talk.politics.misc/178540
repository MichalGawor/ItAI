b'' b':' b': as noted in another thread (limiting govt), the problem libertarians face' b': is insuring that the "limited government" they seek does not become the' b': tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda.' b':' b'' b'[...]' b'' b'it is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any' b'reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.' b'' b'you seem to be saying that a limited government will provide more' b'opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own' b'agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will not happen.' b"while i can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that" b'if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become' b'a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area.' b"i rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have now that is" b'more likely to become such a tool, and that it is such a tool in many' b'instances.' b'' b'just' b'as marxism "fails" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and' b'the state is to "wither away," libertarians frequently fail to show how' b'weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human' b'condition.' b'' b'i suspect that this is because "improvement in the human condition" as' b'you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not' b'be the primary goal of a libertarian government. my impression of' b'libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of' b'government coercion except in a very limited cases.' b'--' b'ian sutherland' b'' b'sans peur'
