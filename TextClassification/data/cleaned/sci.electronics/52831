b'' b"here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:" b'' b"i bought an 'infrared detector module' at radio shack for it is a" b'little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. then' b'i hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared led. the circuit works' b'like a minature remote control extender in my car all remote commands are' b'relayed to the cd player hidden in the glove compartment. it works fine with' b"my denon cd player, but when i tried to build the same circuit for a friend's" b"vcr, it didn't work." b'the circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a' b'sony ccd camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my cd' b'player...' b'' b'any advice would be appreciated....' b'brian' b'' b'---' b''
