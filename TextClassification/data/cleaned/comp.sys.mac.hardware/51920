b'' b'after reading reports from germany of success in accelerating a quadra' b'or centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, i decided to test the' b"claim. i pulled out my variable speed overdrive and the motherboard's" b"50 mhz clock chip. i put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a" b"64 mhz ttl clock oscillator i had left over from working on some si's." b"i can't believe it. it actually works. i'm not getting scsi timing errors" b"either. this is only after a short run time but i'll keep posting results." b'did i spend all that money on the vso for nothing? if this keeps working,' b'the lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort.' b''
