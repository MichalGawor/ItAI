b'' b"i've installed many x apps, and have that many of them imakefiles that have" b'lines startingwith xcomm in them. when i do a xmkmf to create the makefile,' b'the makefile also has the xcomm (comment?) lines in them. i always have' b'to edit out these lines because the make command barfs on them. i was' b'wondering what these lines were for, and what i might be doing wrong that' b'causes the make command to dislike them. thanks!'
