b'' b'' b"i've got two lines coming into my apartment. two different telephone numbers." b'when i ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another b'wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. so i' b'have one line on red green and the other on yellow black.' b'' b'today i was monitoring the voltage on both lines. i had a voltmeter across' b'the red and green and read back volts. i then lifted up the receiver on my' b'second line.(black yellow wires) the voltage dropped to volts on the first' b'line. (red green wires) i repeated this experiment with the second' b'line(monitoring black yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the' b'red and green line.) it also dropped to volts.' b'' b'why is this i thought these were separate lines.' b'' b'next i went to the block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in' b'from the telco cable. i then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and' b'went back to the block and did some resistance measurements. both lines read' b'open.' b'' b"i'll appreciate any help on this. is this considered normal b'' b'guy urbina' b'' b''
