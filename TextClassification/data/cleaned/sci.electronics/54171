b'' b'inkjet and bubblejet printers are the same tech. "bubblejet" was trademarked' b'by cannon and inkjet was by hp i belive. i have seen both, and own a' b'"bubblejet" (a apple stylewriter which has a cannon engine) with a dpi' b'rated output. the output is very good with quality paper, which is' b'very importaint. cheap paper gives bad results. i use sealed paper and' b'the only differenc is that the ink is less dark than toner (i compaire' b'to the apple personal laserwriter ntx), but then again the difference' b'is to so....' b'' b'--' b'/------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'| david a. smith "i like to skate on the other side of the ice"'
