b'' b'' b'i am looking for some information of hidden line removal using roberts' b'algorithm. something with code, or pseudo code would be especially' b'helpful.' b'' b'i am required to do this for a class, due monday (we have very little' b'time to implement these changes, it is a very fast paced class). the' b'notes given in class leave a lot to be desired, so i would vastly' b'appreciate any help.' b'' b'actually any algorithm would be nice (roberts or no). the main problem' b'is two objects intersecting in x and y dimensions, need to know which' b'lines to clip off so that one object will appear in front of another.' b'' b'if you can give me an ftp address and filename, or even the name of a' b"good book, i'd really appreciate it." b'' b"g'day brian," b'' b"i'll be blunt about this. the only reasonable explanation of roberts" b'algorithm is in' b'' b'procedural elements for computer graphics' b'rogers' b'mcgraw-hill book co. b'' b'go to the library and look at this.' b'' b'there is also a somewhat muddled explanation in the first edition' b'of newman and sproull.' b'' b'the algorithm described in pecg runs in near linear time.' b'' b'luck,' b'' b'dave rogers'
