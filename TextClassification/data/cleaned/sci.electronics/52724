b'' b'for an upcoming project i want to use megs of dram configured as two b'meg banks of bit data. i was wondering if anyone out there knows of a' b"dram controller which will handle refreshing the data. it's ok if the" b"controller doesn't handle bank switching that part is easy." b'' b'the only controllers i know of are the ones out of the national' b'semiconductor dram management handbook edition) eg. dp8429. i would' b'like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to' b'implement in my circuit.' b'' b'btw, if anyone is wanting to hook up dram to a microcontroller, dallas' b'semiconductor makes a neat chip: the ds1262 serial dram nonvolatizer' b'chip. it uses the spi (i2c) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16mx1 of dram' b'memory. it can use an external battery to refresh the dram when the' b'power is off. price is from dallas (quan i wish i could use' b'this chip but its maximum spi clock rate is mhz (too slow for me...).' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'' b'wayne schellekens' b'--' b'whiteshell laboratories twisted pair: x2317'
