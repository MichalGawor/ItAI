b'' b'' b' b' first of all i never said the holocaust. i said before the' b" holocaust. i'm not ignorant of the holocaust and know more" b' about nazi germany than most people (maybe including you).' b' b" uh oh! the first sign of an argument without merit--the stating of one's" b' "qualifications" in an area. if you know something about nazi germany,' b" show it. if you don't, shut up. simple as that." b' b" \ti don't think the suffering of some jews during wwii" b' justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government. any' b' attempt to call civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is' b' not appreciated.' b' b' all jews suffered during wwii, not just our beloved who perished or were' b' tortured. we all suffered. second, the name-calling was directed against' b' you, not civil-libertarians in general. your name-dropping of a fancy' b' sounding political term is yet another attempt to "cite qualifications"' b' in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument. go' b' back to the minors, junior.' b' \tall humans suffered emotionally, some jews and many' b' others suffered physically. it is sad that people like you are' b" so blinded by emotions that they can't see the facts. thanks" b' for calling me names, it only assures me of what kind of' b' ignorant people i am dealing with. i included your letter since' b' i thought it demonstrated my point more than anything i could' b' write.' b'' b'-----' b"when you're willing to actually support something you say with fact or" b'argument rather than covering up your own inadequacies with feigned' b'offense, let me know. otherwise, back to your own league, son.'
