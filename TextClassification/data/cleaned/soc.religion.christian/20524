b'' b'' b' in quebec french, the word for the celebration of the resurrection is' b' "pa^ques"--this is etymologically related to pesach (passover) and the' b' pascal lamb. so is the french canadian (mostly roman catholic) celebration' b' better because it uses the right name?' b'' b"i was at my parents' seder and noticed the labelling on one of the" b'packages was english, hebrew and french. in the phrase "kosher for' b'passover" the french word used was "pa^ques." we\'ve deliberately' b'mistranslated this at the kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods' b'being kosher for easter. b'' b'however, the word "pa^ques" in french _is_ the word for easter. ask' b"any francophone, whether from quebec or from paris. besides, haven't" b'you heard of the phrase "the paschal lamb" (meaning jesus)?' b'' b'sorry to nitpick on the more trivial part of this thread....' b'' b':) vera' b'*******************************************************************************' b'i am your clock! i bind unto myself today vera noyes' b'i own you!\t trinity....\t\t no disclaimer what' b"- lard\t |\t- st. patrick's breastplate is there to disclaim?"
