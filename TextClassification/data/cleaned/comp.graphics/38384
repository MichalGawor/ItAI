b'' b'|' b'| a stupid question, but what will cview run on and where can i get it? i' b'| am still in need of a gif viewer for linux. (without x-windows.)' b'| thanks!' b'| b'|' b'| ho boy. there is no way in hell you are going to be able to view gifs or do' b'| any other graphics in linux without x windows! i love linux because it is' b'| so easy to learn.. you want text? okay. use linux. you want text and' b'| graphics? use linux with x windows. simple. painless. required to have' b'| x windows if you want graphics! this includes fancy word processors like' b'| doc, image viewers like xv, etc.' b'|' b'' b'sorry, bryan, this is not quite correct. remember the vgalib package that comes' b'with linux/sls? it will switch to vga 320x200x256 mode *without* xwindows.' b"so at least it is *possible* to write a gif viewer under linux. however i don't" b'think that there exists a similar svga package, and viewing gifs in 320x200 is' b'not very nice.' b'' b'best regards,' b'' b'arno' b'' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'arno schaefer\t\t\t\tensimag, 2e annee' b'tel.: 95\t\t\t:-)' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
