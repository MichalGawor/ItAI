b'' b'here are some recent observations taken by the hubble space telescope:' b'' b'o the faint object spectrograph (fos) was used to make ultraviolet' b'observations of both the planet pluto, and its moon charon. the' b'peakups were successful. the observations were executed as' b'scheduled, and no problems were reported.' b'' b'o observations were made using the high speed photometer of the planet' b'uranus during an occultation by a faint star in capricornus. these' b"observations will help in our understanding of the planet's" b'atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. this event occurred' b'close to the last quarter moon, and special arrangements had to be' b'made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.' b'the observations are currently being reviewed, and all the' b'observations looked okay.' b'' b'___ b'| jet propulsion lab b'___| m/s telos being cynical never helps' b'/___| pasadena, ca to correct the situation' b'|_____|/ and causes more aggravation' b'| instead.'
