b'' b"hello-- i'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is" b'intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as' b'x. a friend and i are designing the chip as the final course project for' b'an advanced computer architecture course taught by dr. fred brooks at' b"unc-chapel hill. while we feel that we've got a pretty solid design" b"currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an" b'x-windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit' b'budget.' b'' b"unfortunately, i've been unable to find anything of this sort in the" b"various x faqs, or x manuals that i've seen. does anyone have some type of" b'frequency data, like how many copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and' b'things of that sort? or, barring that, a program that records requests to' b'the server into a logfile that i can munge on myself?' b'' b'any and all help would be very appreciated.' b'' b'many thanks,' b'---mark' b'' b'==============================================================================='
