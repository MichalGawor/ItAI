b'' b'picture our universe floating like a log' b'in a river. as the log floats down the' b'river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the' b'bank, the bottom, other logs. when this collission' b'occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the' b'log degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy' b'translaions occur. the distribution of damage to' b'the log depends on the shape of the log.' b'' b'however, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a' b'termite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the' b'collissions would appear uniformly random in direction.' b'' b'this is my theory for grb. they are evidence of our universe' b'interacting with other universes! why not! makes' b'just as much sense as the grb coming from the oort cloud!' b'' b"the log theory of universes can't be ruled out!" b'' b"of course, i'm a layman in the physics world. you" b'physicists out there, tell me about this b'' b'' b'bob combs' b'astronautical engineer,' b'stanford telecom' b'.' b''
