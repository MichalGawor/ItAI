b'' b'' b'' b' a while ago i saw some translucent pads, about 6"x8" or so that' b'could be plugged into (something) and they would glow. one was red,' b'another green, another blue. interresting. i was wondering if anyone' b'would have a feed on anything of this nature, and of the price.' b' oh, the pads were rubber-like and were floppy like, about 1cm thick or' b'so.' b'' b'the curiosities that you speak of are el (electro-luminescent) pads. they' b"are mostly used as backlights for lcd's, and as you pointed out, comes" b'in several different colors. many of them emit white-ish colors ("true"' b"white, and blue-whiteis-blue are the ones that i've personally encountered" b'the most often.)' b'' b'they vary in their input requirements, however, they tend to operate at' b'about vrms, and at much higher than hz. hz to khz, if i' b'recall correctly.) you can get them to work at vrms, hz (i.e.,' b"line) but they don't glow as brightly, and they will degrade much faster." b"(oh yes, almost forgot, el's have this tendency to wear out over time...)" b'' b'--' b'msc caltech b'pasadena, ca dear ibm: hire bunch of technically incompetent people' b'+1 (like my brother) to test os/2 installation procedures.'
