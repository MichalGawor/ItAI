b'' b'' b' cutsie little macintrash-like icons that are an instant recipe for' b' mousitis imho. system is undoubtedly the worst gui i have used (out of' b' that, riscos, mswombles, and x11) simply because it does not provide enough' b' keyboard shortcuts. windows i must confess i quite like (cover your ears' b' because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the' b' mouse.' b' [stuff delete]' b' the user rather than making things _easier_ and there should always be' b' the option to do it your way if you want to, which is why i like the' b" unix/x combination so much it's so customizable." b'' b" hear! hear! i agree completely. one thing i can't stand about" b' the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use' b' the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is' b' down!). i like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such' b' as cut and past and moving icons around, etc. but for most' b' work, the keyboard and hot keys are times faster than' b' using the mouse. sure it is a plus to be able to do something' b' simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it' b' before your are experienced? a month? two? (speaking of pcs at' b' the moment.)' b" \ti don't think it is too much to ask that window" b' programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also' b' look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and' b' command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in' b' less time if you are experienced.' b' \tall of the above equally applies to windowing systems on' b' unix (especially since unix is at least more powerful than' b' dos).' b'' b'and at least more user unfriendly as well!'
