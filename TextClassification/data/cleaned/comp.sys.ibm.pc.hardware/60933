b'' b"i'm planning to buy a computer and i like tc's ads. can you tell anything" b'about the company and their computers? also, if anyone has a company they' b'would prefer, please let me know.' b'' b'yes, they are nice ads, and even better: great prices. but this is all on' b'the outside. the consumer sees this and orders. little do they know, they' b'will get *poor* service (very poor). when i ordered a 105mb hard drive from' b'tc about months ago, i received it in the mail, installed it, and' b"discovered it didn't work!!! i sent it back to them, and they said they'd" b'send me a refund check. it took many, many, many phone calls and hate-mail,' b'as well as threats of lawsuit to get back my in fact, it took two' b"whole months of calling and threatening! every time i'd call, i would be" b"put on the run-around until i finally wound up on an answering machine. i'd" b"leave my name and phone but i didn't even get called back *once*. i am" b"one pissed off t.c. customer, \tand if you don't want to get ripped off, or" b'if you want decent service, do not --i repeat-- do not buy from this' b'company. the money saved is not worth the ulcers you will get. pass this' b'word around to your friends. \t\tcompanies like this do not deserve' b"to stay in business, so let's not give them out hard earned money." b'' b'discount micro, systems powerhouse, and gateway all have given me' b'excellent service and speed in the past. i highly recommend them to anyone.' b'' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------' b''
