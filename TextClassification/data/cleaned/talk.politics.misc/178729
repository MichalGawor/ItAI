b'' b'' b'+1. there is no such thing as non-toxic tear gas. tear gas is non-breathable' b"+ remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting, followed eventually" b'+ by siezures and death. did the fbi know the physical health of all the people' b"+ they exposed?? any potential heart problems among the b-d's??" b'' b'they certainly knew that there were pregnant women in there plus' b'children. i could not believe when they said that the gassing was' b'an attempt to "save the children" yesterday. i can\'t think of a much' b'worse sort of child abuse that pouring tear gas into a building.' b'' b'' b'+2. have you ever seen a tear gas canister?? tear gas is produced by burning a' b'+ chemical in the can. the fumes produced are tear gas. the canister has a' b'+ warning printed on the side of it. "contact with flamable material can result' b'+ in fire." now, how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building' b'+ they admited was a fire-trap??' b'' b'i have heard two things recently explaining this:' b'' b'1. they pumped the gas into the building from outside via some' b'sort of pipe rather than by canister.' b'' b'2. the sort of tear gas they are using was described as some' b'sort of powdery material that sticks to things. kind of' b'like a powder cloud.' b'' b'and once again, these are government lacky explainations and' b'since government stories always change, none or all of the' b'information might not be true.' b'' b'' b'+this whole thing was a case of over-reaction by the officials at every step.' b'+i hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are held' b'+accountable. but that is highly unlikely when you figure they are going to' b'+be investigating themselves.' b'' b'or better yet, the texas rangers will be investigating which is' b'probably worse than the fbi or atf investigating itself.' b''
