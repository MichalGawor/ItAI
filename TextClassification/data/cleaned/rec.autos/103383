b'' b'why anyone would order an sho with an automatic transmission is' b"beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a" b'regular taurus and leave the sho to real drivers. that is not to' b"say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg" b"disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an" b'sho anyway.' b'' b'actually, disabled persons have been known to drive in scca' b"races. i'd be careful about making sweeping generalizations here." b'' b"i'd prefer a manual transmission, but the early sho had an" b'awful transmission that felt like it came out of a truck or something.' b'it was almost enough to make me want an automatic.' b'' b'-teddy'
