b'' b'' b'following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of' b'my white cells. (the theory as i understand it is that there is some kind' b'of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as' b'it normally would a "foreign" body. where this blocking is deficient, the' b'body evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. the white cells' b'apparently enhance the blocking capability.) following the transfusion, she' b'successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and jake is now an active' b'9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.' b"we're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including" b'the obgyn who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know' b'whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive' b'pregnancies.' b'is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this?' b'thanks...gene (and jane and jake)' b'' b"p.s. i've also posted this in misc.kids."
