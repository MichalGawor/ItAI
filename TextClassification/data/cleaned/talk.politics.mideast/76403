b'' b'' b'now i have a comment concerning israeli terrorism' b"during the 1930's and 1940's. the hirgun, and other branch b'off militant groups, did fight the british do get them out of' b'palestine. yet i fail to see how this israeli form of' b'terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the' b'arabs. these jewish terrorist groups killed innocent british' b'soldiers, but not only thta also killed many jews who were in' b'favor of a compromise with the palestinians.' b'' b'the irgun killed soldiers, which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted' b"fogriend regime from a country. they didn't kill blindly their families or" b'such (not as a policy, i agree that brits which were not soldiers also were' b'killed sometimes) nor they killed arabs just for being arabs.' b'' b'in case i have to remind you the difference, the majority of the attacks of' b'the arab terrorist organizations was on civilians. they even tried to' b'justify their attacks by saying that all jews in the israel served in the army' b'at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.' b'' b'in addition, they' b'massacred an entire palestinian village in contributing' b'to the exodus of the frightened palestinians who feared their' b'very lives.' b'' b"yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes. i wasn't there and don't have" b'reffereces handy but from what i heard your description is a bit carried away,' b'most of the vilagers fled with several dozens, most of them claimed to be' b'fighters being killed.' b'' b'those "massaceres" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not' b'hounders of arab vilages came under israeli rule during the same time period.' b'' b"i mention this not because i'm anti semitic [i'm part" b'jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the' b"israelites pisses me off so. i'm not as critical of the" b'palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the' b"jews. it 's a damn shame that the palestinians had to pay for" b'german and european anti semitism.' b'' b'what do you mean "screwed over by the jews"? they began the war and' b"didn't accept the arrgenment planned by the u.n., what did you expect the" b'jews to do??' b'' b'pissed off at immature,' b'closeminded, self righteous' b'semites' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'' b'arabs are also semites.' b'--' b'--amos shapira (jumper extraordinaire) "it is true that power corrupts,' b'c.s. system group, hebrew university, but absolute power is better!"' b'jerusalem israel
