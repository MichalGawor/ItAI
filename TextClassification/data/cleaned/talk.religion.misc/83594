b'' b'' b'' b': medtronic.com (dale m. skiba) entirely missed my point in my previous' b': posting, in which i wrote:' b'' b': comment:' b'' b': shortly after that post, i realized two things: i was running a fever of' b': over and that i probably should not have gone directly from reading' b': alt.slack to posting on this august newsgroup.' b'' b': it is not ad hominen to point out that mr archer willingly prints blatant' b': lies' b': in defense of bible inerrancy, and thus is worthless as an expert witness.' b'' b': okay, im game, give us a listing of blatant lies from _encyclopedia of' b': biblical difficulties_ or other archer writings.' b'' b': that would be interesting. if only a very short list can be generated,' b': i think it is more likely that mr. archer, with his inerancy mindset is' b': not always impartial and made a doozy of a mistake. (imho i also think' b': that this mindset tends to generate these sorts of mistakes...)' b'' b': on the other hand, if a long list can be generated, it is more likely' b': that mr. archer intentionally uses deception in hs books. (why should' b': he be deceptive just with tyre?)' b'' b': so, archer is just sitting around, rubbing his hands and plotting how next' b': to deceive? ok, lets _see_ the list...' b'' b'this was an open question. i assumed that if mr. archer is a chronic' b'liar, someone whould have documented it. this assumption is based on' b'how talk.origins regulars have documented numerous cases of creationist' b'deceptions (such as duane guish and his friends).' b'' b'no long list of archer mistakes has yet been given, so this may be just' b'an isolated incident...' b'' b'--' b'dale skiba'
