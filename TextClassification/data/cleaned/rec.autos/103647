b'' b'' b'' b'| i just wanted to know:' b'|' b'| to wheelspin in an auto, you keep the gear in n gas it then stick the' b"| gear in d... i've never tried this but am sure it works but does this screw" b"| up the autobox? we're having a bit of a debate about it here..." b'' b'' b'ah yes, the neutral slam.' b'' b"i know that gm tested the old th400's and th350's by shifting from reverse to" b'forward gears repeatedly while holding the engine at high rpms. the units hold' b'up incredibly well. this is also the recommended technique to "rock" a stuck' b'vehicle out of the mud. i think the hydraulics are up to the task, but the' b'mechanicals of the driveline may object by breaking something.' b'' b'$0.02' b'' b'ericy' b'i agree about the durability of the old th400 trannies from gm. while i' b"never intentionally slamed my firebird ci conv. into gear, i would leave" b'the trannie in low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires' b'grabbed, take off. when i reached about 57-60mph the turbo auto would' b"shift to s (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about to foot of double" b'stripped rubber on the ground. most everyone i knew at the time was quite' b"impressed with 'peeling' out at mph. the trannie held up just fine." b'motor mounts would last about a year until i tied the motor down with large' b'chains. oh yea,fyi: pontiac ci bored over' b'large valve heads' b'holley spread bore' b"crain 'blazer' cam (don't remember the specs)" b'positrac, hooker headers, dual exhaust' b'get this (conv., leather seats, power windows' b'power top, ac, cruise etc.)' b'' b"oh yea, i also pulled the 'cocktail shakers' (weights) from the front" b'and removed the lead pellet from the accelerator pedal.
