b'' b'' b'and now, the not so pleasant surprises:' b'' b'\t2)tartabull. the book on tartabull was, keep him healthy and' b"\t he'll produce. well, he hasn't done too much so far. sure. he's" b"\t hit a few homers, but those were all solo shots, and he hasn't" b'\t gotten any of the "big" rbis that your cleanup man is supposed' b'\t to give you. then again, he had a slow start last year (once he' b'\t got off the dl, that is) and turned into a one-man wrecking crew' b'see you in the series!' b'' b'-alan' b'' b'' b"let's see... april 15th... less than at bats.... and you claim that he" b"hasn't done too much so far!" b'' b"cut this guy some slack. danny will produce this year. it's scary to think" b"just how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year." b'' b'the yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good' b'bullpen, good defense and a good lineup. also, i like buck showalter. frank' b'howard on 1st is also a good move. everything sounds good so far.' b'' b'if the yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant. this' b'is the most fun i\'ve had watching the yanks since b'' b'-bobby' b''
