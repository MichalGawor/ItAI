b'' b'' b' why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)' b'when stored on a concrete floor?' b' i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle' b'from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and i just' b'went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but' b'they act like the two terminals are shorted. i asked a friend' b"and he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them," b"but he couldn't tell me why." b'' b'this topic was beaten to death a year or so ago.' b'' b'the concrete is not the problem.' b'' b'lead-acid batteries often fail from disuse (not being charged for a long' b"time), but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the" b'problem.' b'' b'the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a' b"colder lead-acid battery self-discharges at a slightly faster rate. that's" b"why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works" b'to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery' b"thermally. it you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it will" b'self-discharge even slower. the best thing would be to attach a small load' b'such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it' b'on constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to "shallow-' b'cycle" the charge in the battery. such mild "exercising" of a lead-acid' b'battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for' b'storage. if you do remove the electrolyte, may sure you keep separate storage' b"containers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells" b"when you refill the battery. this isn't so critical for a brand-new battery" b'in a fully charged state, but will maximize the restored output of an older' b'battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for' b'storage.' b'--' b'=============================================================================' b"neal howard xlh-1200 dod computrac, inc (richardson, tx)" b"std disclaimer: my opinions are mine, not computrac's." b'"let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps' b'we shall learn the truth." august kekule\' b'============================================================================='
