b'' b'op that worked was the "macintosh\r| software" loop (whatever that means).\r| \r| i doubt this is a quadra-specific problem. i had to get\r| rid of my "venerable" bernoulli last year (with enough \r| cartridges purchased at each to make the whole thing \r| worth more than my whole computer the tech support guys\r| at ocean microsystems suggested that some third-party drivers \r| might fix the problem in my case the cartridges wouldn\'t \r| format/mount/partition for a/ux.' b'hat the megadrives worked perfectly on both my\rmac plus and my powerbook it was for this reason i assumed\rthe problem had something to do with the quadra. even with the\rquadra, they mostly worked ok. the problem occurred when i ejected\ra cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes\rsaying "this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware"\reven though there was no cartridge in the drive.\r\r\t--mark' b'<disclaimer: mac exchange bbs cannot be held responsible for the contents of this message'
