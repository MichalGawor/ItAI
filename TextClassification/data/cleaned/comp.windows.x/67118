b'' b'' b'| i have a sun that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 built on the' b'| motherboard. the same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 b'| daughterboard. i have been using this system with a color monitor having a' b'| color "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the' b'| bwtwo1, both on the same tube. i recentley picked up a x sun mono' b'| monitor, and i would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and' b'| the bwtwo0. i do not care if i loose the "back" screen on the color tube' b'| from the bwtwo1. after looking through the xsun man page i am not sure if' b'| this is possible. has anybody sucessfuly done this before?' b'' b"if it's any consolation, i have two 2-headed sun-3/60 systems, though the" b'color and mono monitors for each are "rated" 1152x900. their configuration' b'is the same as yours, so it "should" be a plug\'n\'play situation, except:' b'' b"i don't know if your hi-res mono monitor will function this way. however," b'you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the hi-res jumper' b'(located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the ram/simm selects' b'and ethernet connection) and be happily on your way. when you pull the' b'motherboard, the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. "north-west") quadrant' b'of the motherboard (to the left of the simm sockets).' b''
