b'' b'hi damon, no matter what system or explanation of creation you wish' b'to accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation' b'from nothing, or creation from something. there are no other' b'alternatives. and if we accept one or the other of those two' b'premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was' b'random, or was according to some plan.' b'if it was random, i am unable to accept that the complex nature of' b'our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures' b'could exist as they do. therefore i am left with creation under the' b'control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme. i call' b'that intelligence god.' b'i also prefer the "creatio ex nihilo" rather than from chaos, as it' b'is cleaner.' b'there is obviously no way to prove either or neither. we are and' b'we must have come from somewhere. choose whatever explanation you' b'feel most comfortable with, damon. you are the one who has to live' b'with your choice.' b'shalom, len howard'
