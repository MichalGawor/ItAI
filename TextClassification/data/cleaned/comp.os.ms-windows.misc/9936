b'' b'' b'i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse.com (was using b'i think, but switched to to see if it was any better). vertical motion' b"is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can't click" b'on something because my mouse jumps around. i can be moving the mouse to' b'the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly' b'for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump' b'again (maybe this time to the left about inch!). this is crazy! i have' b'never had so much trouble with a mouse before. anyone have any solutions?' b'' b'does microsoft think they are what everyone should be? just venting steam!' b'' b'i think i have the same problem. i think it is caused by the rubber ball' b"in the mouse, which doesn't roll so smooth. the detectors in the mouse" b'notice this and whoops, i hit a mine (using minesweeper b'' b'i think the solution will be buying a new mouse, and/or using a mouse pad.' b'' b'wouter.' b'' b'' b'and/or taking the rubber ball out of the mouse (should be directions' b'in the manual or on the bottom of the mouse) and cleaning it with' b'alcohol (isopropyl, i believe the same alcohol as used for cleaning' b'your cassette deck). this is good to do every so often, even if you' b'have a mouse pad. dust still gets caught in the mouse and on the' b"rubber ball. as well, lint and other garbage may find it's way onto" b'the rubber ball and get into the mouse damaging the horizontal and' b'vertical sensors.' b'' b'hope this helps. good luck.' b'' b'--' b'sincerely,' b'' b'' b'"in theory, theory and practice are the same. in practice, they are not."' b'"you mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision' b'revised?!?!"'
