b'' b'a professor of mine once said "the difference between a computer engineer and' b'a computer scientist is about meaning the engineer makes more than' b'the cs.' b'seriously though the main difference is that most cs people write programs that' b'people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an' b'engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the "computer" in your' b'car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. in other words' b'cs writes software while cse writes firmware.' b'these are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.' b'' b'p.s. the is not just a joke' b'scott' b'' b"for the most part, this is a bunch of bunk. i've got a computer engineering" b"degree, yet i've spent the last years writing software that people actually" b'use. moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; i received job offers' b'upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were' b'$7000/year lower! my advice is to decide which classes and projects most' b'interest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them.' b'' b'_emt'
