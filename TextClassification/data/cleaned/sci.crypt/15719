b'' b' first, note that the "experts" will only look at "details", and of just' b' the algorithm:' b'' b' in addition, respected experts from outside the' b' government will be offered access to the confidential details of' b' the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report' b' their findings.' b'' b" why not the chip design? well, here's the possiblity: in addition to" b' encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier' b' to analyze/transcribe electronically. the chip, once widespread, might' b' effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for "voice-' b' grepping" the us phone network (or the criminal wrong-thinking patrons' b' thereof).' b'' b"first of all, the chip doesn't do that. it runs at megabits/second," b"which is far beyond what you need for voice. it's obviously intended" b'for data as well, and on high-speed lines at that.' b'' b'second what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone?' b"i don't care how fancy that chip is; it's not as fancy as the roomful" b"of analyzers at fort meade running the program they'll have years from" b"now. they can't update every clipper chip that's out there." b'' b'third if they did do this preprocessing in the chip, it would probably' b'have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns. if' b'nothing else, that would hurt the acceptability of the product. the' b'v.32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly-' b"massaged voice as is; add any more to the mix, and you're completely out" b'of the ballpark.'
