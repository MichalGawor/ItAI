b'' b'' b'[much bs deleted for brevity]' b'' b'again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to "sell"' b'readers on our products (which would conflict with the "no-ads"' b'philosophy of usenet). nor do we necessarily have access to info' b'that others have.' b'' b'it certainly smacks of that! remember the "poll" that you quoted saying that' b'you had seen a of users being satisfied with dos care to recall how' b'unbiased the sample set was? that post sure looked like fud....and coming' b'from a microsoftie well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.' b'' b'if i recall, jen said right up front how the sample set was derived.' b"where's the fud?" b'' b'' b'advocacy is good but spreading fud to advocate your favorite os is very' b'unethical especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that' b'os.' b'' b'does this mean i can flame you if i ever see you doing it?' b'face it the .advocacy groups are _for_ the kind of things that' b"you're preaching against. this is why they were created in the first" b'place to filter out all the crap from the newsgroups that might' b'contain real information.' b'' b'-phil' b'--' b'nothing i have posted here is in any way, shape, or form official' b'microsoft policy or opinion, and should not be represented as such when' b'quoted here or in any other forum.'
