b'' b"the internal hd in my lc disappeared for a day last week, and i'd like to" b'hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.' b'' b'it is an lc, with 10mb of ram and an 80mb internal drive, running system' b'7.1, with a few scsi devices in a (so far as i know) properly terminated' b'chain.' b'' b'i had shut down the system for a day-- i was out of town and we sometimes' b'have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking' b'question mark. i booted from a floppy and saw that my external hd seemed' b'okay, but there was no sign of the internal.' b'' b'i installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot' b'from it. i tried things like disk first aid and silverlining, to inquire' b'about the internal drive. they either could not find it or got errors in' b'trying to talk to it. (silverlining claimed it was a connor drive, but it' b'is a quantum... b'' b"well, i'd backed things up, so i was able to work. but, at some point i" b'noticed that the internal had reappeared. now, disk first aid says that' b"all's well, etc. things seem to be fine." b'' b'but, what happened? was this a warning that something (the internal hd' b"or something else) is about to die? i'm definitely nervous." b'' b'and, if this is a signal that the internal hd is sick, is it true that i' b'can only put up to a 127mb drive inside an lc? some folks have claimed' b"there's a limitation in the lc (other'n size or power) while others (and" b'that includes lacie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.' b'' b'thanks for answers.'
