b'' b'' b'' b'request for opinions:' b'' b'which is better a one-piece aerostitch or a two-piece aerostitch?' b'' b'' b'we\'re looking for more than "well, the 2-pc is more versatile, but the' b'1-pc is better protection,..."' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'nadine' b'' b'' b'what is best? books have been written on that! but in regard to' b'aerostich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.' b'if you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero' b'dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching' b'the piece suit. i have the piece suit and i am very happy with it.' b'having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, i am very' b'concerned with good protection and i believe that the difference in' b'protection between the and piece suits is almost negligible. i' b'think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a' b'difference. one thing that is nice about the piece is if you go' b'somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)' b'you can just detach and stow the pants.' b'' b'one thing to note is that goldfine has problems getting a good fit for' b'many women (with standard suits). supposedly for smaller women (and' b'petite men for that matter) the piece will fit better.' b'' b'another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. i wish i' b'got inches added to my pant legs. i find the long suits are not' b"really that long (i can't imagine how short the standard suits must" b'be).' b'' b'--' b'encore computer corp, kildaire farm rd, cary, nc usa' b'919-481-3730/voice \t\t\t\t919-481-3868/fax'
