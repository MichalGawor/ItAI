b'' b'as of yet, there has been no description of the general principles' b'behind the clipper proposal. for example, is this a public key system' b"or a private key system? if the latter, then i don't see how the" b'system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and' b'not the person).' b'' b'further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks.' b'i would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks' b'and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic.' b"i'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system," b'but it does make you think. of course, this is easily fixable by' b'giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the' b'real 80-bit key.' b'' b'philip'
