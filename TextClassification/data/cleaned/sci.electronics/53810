b'' b'' b'hi all,' b'' b"i'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in columbus. i'd" b'like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to' b'use cue tapes to bring the houselights up. our current automation' b"consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function." b'' b'we already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,' b'and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control' b'circuit vac) is momentarily closed, for at least second.' b'' b"i've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12v relay, activated when the" b"cue tape completes the circuit. low tech and simple, but there's one" b'problem: in order to get the second pulse, there needs to be' b'a sh**load of cuetape on the film. (35mm runs at feet per minute,' b'so to get a second pulse, there needs to be at least inches of solid' b'cuetape!)' b'' b'ideally, i would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.' b'(a single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)' b'this would give a pulse of approximately of a second.' b'what i need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay' b'for around second. the ability to adjust how long the relay' b'is activated would be nice. i figure this would require an rc circuit' b"of some sort. i'm sure some of you already have the solution figured" b'out in your heads. any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!' b'' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'mark fontana' b'' b'--' b'"of all the arts, the cinema is mark a. fontana' b'the most important." computer and information science' b'--v.i. lenin the ohio state university'
