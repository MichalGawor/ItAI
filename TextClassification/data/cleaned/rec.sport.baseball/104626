b'' b'as a touter of braves prospects, all i can say is that, imo,' b'someone on the braves roster is about to become pipped.' b"it may not even be hunter. but i think they'll have a" b"problem getting klesko out of the lineup once he's in." b'' b"well, this may be good news. if klesko hits, i'd look for bream to be" b'traded (if possible) or released, since bream is also a lefthander. hope' b'klesko hits.' b'' b'according to the atlanta paper, bream will be the full-time first baseman' b'with klesko used as a late-inning defensive replacement if bream is lifted' b"for a pinch-runner. he'd have to hit a homer in his first ab (or win the" b'game or do some other amazing thing) to be rewarded with a start so he could' b'even attempt to push hunter or bream out of the lineup.' b'---------------+' b'kurt in atlanta' b'politics: from the greek poli many; tics ugly, blood-sucking parasites'
