b'' b'disclaimer this is for fun.' b'' b'in my computerized baseball game, i keep track of a category called' b'"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not' b'make with average effort." using the defensive averages posted' b"by sherri nichols (thanks sherri!), i've figured out some defensive stats" b'for the centerfielders. hits stolen have been redefined as "plays juan' b'gonzalez would not have made."' b'' b"ok, i realize that's unfair. juan's probably the victim of pitching staff," b"fluke shots, and a monster park factor. but let's put it this way: if we" b"replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with kevin's out" b'making ability, how many extra hits would go by?' b'' b"to try and correlate it to reality a little more, i've calculated net" b'hits stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league' b"average fielder would make. by the same method i've calculated net extra" b'bases (doubles and triples let by).' b'' b'finally, i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution, or' b'dcon basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.' b'i add this number to ops to get dops (defense onbase plus slug), which' b"should represent the player's total contribution to the team. so don't" b'take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this' b'article.' b'' b'the short version definition of terms' b'hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell' b'nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder' b'ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder' b'neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder' b'dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented, as a rate.' b"dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player's total contribution." b'' b'national league' b'' b'name hs nhs neb dcon dops' b'nixon, o. b'grissom, m. b'jackson, d. b'lewis, d. b'dykstra, l. b'dascenzo, d. b'finley, s. b'lankford, r. b'martinez, d. b'vanslyke, a. b'sanders, r. b'butler, b. b'johnson, h. b'' b'ordered by dops' b'' b'.846 vanslyke' b'.844 lankford' b'.812 grissom' b'.794 dykstra' b'.777 nixon' b'.759 finley' b'.759 sanders' b'.735 jackson' b'.730 *nl average*' b'.716 butler' b'.660 martinez' b'.616 dascenzo' b'.596 lewis' b'.548 johnson' b'' b'american league' b'---------------' b'' b'name hs nhs neb dcon dops' b'lofton, k. b'wilson, w. b'white, d. b'felix, j. b'devereaux, m. b'mcrae, h. b'yount, r. b'kelly, r. b'johnson, l. b'griffey, k. b'puckett, k. b'cuyler, m. b'gonzalez, j. b'' b'' b'order by dops' b'' b'.947 lofton' b'.844 griffey' b'.832 devereaux' b'.812 white' b'.801 puckett' b'.787 wilson' b'.738 gonzalez' b'.737 yount' b'.713 felix' b'.709 *al average*' b'.681 kelly' b'.641 johnson' b'.631 mcrae' b'.503 cuyler' b'' b'more discussion b'' b'dcon formula: ((nhs ndp)/pa) ((nhs ndp neb)/ab)' b"why such a bizzare formula? basically, it's designed to be added into the" b'ops, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored".' b'the extra outs are factored into obp, while the extra bases removed are' b"factored into slg. that's why i used pa and ab as the divisors." b'' b'for more discussion see the post on hits stolen first base b'--' b'' b'"it is considered good to look wise, especially when not' b'overburdened with information" j. golden kimball'
