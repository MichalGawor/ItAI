b'' b'i just started reading this thread today, so forgive me if it has already been' b"mentioned. but...what was the deal with renault's putting the horn on the" b'left-hand turn-signal stalk? it was a button on the end, where the washer' b'button would be on the wiper/washer stalk. could the frenchies not figure' b'out the wiring through the steering wheel, or what?' b'' b"had an alliance for a long time. it was a comfortable but sluggish" b'car. i got very used to the horn on the stalk, after a couple months worth' b'of getting used to it. after i bought my next car, a chevy, it took me' b'for-ever to get used to the horn on the steering wheel again!' b'' b'jim grey' b'' b'up the irons!'
