b'' b'several replies to my post have said that i should get to know' b'christian homosexuals before judging them. i maintain that i was not' b'judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong. i would like to' b'look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical' b'evaluation of the people who responded to the side of christianity' b'and homosexuality being compatible (admitedly not all are homosexuals' b"but i know that many are from their e-mail responces). i don't" b'normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but' b'since i have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point i will.' b'' b"so far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because i don't" b'have the resources of others, and even reverted to name calling. if' b"you don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you" b'who are homosexual christians show me the diffrence.' b'' b"in christ's love," b'bryan'
