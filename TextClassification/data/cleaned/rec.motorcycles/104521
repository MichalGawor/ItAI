b'' b' hi, i have an cb750 custom that i just replaced the cylinder head gasket' b" on. now when i put it back together again, it wouldn't idle at all. it was" b' only running on cylinders and it would backfire and spit flames out the' b' exhaust on the right side. the exhaust is mac. i bought new plugs' b" today and it runs very rough and still won't idle. i am quite sure the fine" b' tune knobs on the carbs are messed up. i checked the timing, it was fine, so' b" i advanced it a little and that didn't help." b'' b' i assume the carbs need to be synched. can i buy a kit and do this myself?' b' if so, what kit is the best for the price.' b'' b' any other suggestions?' b'' b'i dont think its the carbs that are out, i would suspect that' b'the cam timing is out, as you say that you had the head off, that' b'would make sense to me,' b'ian.' b'' b"just my emu's worth." b'--' b'ian deeley \t\t\t\t"...whatever you do will be' b'school of engineering\t |\t\tinsignificant, but its very' b'university of sussex \t--=ooo=--\timportant that you do it.."' b'england.\t\t\t\t\tanon'
