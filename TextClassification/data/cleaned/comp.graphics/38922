b'' b"i'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. what i want to do is" b'the following;' b'' b'from a fast source, eg. a cdrom, several sound sources are read, each having' b"it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc. given the" b'listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the' b'listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction. this' b"means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's" b'incoming direction have to be done for each sound source. (i think this is' b'possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles' b'relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given' b'angle. this impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the' b'source. this impulse function must be changed every time some sound source' b'changes position or the listener changes orientation.) additionally some' b'reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined' b'could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation' b'simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.' b'' b'have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system?' b'' b'please post or mail any answers or comments.' b'' b'--' b'torgeir veimo' b'' b'studying at the university of bergen' b'' b'"...i\'m gona wave my freak flag high!"
