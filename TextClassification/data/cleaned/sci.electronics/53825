b'' b'' b'i had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,' b'to put both machines on one line. you order distinctive' b'ringing from your phone company. this is $3/month here.' b'you get a second (unpublished) phone number. when' b'someone calls this number, your phone rings with short' b'rings instead of long rings.' b'' b'you set up your answering machine on rings and your fax' b"on six rings. you'd give out the new as your fax b'a device would measure the length of rings. when it' b'detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.' b'five rings later your fax picks up the call.' b'' b'this should be cheaper and more elegant than the b'switches now available.' b'' b"but that's not what i did. i'm giving out the new" b'# to my friends and customers. this should leave the' b"old for telemarketers, etc. i won't pick up the" b'phone when i hear the long rings.' b'--' b'"why my thoughts are my own, when they are in, but when they are out' b'they are another\'s." susannah martin, hanged for witchcraft,
