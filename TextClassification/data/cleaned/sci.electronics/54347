b'' b'' b" \ti'm trying to bring in bits to a pc, and would like" b' \tto use interrupt-driven routines. without buying an io' b' \tboard or making a new port, _where_ can i bring in these' b" \tbits? lpt seems to have only a few inputs, but i've heard" b' \trumours that some lpts have bidirectional lines. anybody' b' \tknow fer sure? if any bi-d lpts, which boards have them' b" \t(i'll be running a new 386dx-33)?" b'' b'i know for sure that the everex magic i/o ev-170a can be jumpered' b'for a printer mode, or for a general purpose bidirectional i/o mode.' b'' b'also, i know for sure that the ibm technical reference says the following' b'about the monochrome display printer adapter and the ibm parallel printer' b'adapter:' b'' b'it is essential that the external device not try to pull these' b'lines [referring to the data lines] to ground.' b'' b'and later:' b'' b'if an external device should be driving data on these pins (in' b'violation of usage ground rules) at the time of an input, this' b"data will be `or'ed with the latch contents." b'' b'i will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind' b'as a result of my saying, ``i do not know for sure, but i think' b'you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input' b'port by writing 0x to the data lines, and then reading from the' b"data lines, while an external device drives them.'' the input" b'data will not be latched, so noise could make this infeasible.' b'' b'todd' b'' b''
