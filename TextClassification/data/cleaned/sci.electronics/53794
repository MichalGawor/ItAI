b'' b'anyway, over the weekend, i was resting on the sofa (in between chores),' b'and noticed that i briefly picked up what sounded like ham radio traffic' b'over my stereo and television, even though both were off. also, all the' b'touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko, cycling through' b'their four brightness states.' b'' b'i presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past' b'my house (i live on a busy thoroughfare); would this be a correct presumption?' b'what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects?' b'the affected equipment is about feet from the road...' b'' b'hams can legally run up to watts. it is very unlikely, however,' b'that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car. ham rigs' b'for cars put out around watts. it is possible that a watt' b'radio would cause interference to consumer electronic feet' b'away. most tvs, stereos, and vcrs have very poor rf shielding.' b'if you experience the problem frequently, it may be' b'caused by a ham, cber, or other radio operator in a base station' b'nearby. the interference may have been caused by a radio' b'transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,' b'etc. if you heard voices over your stereo, i think you are' b'correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter.' b'' b'if you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the rf ferrite' b'chokes available at radio shack. the interference is probably' b'being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can' b'be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).' b'good instructions are included with the chokes.' b'if that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your' b'neighborhood for a radio operator. look for antennas on the roof' b'or car. talk to him/her about your problem. there are things' b'a radio operator can do to reduce interference.' b'' b'--' b'' b'=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=' b'randall rhea informix software, inc.' b'project manager, mis sales/marketing systems uunet!pyramid!infmx!randall'
