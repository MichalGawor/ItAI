b'' b'' b'i noticed ati had posted *beta* avi drivers for their mach32 boards on' b'compuserve.. has anyone had the chance tgo try them?' b'' b'how well do they work?' b'' b'very well indeed. at home (a vl bus version of the graphics pro) i can stretch' b'an avi window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly. it drops' b'a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean' b'one frame update every seconds. an isa graphics+ was able to do "zoom by' b'2" without any perceptible performance penalty. it is the best performance' b"i've seen so far with the possible exception of an intel indeo board (which" b"uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the isa" b'bus at any point).' b'' b'john munsch'
