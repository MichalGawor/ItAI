b'' b' b' team biggest biggest' b' team: mvp: surprise: disappointment:' b' b' philadelphia flyers lindros/recchi fedyk/galley eklund' b'' b" fence-sitting...look at philly's record with eric and without..." b' there is no doubt. soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.' b'' b"re eric: true, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be" b'like without recchi for games.' b'' b'soderstrom: absolutely. shutouts in games for a rookie without a lot' b'of defense in front of him. runnerups to galley and fedyk who are scoring' b"a ton over their career best. but galley thinks he's paul coffey (puts scoring" b'ahead of defending) and fedyk has tailed off big time.' b'' b'eklund: was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. b"points in games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor" b"in the wins they've gotten. eklund has never had a point a game season in" b'his career, his production is very typical for him. how does he qualify as' b"a disappointment? if anything he's a surprise." b'' b'my choice would be roussel if i went strictly by what was expected of players,' b'but i never thought that he had what it takes to be a goalie. my biggest' b'disappointment is bill dineen. i thought that he was going to be the perfect' b"coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and imho" b'has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. any' b'coach that thinks putting eric lindros at the point on power plays is a' b'bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.' b'' b'pete clark jr rsh flyers contact and mailing list owner'
