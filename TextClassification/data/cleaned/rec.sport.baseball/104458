b'' b'} the roar at michigan and trumbull should be loader than ever this year. with' b'} mike illitch at the head and ernie harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats' b'} will bang this summer. already they have scored runs in two games and with' b'} fielder, tettleton, and deer i think they can win the division. no pitching!' b'} bull! gully, moore, wells, and krueger make up a decent staff that will keep' b'} the team into many games. then there is henneman to close it out. watch out' b'} boston, toronto, and baltimore the motor city kittys are back.' b'' b'nice woofing (or should i say meowing?).' b'and yes, the tiggers are a fun, exciting team that i would pay to see.' b'but last year, they went this year, their offense is essentially' b'the same, and their pitching is, at best, essentially the same. so why' b'do you think they will suddenly improve to win the or so games which will' b"be required to win the a.l. east? what has changed that i don't see?" b'' b'remember, a win is worth as much in the standings as a win...' b'' b'-*-' b'charles'
