b'' b'' b'i love it how all of these people are "blaming" the phillies success' b"on a weak division. why don't we look at the record of the teams in" b"each division (read: inter-divisional play), we'll see that the east" b'is really kicking the shit out of the west. i know it is early, but' b'that is all we have to go on. atlanta is just so strong with their' b".188 ba, cincinnati is coming off a sweep at veteran's stadium in" b"philadelphia, and houston was swept in it's first three games by the" b'phillies in the astrodome. that, my western division friends, shows' b'that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you' b'think!!' b'' b'or you may be posting this way too early and be eating your words by' b"mid-season. c'mon, the phillies haven't proved anything yet. atlanta" b'was similar to the phils years ago. they sucked. they started having' b"a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the" b'division. (which is how it should be) so until the phils at least' b"have a good year, not just a good weeks, they won't get any respect" b"either. btw, atlanta's ba is actually a compliment to how good" b'the braves really are. their record is can you imagine the phils' b"record if they were batting hahahaha. and atlanta's hitting will" b'improve dramatically.' b"no, i'm not a braves fan. just defending a good team." b'orin.' b'bradley u.' b'' b"phils all the way in b'braves hit like a aaa club' b'reds need marge' b'' b'\t\t\t\t\t\t-bob' b'--' b"i'm really a jester in disguise!"
