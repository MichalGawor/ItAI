b'' b'not that the question is anything important, but i am still curious:' b'why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green? i have seen' b'a few blue ones, but no red, yellow, company logo etc. is there a' b'technical reason or could it be that the marketing "geniuses" have' b'not tought about it (yet)?' b'' b"it's possible to make boards in other colors, and i have an ad" b'for laser light-show equipment which offers the circuit boards in your' b'choice of day-glo (tm) colors.' b'' b'the usual light green color is just the natural color of fiberglas.' b'the dark green or blue is the solder mask layer, and i suspect that color' b'is a dye.' b'' b'john nagle'
