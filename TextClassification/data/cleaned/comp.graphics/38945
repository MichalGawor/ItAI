b'' b'' b'2) yes xv is an bit program. this is not a bug.' b'' b'never claimed it is a bug.' b'' b'' b'xv can import bit images and quantises them down to bits. this is a handy' b'facility, not a bug.' b'' b'never claimed it is a bug.' b'' b'' b'how would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file? how' b"would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? only global" b'changes could be done unless the software were very different and' b'much more complicated.' b'if you want to do colour editing on a bit image, you need much' b'more powerfull software which is readily available commercially.' b'' b'i guess i edited my note on this away from the article i posted to' b'many newsgroups.' b'' b'i wrote something about making color modifications quickly' b'with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file' b'process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.' b'this makes sense, because the main use of xv is only viewing images.' b'' b'doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications' b'in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,' b'we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.' b'' b'' b'and lastly, jpeg is a compression algorithm. it can be applied to any' b'image of arbitrary bit depth. again, this is not a bug.' b'' b'never claimed it is a bug.' b"i tried kept sure i don't claim that jpeg is noting else than" b'a compression algorithm, because i know what the jpeg is.' b'(you propably misunderstood what i wrote as you have done in many' b'places so far.)' b'' b'you also missed what is (were) wrong with xv. however, i did wrote it.' b'' b'' b'juhana kouhia'
