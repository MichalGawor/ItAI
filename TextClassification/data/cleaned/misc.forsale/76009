b'' b'dear fellow usenet users:' b'' b'i would like to give a formal apology for posting an advertisement' b'about my printing business. i did not intend this to be an advertisement,' b'but rather an offer for people on the usenet, many of whom use printing' b'on a regular basis. i was not aware that this is not "legal" on the usenet.' b'i am only trying to put myself through college. for those of you who' b'requested information, i will write to you privately. for those of you who' b'are having fun flooding my mailbox, i think you can grow up. to offer advice' b'is one thing, but to use profanity toward me is another.' b'' b'thank you,' b''
