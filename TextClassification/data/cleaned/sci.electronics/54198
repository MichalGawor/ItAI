b'' b' hi. i was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology' b' paper, and i read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the' b' tv screen at 1/200ths of a second. is that possible?' b'' b' might' b'even be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit' b"on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited)." b'' b'back in high school i worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental' b'psychologists at bell labs. when they were doing visual perception and' b'memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond' b'refresh rates common.' b'' b'so your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were' b'probably sure that it was milliseconds, not or either.' b'' b'' b'steve' b'--' b'unc chapel hill computer science w: carrboro nc b'engineering is a _lot_ like art: some circuits are like lyric poems, some' b"are like army manuals, and some are like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.."
