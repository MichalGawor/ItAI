b'' b'' b'i was watching the dodgers/marlins game yesterday and a couple of' b'things impressed me.' b'' b'first is that the way the sun was shining in miami, it had a summer' b'atmosphere in early spring for baseball. in comparison wrigley field' b'in early april still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and' b'bundled up fans.' b'' b'the second and most important was the fans. i like these guys/gals!' b'i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball.' b'it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to' b'the miami dolphins. the way they were cheering, i thought it was the' b'afc playoffs. of course opening day may have a lot to do with it,' b'but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with' b'a lot of baseball fans in other cities.' b'' b'baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion' b"teams bring back some excitement. we'll find out friday how denver" b'bronco fans respond.' b'' b'phillies are (i better say it now before my opportunity passes' b'by)'
