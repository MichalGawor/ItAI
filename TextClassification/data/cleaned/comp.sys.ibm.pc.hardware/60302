b'' b'when i changed my motherboard i had a lot of trouble getting' b'led,spkr,turbo,turboswitch,hdd,klck,rst, connectors correctly' b'reconnected. for example turbo switch had three wires and' b'the motherboard connection only two pins... and so on.' b'' b'does anyone know a solution to this. do i need to rewire the' b'connectors or what is the best way to approach this.' b'it is somewhat frustrating. i got it to work somehow but my turbo' b"switch doesn't work at all." b'' b'' b'i just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.' b'my cents worth:' b'' b'the speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker.' b"a speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference" b'which way you attach.' b'' b'turbo switch. there are three wires to control how you want turbo' b'to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out. i think' b'the middle wire is common. use an ohm meter to figure out which wire' b'connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two' b'wires are connected when the switch is out. place the appropriate' b'two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.' b'' b"led's: (turbo and hd) led's are uni directional. depending which" b'way the wires are attached the led will not light. on my ami motherboard,' b'if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the' b'board, the board will power up in default in turbo mode. if your motherboard' b"is like that... just attace the led wires to the board. if the led doesn't" b'light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again. it should work.' b'' b'if it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.' b'' b'hope this helps.' b'' b'dan moyer' b''
