b'' b'' b' the detroit red wings put a lot of doubter on ice tonight with a b'washing of the toronto maple leafs. all you toronto fans have now seen the' b"power of the mighty red wing offense. toronto's defense in no match for the" b'wing offense. as for the defense, probert, kennedey and primeau came out' b'' b'did they move probert back to defense? why did i see him parking his ass' b'in front of potvin all night? somebody is going to have to discipline' b'probert if the leafs want to win the series. perhaps a fresh clark should' b'hit the ice at the end of a long probert shift and straigten him out for' b'a while...' b'' b'' b'--' b'' b'"so many morons...' b'rm ...and so little time."'
