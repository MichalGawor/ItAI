b'' b'' b'[about scanning clipper and reverse-engineering the algorithm]' b'am i missing something obvious here? what could have the government done' b'to address this possibility? do they really care if it stays classified?' b'' b"\tyeah, you're missing the obvious fact that since the algorithm" b'is classified, if you reverse engineer it from the chip, and later' b"publish it, or build a compatible chip, you're divulging classified" b'information and are in a big load of trouble.' b'' b"i don't think they can do that without changing the law. the chip itself" b"isn't classified, and reverse engineering is allowed by law (possibly)" b'unless prohibited by a valid contract. the algorithm may be classified,' b'but there are many court cases ruling that information identical to' b'classfied information, but obtained from unclassified sources, is freely' b'publishable (with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information.)' b'--' b'my opinions are my own, and do not represent those of my employer.'
