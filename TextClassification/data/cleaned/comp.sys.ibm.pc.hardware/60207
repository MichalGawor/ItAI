they do not seem to have any problems at all. i consider' b'these people lucky. others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.' b'' b'3. in my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is' b'to upgrade to aspi4dos the scsiha.sys driver is no longer' b'needed. unfortunately, while you could get previous aspi4dos' b'upgrades from the adaptec bbs, the aspi4dos driver is not' b'available from the adaptec bbs. as far as i know, there are only' b'three ways to get a copy:' b'' b'* you can buy the new (as of november adaptec ez scsi driver' b'kit, which supposedly includes aspi4dos as well as other' b'drivers, such as cdrom drivers. i believe the list price is' b'around b'' b'* if you already have a copy of an older version of aspi4dos, you' b'can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for' b'around b'' b'* a copy of aspi4dos is included in central point pc tools b'for msdos. note that the documentation and driver are stored in' b'different directories. note further that only aspi4dos is' b'included; the cdrom drivers and drivers to support more than two' b'hard disks are not included. this is where i obtained my copy' b'of aspi4dos b'' b'note, however, that i am now getting occasional parity errors with' b'windows. in all probability, defective hardware in my pc is causing' b'this, as i upgraded my motherboard just after i found the above' b'solutions. however, because these parity errors occur only during disk' b'accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the' b'parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off' b"timing for certain disk transfers might cause this). i've run various" b'memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no' b'problems. this problem is probably caused by memory with marginal' b'timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers' b"(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems the problems" b"show up only under disk i/o). however, i'm mentioning this just in case" b"it isn't a hardware problem." b'' b'' b'***** floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:' b'' b'there are two possible problems with using the adaptec with a' b'floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the colorado memory' b'systems jumbo b'' b'1. tape backups/restores can take a very long time. the tape drive' b'constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.' b'' b'2. tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.' b'(this problem might be caused by defective hardware on my b"however, i've heard of other people having similar problems, and so" b"i'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my" b'1542.)' b'' b'' b'* tape backups/restores take a long time:' b'' b'if you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may' b'have to adjust the adaptec "bus on/off timing" for best' b'results when using the tape drive. normally, while doing a tape backup' b'or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with' b'only an occasional pause. however, the default bus timing on the' b'adaptec may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,' b'start and stop, every few seconds. this causes needless wear to the' b'tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective' b'tape drive can also cause this make sure your tape heads are clean).' b'this also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer' b'than necessary.' b'' b'the problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy dma to' b'transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the adaptec uses dma' b'to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk. the floppy dma needs' b'to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is' b'not fed data quickly enough by the floppy dma, the tape drive stops,' b'rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).' b'the default bus timing on the adaptec (which is really dma timing) is' b'"too large". for example, when a backup is done, data has to be' b'transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the' b'tape. because the default timing on the adaptec "hogs" the memory too' b'much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to' b'memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the' b'tape drive. as a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,' b'because data is not fed to it quickly enough.' b'' b"the solution is to change the adaptec's bus on/off timing. the" b'default factory setting is microseconds on, and microseconds off.' b'the "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to microseconds. this can' b'be done in one of two ways:' b'' b'* if you have aspi4dos, you can use the "/n" option. for example, i use' b'a "bus on" timing of microseconds, which means that i use the' b'following line in my config.sys file:' b'' b'device=c:\\aspi4dos.sys /n4' b'' b'note that there is no space between the "/n" and the b'' b"* if you don't have aspi4dos, your only recourse is to try to find a" b'program called "setscsi.exe", which is very difficult to find. the' b'reason is that adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to' b'want this widely distributed. i once asked someone who worked for' b'adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere. if you have' b'anonymous ftp access to the internet, you could try using archie to' b'hunt down a copy; i believe that there are a couple of sites that have' b'it. if you do find a copy, you run it like so:' b'' b'setscsi -n:4' b'' b'this adjusts the "bus on" timing to microseconds. running' b'setscsi.exe without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the' b'factory defaults.' b'' b'note that it seems that you cannot use setscsi.exe if you use' b'aspi4dos; setscsi.exe crashed my system if aspi4dos was loaded. i' b'could use setscsi.exe with scsiha.sys, however.' b'' b'do not lower the "bus on" timing below microseconds, or increase it' b'above microseconds. if you lower it too low, the hard disk' b'throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower. for me, b'microseconds works fine. this value may work fine for you, or you may' b'have to adjust it downwards a little.' b'' b'once you\'ve lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores' b'should run faster.' b'' b'also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other' b'options that i have intentionally not described), unless you know what' b'you are doing. bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by' b'starving memory refresh.' b'' b'a program called bustifix.exe exists on the adaptec bbs. unless' b'this has been upgraded since i last checked (which has been a while),' b'this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple' b'of other files. this batch file was supposed to allow one to set the' b'bus on/off times for the and others. however, when i tried' b'running this program with my 1542a, my system crashed. at the time, i' b"was running scsiha.sys, and i didn't check to see if there was a" b'conflict with it. maybe this old program works only with the 1542b,' b'although the docs say that it works with the 1542a?' b'' b'' b'* erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:' b'' b'this "problem" may or may not exist. although it existed on my' b'system, a hardware problem just on my particular could cause it.' b"however, i've heard of other people having similar problems, and so i'm" b"mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my" b'1542.' b'' b'symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the' b'tape head:' b'' b'1. backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,' b'resulting in an aborted tape backup.' b'' b'2. tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.' b'' b'3. the tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.' b'unlike the above-mentioned problem ("tape backups/restores take a' b'long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,' b'this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few seconds or so.' b'' b'4. fastback plus does not find/see any tape backup devices. other' b'programs, like central point backup and the cms jumbo software' b'(assuming that you have a cms jumbo tape drive) can find/see the' b'tape drive, but fastback plus cannot.' b'' b'5. too many tape read errors.' b'' b'although i do not know what is causing this problem, i discovered' b'that using a different floppy controller solves it. a few months ago, i' b'upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy' b'controller. as i already had a floppy controller on the i' b'initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller. after a while, i' b'decided to try disabling the floppy controller and using the one on' b'the motherboard. when i did this, the tape drive (a cms jumbo b'reliability increased dramatically, and fastback plus was suddenly' b'able to find and use the tape drive.' b'' b"i don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my b'on the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached' b'to the which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the' b"1542. on the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to" b'the floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different' b'controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my' b'1542. i did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that' b"the problem was in the cables. i don't know what the cause really is;" b"however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider" b'trying a new floppy controller.' b'' b'' b'***** sound cards:' b'' b'many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and' b'this is typically done using dma. like the tape drive dma, the' b"adaptec's dma can conflict with the sound card dma. unlike that of the" b'tape dma, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error' b'(your system crashes with a parity error message). what happens is' b'that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the' b'adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a' b'parity error. usually, getting a parity error means that there is a' b'hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity' b'error is not a symptom of bad hardware.' b'' b"i've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording" b'digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase' b'the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,' b'recording using 16-bits instead of etc.).' b'' b'like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the' b'adaptec\'s "bus on" timing. see the section on tape drives for' b'information on how this is done. note, however, that this may or may' b'not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity' b'error. the software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect' b'this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient). disk caches, the' b'speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also' b'affect this.' b'' b'' b'***** miscellaneous info:' b'' b'this section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors. much' b"of it is merely information that i've heard or read about, and have not" b"verified. i believe that the following information is correct, but i'm" b'not sure. use it at your own risk.' b'' b'* with qemm and you need to specify the "db="' b'parameter (e.g., "db=2"), unless you are using the aspi4dos driver.' b"if you don't, qemm will crash/hang at bootup. although the qemm" b'manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that' b'a is present and automatically add this option to the qemm' b'command line (at least, this occurred with the qemm install' b"program i haven't tested any other version). earlier versions of" b"qemm probably need this parameter, but i'm not sure (i've never used a" b'version earlier than b'' b'if you use aspi4dos, you do not need to give qemm the "db=" parameter.' b'' b'* some or all versions of the do not support hard disks over one' b'gigabyte in size. to support hard disks with capacities over 1gb, you' b"need to get a new rom bios from adaptec. i'm not sure if this is" b'still true of the latest 1542bs being sold by adaptec.' b'' b'* to connect a cdrom drive to the you need a scsi cdrom drive and' b'some drivers. note that some cdrom drives have proprietary interfaces' b'(non-scsi);
