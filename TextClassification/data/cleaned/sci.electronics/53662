b'' b' there are two simple procedures for alterating any odometer.' b'' b'1. mechanical driven odometer:' b' remove the speedo cable from the transmission.' b' attach a drill and run at max speed until the speedo turns over.' b' continue until the desired mileage is reached.' b'====================================' b'admittedly an irrelavent question:for how long should the drill be running?' b'' b'bijan' b'' b'a verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days. i had the pleasure of' b'doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my b&d heavy duty at' b'full speed rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was mph. now if you go' b'a high speed drill and ran it at say rpm, you could get mph out of' b"it. (if you speedo doesn't burn out.) anyways, to roll a mile" b'odometer would take days or so. much easier just to take the speedo' b'apart.' b'' b"thought i'd share. btw, all this info was obtained legally b'' b'' b'--' b'(~)~)~) o computer lesson one: there is no "any" key, alternate keys' b'/ are <shift,<ctrl,<caps lock,<alt' b'/ and sometimes <tab.'
