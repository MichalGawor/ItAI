b'' b'disclaimer this is for fun.' b'' b'in my computerized baseball game, i keep track of a category called' b'"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not' b'make with average effort." using the defensive averages posted' b"by sherri nichols (thanks sherri!), i've figured out some defensive stats" b'for the leftfielders. hits stolen have been redefined as "plays kevin' b'bass would not have made."' b'' b"ok, i realize that's unfair. kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff," b"fluke shots, and a monster park factor. but let's put it this way: if we" b"replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with kevin's out" b'making ability, how many extra hits would go by?' b'' b"to try and correlate it to reality a little more, i've calculated net" b'hits stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league' b"average fielder would make. by the same method i've calculated net extra" b'bases (doubles and triples let by).' b'' b'finally, i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution, or' b'dcon basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.' b'i add this number to ops to get dops (defense onbase plus slug), which' b"should represent the player's total contribution to the team. so don't" b'take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this' b'article.' b'' b'the short version definition of terms' b'hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell' b'nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder' b'ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder' b'neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder' b'dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented, as a rate.' b"dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player's total contribution." b'' b'national league' b'' b'name hs nhs neb dcon dops' b'gonzalez, l. b'gilkey, b. b'clark, g. b'alou, m. b'bonds, b. b'may, d. b'gant, r. b'bass, k. b'' b'ordered by dops' b'' b'1.099 bonds' b'.941 gilkey' b'.866 gonzalez' b'.835 alou' b'.726 clark' b'.718 *nl average*' b'.715 gant' b'.659 may' b'.600 bass' b'' b'' b'american league' b'---------------' b'' b'name hs nhs neb dcon dops' b'raines, t. b'anderson, b. b'henderson, r. b'vaughn, g. b'gladden, d. b'hall, m. b'mack, s. b'polonia, l. b'mcreynolds, k. b'maldanado, c. b'reimer, k. b'' b'' b'order by dops' b'' b'.984 henderson' b'.924 anderson' b'.896 raines' b'.866 mack' b'.817 vaughn' b'.756 hall' b'.733 *al average*' b'.714 maldanado' b'.711 mcreynolds' b'.699 gladden' b'.671 reimer' b'.647 polonia' b'' b'more discussion b'' b'dcon formula: ((nhs ndp)/pa) ((nhs ndp neb)/ab)' b"why such a bizzare formula? basically, it's designed to be added into the" b'ops, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored".' b'the extra outs are factored into obp, while the extra bases removed are' b"factored into slg. that's why i used pa and ab as the divisors." b'' b'for more discussion see the post on hits stolen first base b'--' b'' b'"it is considered good to look wise, especially when not' b'overburdened with information" j. golden kimball'
