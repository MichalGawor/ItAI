b'' b'now can we please use rec.scouting for the purpose for which it was' b'established? clearly we netnews voters decided that we did not want to' b'provide a scouting newsgroup to give fringe groups a forum for their' b'anti-societal political views.' b'' b'ok, this is the only thing i will comment on from stan at this time...' b'part of this forum we call rec.scouting is for policy discussions and' b'related topics. this is a policy discussion, and involves related' b'topics. this is not a "fringe" group discussion. obviously, it' b'engenders strong feelings from all sides of the issues at hand.' b'wether a particular view is anti-societal or not is your opinion,' b"and yours alone, don't try to make it seem otherwise." b'if you do not wish to engage in this discussion, use a kill file.' b'if you wish to continue in this discussion, please do so, knowing' b'full well the implications that apply.' b'i know for myself that i plan on continuing with the discussion when' b'i have the wish to have input. i for one am tired of people trying to' b'say that this is not a matter significant for this group! it is, and' b'quite so. especially for those of us who feel the impact more closely.' b'' b'' b'****************************************************************' b'* dominick v. zurlo "if the world\'s an b'* www oyster, why am i b'* eagle scout allergic to mollusks?" b"* blacklisted b'****************************************************************' b'' b''
