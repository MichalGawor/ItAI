b'' b'' b': i would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged' b': couple become "married" in god\'s eyes? some say that if the two have' b': publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to god, and' b': are unswervingly committed to one another (i realize this is a subjective' b": qualifier) they are married/joined in god's sight." b'' b'the way i read scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*' b'married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.' b'' b'some years ago an anglican synod was discussing the marriage canons and' b'there was some debate on what actually constituted a marriage.' b'' b'the bishop of natal, whose wife of many years had died, and who had recently' b'remarried, announced "it must be consummated" and looked like that cat that' b'got the cream.' b'' b'so i suppose he at least would agree with you.' b'' b'============================================================' b'steve hayes, department of missiology editorial department' b'univ. of south africa, p.o. box pretoria, south africa' b'faq: missiology is the study of christian mission and is part of' b'the faculty of theology at unisa'
