b'' b'allthe devil reincarnateswr meter for cb radios' b'' b'tdorganization: cdac, wa' b'tdwhat' b'tdis a good choice for a cb? or wave?' b'td i read the installation instructions on a wave antenna,' b'tdand they suggested that i use an swr to tune it at channel b'tdand channel for a minimum reading. question is, why channel' b'td12 and b'' b'the best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the' b'best explanation, but the rest makes sense) a one wave will cancell itself' b'out (btw no such beastie) the best is a wave antenna, followed by' b'1/4, then etc.' b'' b'as for swring in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct' b'length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. since the' b"wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to swr" b'in using the middle channel of those you are going to use.' b"anyway in the beginning of cb's, all new antennas had to be swr'ed in," b"nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not" b'much point in swring. then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it' b'anyway.' b'' b'cheers' b'peter t.' b''
