b'' b'' b"i've been a giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained" b"about the old ballyard place. sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long," b'and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the giants mystique.' b'or so i thought.' b'' b"i went to tuesday's game giants over the marlins) and the 'stick was" b'a much different place. nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but' b'everything is a lot better. the lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are' b'clean and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.' b'' b'the new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence' b'are very nice, as are the new bleachers. the bleachers start right at the top' b"of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the" b'bottome of the bleachers. the only complaint is that the electronic' b'old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic could be better.' b'' b'these things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real' b'businessman (ex safeway president peter magowan) to figure it out. just' b'like he used to tell his checkers, "if the customers don\'t come back, i don\'t' b'need as many checkers". this isn\'t a knock on bob lurie he was a competent' b"businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public." b'' b"i'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. the onion" b'dispenser jammed as i was using it. an attendant came over, apoligized for' b'the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. after he was done, he cleaned' b'the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. in the old days, there' b'was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say "go to' b'the stand feet away they might be able to help".' b'' b'all in all, it was a fun day' b'' b'' b'--' b'craig eid'
