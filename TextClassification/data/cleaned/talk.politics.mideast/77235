b'' b'' b'' b'|' b'| in the ny times, on sunday, may in an article on somalia, a' b'| reporter writes:' b'| b'| but last year, iran quietly took over four islands belonging' b'| to the united arab emirates and deported their people, with hardly a' b'| protest from the united states. b'| b'| does anyone know what this is referring to? i seem to have missed it.' b'| (spiked, no doubt. b'|' b'| there was something in the nyt and other sources about this for a few' b'| days. it is an ongoing border disupute, and when the iranians kicked' b'| out the uae people it was briefly reported (this was many moons ago).' b"| i don't recall reading of any public us comment; if it were a strong" b'| protest i probably would have seen it.' b'|' b'| those islands would be abu musa, and the greater and lesser tunbs, i presume.' b"| i don't know about a fourth. the latter two islands belong to iran and so" b'|' b'| according to the ny times, the islands "belong[] to the united arab' b'| emirates."' b'' b'| jake livni' b'' b'the ny times is in error. this is not simply my opinion; even the arab sources' b'that i use do not make this claim. this, of course, is assuming that the ny' b'times was refering to the islands that i named above. of those islands, only' b'abu musa has been in dispute and iranian occupation of that island predates' b'the existence of the uae.' b'' b'brad hernlem'
