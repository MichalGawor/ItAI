b'' b'' b' recently, i discovered that it was possible to receive cable' b' tv through the telescopic aerial on the top of my tv.' b' the nearer this aerial is moved to the cable (which i am not' b' connected to) which runs under the eaves of the house the better' b' the signal. now, i was wondering how can i improve the signal?' b' is it possible to improve the signal significantly? (some channels' b'' b' cable egress or emanations if you will are being radiated at free space' b' impedance from cables that may be harmonically realated to certain' b' channels and therfore the standing waves at wave will transfer' b' efficiently. also your antenna (a loose monopole) is also harmonically' b' tuned and will be more efficient at wavelength multiples.' b'' b' your best bet for this research is to use a tuned yagi antenna to get the' b' gain you need. (std tv roof antenna type) the dipoles should be parallel' b" to the radiating cable. a pre-amp doesn't help significantly in my" b' experience in most cases.' b'' b' the inquiring mind bbs, winnipeg, manitoba b'' b'wow, what a concept! does anybody want to speculate on how this' b'"non-connection" would fit into the theft of cable services laws?' b'it seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into' b'the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to' b'stand upon in court.' b'' b'does anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this?' b'' b'jim ritterbusch' b'there is an art, the guide says, or rather a knack to flying. the' b'knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.' b''
