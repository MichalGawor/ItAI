shade, which are words that wordscan plus doesn't think it converted" b'correctly at all. i have found that the software should give itself more' b'credit. it is usually correct, instead of wrong. if a word is shaded blue,' b'you can add it to your personal dictionary. the only problem is the personal' b'dictionary will only handle about words. i find this to be very limited,' b'considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.' b'' b'after a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word' b'processor formats. also any images that were captured can be stored

b'despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would' b'soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain' b'the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in' b'the united states. since the early 1970s, the u.s. public health system has' b'been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,' b'escherichia coli o157:h7, hepatitis c virus, human immunodeficiency virus,' b'legionnaires disease, lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). the incidences' b'of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,' b'malaria, and tuberculosis (tb), have increased in many areas. furthermore,' b'control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug' b'resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,' b'salmonellosis, shigellosis, tb, and staphylococcal infections emerging' b'infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those' b'in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and' b'minority and underserved populations. the substantial economic burden of' b'emerging infections on the u.s. health-care system could be reduced by more' b'effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs' b'(3).' b'this issue of mmwr introduces a new series, "emerging infectious' b'diseases." future articles will address these diseases, as well as' b'surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and' b'public health officials.

more than b'laboratory-confirmed infections with e. coli o157:h7 and four associated' b'deaths occurred in four states washington, idaho, california, and nevada.' b'this report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation that' b'identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from' b'one restaurant chain. washington' b'on january a physician reported to the washington department of' b'health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) and an' b'increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. during january a' b'case-control study comparing of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or' b'postdiarrheal hus identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls' b'implicated eating at chain a restaurants during the week before symptom onset' b'(matched odds ratio or=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). on january' b'18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain a restaurants' b'was initiated.' b'as a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during january-' b'february patients with bloody diarrhea or hus were reported to the' b'state health department. a total of persons had illnesses meeting the case' b'definition of culture-confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection or postdiarrheal hus' b'(figure of the persons, had close contact with a person with' b'confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection during the week preceding onset of' b'symptoms. of the remaining persons, reported eating in a chain a' b'restaurant during the days preceding onset of symptoms. of the patients' b'who recalled what they ate in a chain a restaurant, reported eating' b'a regular-sized hamburger patty. onsets of illness peaked from january b'through january of the casepatients, were hospitalized; b'developed hus, and three died. the median age of patients was years' b'(range: years). idaho' b'following the outbreak report from washington, the division of health,' b'idaho department of health and welfare, identified persons with culture-' b'confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection, with illness onset dates from december' b'11, through february (figure 2a). four persons were' b'hospitalized; one developed hus. during the week preceding illness onset, b'(93%) had eaten at a chain a restaurant. california' b'in late december, the san diego county department of health services was' b'notified of a child with e. coli o157:h7 infection who subsequently died.' b'active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with' b'e. coli o157:h7 infections or hus from mid-november through mid-january b'four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain a restaurant and' b'' b'hicnet medical newsletter page b'volume number april b'' b'four at a chain b restaurant in san diego. after the washington outbreak was' b'reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall b'increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during december and january' b'1993 compared with the same period year earlier. a case was defined as' b'postdiarrheal hus, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,' b'or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded e. coli o157:h7, with' b'onset from november through january b'illnesses of patients met the case definition (figure 2b). the' b'outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. fourteen' b'persons were hospitalized, seven developed hus, and one child died. the median' b'age of case-patients was years (range: years). a case-control study of' b'the first case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community' b'controls implicated eating at a chain a restaurant in san diego (matched' b'or=13; confidence interval ci=1.7-99). a study comparing case-patients' b'who ate at chain a restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-' b'sized hamburger patties (matched or=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).' b'chain b was not statistically associated with illness. nevada' b'on january after receiving a report of a child with hus who had eaten' b'at a local chain a restaurant, the clark county (las vegas) health district' b'issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea' b'contact the health department. a case was defined as postdiarrheal hus, bloody' b'diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness' b'with a stool culture yielding the washington strain of e. coli o157:h7, with' b'onset from december through february because local' b'laboratories were not using sorbitol macconkey (smac) medium to screen stools' b'for e. coli o157:h7, this organism was not identified in any patient. after' b'smac medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of' b'one patient days after illness onset.' b'of persons whose illnesses met the case definition (figure 2c), nine' b'were hospitalized; three developed hus. the median age was years (range:' b'0-83 years). analysis of the first patients identified and age- and sex-' b'matched community controls implicated eating at a chain a restaurant during' b'the week preceding illness onset (matched or=undefined; lower confidence' b'limit=4.9). a case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients' b'also implicated eating hamburgers at chain a (matched or=6.0; ci=0.7-' b'49.8). other investigation findings' b'during the outbreak, chain a restaurants in washington linked with cases' b'primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on november' b'19, some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced on' b'november the outbreak strain of e. coli o157:h7 was isolated from b'lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed' b'to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. approximately b'(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.' b'a meat traceback by a cdc team identified five slaughter plants in the' b'united states and one in canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the' b'' b'hicnet medical newsletter page b'volume number april b'' b'contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing' b'the likelihood of contamination. the animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter' b'plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. no one' b'slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.' b'further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in' b'families and child day care settings is ongoing.' b'' b'reported by: m davis, dvm, c osaki, msph,

gram-negative bacterium first' b'identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody' b'diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since' b'emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus, the most common' b'cause of acute renal failure in children. outbreak investigations have linked' b'most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other' b'food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been' b'implicated preliminary data from a cdc 2-year, nationwide, multicenter' b'study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e. coli o157:h7' b'that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of b'participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools, a' b'higher rate than for any other pathogen.' b'infection with e. coli o157:h7 often is not recognized because most' b'clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on' b'' b'hicnet medical newsletter page b'volume number april b'' b'smac medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses' b'associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea' b'(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. younger age groups' b'and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and' b'complications. illness usually resolves after days, but of patients' b'develop hus, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,' b'renal failure, and a death rate of b'this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community' b'outbreaks of e. coli o157:h7 in the absence of routine surveillance. despite' b'the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in' b'three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington' b'(1). clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from' b'persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e. coli o157:h7 using smac agar b'when infections with e. coli o157:h7 are identified, they should be reported' b'to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public' b'health action to prevent further cases.' b'e. coli o157:h7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can' b'contaminate meat during slaughter. cdc is collaborating with the u.s.' b"department of agriculture's food safety inspection service to identify" b'critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce' b'the likelihood of pathogens such as e. coli o157:h7 entering the meat supply.' b'because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with' b'pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens' b'from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be' b'internally contaminated. the optimal food protection practice is to cook' b'ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices' b'are clear. in this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played' b'an important role. the food and drug administration (fda) has issued interim' b'recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to' b'155 f c) (fda, personal communication, b'regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report' b'and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be' b'consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of' b'outbreaks. the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of' b'this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections' b'caused by e. coli o157:h7 and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e.' b'coli o157:h7.' b'' b'references' b''

b'times in your entire life?" and "do you use snuff now?" similar questions were' b'asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. current users of' b'smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco' b'use at least times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the' b'time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having' b'used snuff or chewing tobacco at least times and not using either at the' b'time of the interview. ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and' b'former users. current smokers were defined
