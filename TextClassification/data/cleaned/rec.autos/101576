b'' b"one of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) probe gt" b'on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the' b'window saying the dealership bought the car back from' b'the previous owner because of "engine noises", but that' b"the ford district rep had ok'ed the car saying those" b'noises were "normal". i thought it was worth looking' b'into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this' b'to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story' b"about her son's probe gt, which had several problems," b'ending with engine noises which she said "was something' b'with the heads", that ford acknowledged the noise, said' b"they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of" b'yet. her son traded the car in (and i checked not' b'the same car). so i have some evidence of a reoccuring' b"problem with the v6 in the probe gt's, and by extension" b'with the madza and mx-6.' b'' b"anything to this? i'd love to consider buying the gt (i'm" b'turning time for my scheduled mid life crisis b"but i'd hate to find out i just became the proud owner" b'of a lemon.'
