b'' b'joachim martillo writes' b'' b'what a dope! there is no value for mohammed elabdellaoui to be here' b'at a western university. third-worldist and islamic brain-rot has' b'made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately.' b'' b'' b'yes, the typical primitive muslim psychopathological psychotic' b'behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact start whining' b'about the jews. what a jerk.' b'' b'you should go back to your mindlessly stupid 3rd world country. your' b'brain has no business in a civilized first world country.' b'' b'joachim carlo santos martillo ajami' b'' b'if you were to substitute the word "jew"/"jewish" in this posting where you' b'see the word "muslim"/"islamic", switch joachim and mohammed\'s names around,' b'and then repost this, you would get a flood of messages attacking the author' b'as an anti-semite. and rightly so. the author of this crap is a racist, pure' b'and simple. he obviously has no qualms about being open with it, either,' b'unlike some other arab- and mulsim-bashers on the net.' b'' b"now, i for one, am not going to look at joachim's posting and infer from it" b'that all jews think this way. sure, there might be some, but this view is not' b"a part of judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all jews' minds are this" b"twisted. however, some muslims might look at joachim's flame as a" b'reaffirmation of their worst fears about jews: that they all hate arabs and' b'are racists.' b'' b'for this reason, i am alarmed that not more jews on the net have spoken out' b'against what joachim has said. they have the chance to possibly change the' b'anti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all jews do' b'*not* hate all arabs and muslims, just like all muslims do *not* hate all' b'jews. yet they are missing that chance. remember, to many people, silence' b'implies consent.' b'' b'peace.' b'--' b'' b'/ nizam arain what makes the universe' b'|| so hard to comprehend'
