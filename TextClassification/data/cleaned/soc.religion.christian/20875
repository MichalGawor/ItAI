b'' b'' b'i would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged' b'couple become "married" in god\'s eyes? some say that if the two have' b'publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to god, and' b'are unswervingly committed to one another (i realize this is a subjective' b"qualifier) they are married/joined in god's sight." b'' b'i have discussed this with my girlfriend often. i consider myself married,' b'though legally i am not. neither of us have been with other people sexually,' b'although we have been with each other. we did not have sexual relations' b'until we decided to marry eventually. for financial and distance reasons,' b'we will not be legally married for another year and a half. until then,' b"i consider myself married for life in god's eyes. i have faith that we" b'have a strong relationship, and have had for over years, and will be' b'full of joy when we marry in a church. first, however, we must find a' b'church( we will be living in a new area when we marry, and will need to' b'find a new church community).' b'' b'anyway, i feel that if two people commit to marriage before god, they are' b'married and are bound by that commitment.' b'' b'--' b'-rick szanto' b'-polk speakers rock\t\t\t\t-computer engineer' b"-mac's suck (nothing personal)\t\t\t-case western" b'-zeta psi rules\t\t\t\t\t-reserve university'
