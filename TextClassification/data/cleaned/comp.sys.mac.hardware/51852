b'' b"i'm currently having trouble connecting my pb to a true blue (ibm model" b'1513) vga monitor. the display is bearly readable but all the details are' b'seperated into yellow and red colors. ie. a window will have two images one' b'in yellow and a ghost image in red. the background is also a little' b'greenish. i read some time ago, before i ever thought i would hook my mac' b'up to a vga screen, about an incompatability with some vga monitors due to' b'the sync on green signal. does this sound like it could be the same demon?' b'i also read that there are both hardware (putting a diode on the green' b"signal?) solution and a software solution to this problem. i don't the" b'details does somebody have them the can e-mail to me or post them? i' b"checked all the faq's for this and didn't find anything about it. did i" b'miss it somewhere? this sure seems that it would be a good thing to have' b'in one. thanks for any replys.' b'' b'charles kuehmann' b'northwestern university' b'steel research group'
