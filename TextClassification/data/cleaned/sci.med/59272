b'' b'' b'from now on it looks like shots per week for' b'6 months followed by shot per month or so. each shot costs' b'$20. talking about soaring costs and the health care system, i would' b'call that a racket. we are not talking about rare amazonian grasses' b"here, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office." b'apart from this issue, i was somewhat disappointed to find out' b'that you have to keep getting the shots forever. is that right?' b'' b'you might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual' b'drops instead of shots for treatment. (you are given a small bottle of' b'antigens; drops are placed under the tongue for minutes.) my' b'allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. throughout the treatment' b"process i had to return to the doctor's office every month for re-testing" b'and a new bottle of antigens. after the allergy was completely neutralized' b'a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about months (the sublingual' b'drops are then taken times per week), and costs so the cost is' b'less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home.' b'' b'bruce long'
