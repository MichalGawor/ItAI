b'' b'' b' if gamma ray bursters are extragalactic, would absorption from the' b' galaxy be expected? how transparent is the galactic core to gamma' b' rays?' b'' b' how much energy does a burster put out? i know energy depends on' b' distance, which is unknown. an answer of the form _x_ ergs per' b' megaparsec^2 is ok.' b'' b'' b' b'i had to turn to one of my problem sets that i did in class for this' b"little problem. i don't have a calculator, but i do have the problem set that" b"we did not too long ago, so i'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted." b'this is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst. bursts are' b'usually more complex than this example i will use here.' b'our burst has a peak flux of 5.43e-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration' b'of seconds. during the frst second of the burst, and the last seconds,' b"its flux is half of the peak flux. it's flux is the peak flux the rest of the" b'time. assume that the background flux is 10e-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.' b'then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several' b'different spheres: r=.25pc(oort cloud radius), r=22.5pc(at the edge of the' b'galaxy), r=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a' b'r=8800mpc.' b'we integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the' b'old standby formula:' b'luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)fpeak' b'for a radius of pc, we found an l around erg/sec. pretty' b'energetic for close by. for the coronal model, we found around erg/sec.' b"and lastly, for the cosmological model an l=10^53. that's what you'd call" b"moderately energetic, i'd say. any suggestions about what could put out that" b'much energy in one second?' b'-jeremy' b'' b'' b''
