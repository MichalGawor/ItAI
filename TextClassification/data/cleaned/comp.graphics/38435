b'' b'' b'a stupid question, but what will cview run on and where can i get it? i' b'am still in need of a gif viewer for linux. (without x-windows.)' b'thanks!' b'' b'' b'ho boy. there is no way in hell you are going to be able to view gifs or do' b'any other graphics in linux without x windows! i love linux because it is' b'so easy to learn.. you want text? okay. use linux. you want text and' b'graphics? use linux with x windows. simple. painless. required to have' b'x windows if you want graphics! this includes fancy word processors like' b'doc, image viewers like xv, etc.' b''
