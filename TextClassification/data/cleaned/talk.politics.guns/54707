b'' b'' b'though i agree this is not the place to discuss guns, i note in passing that' b'a number of gun apologists seem to have ignored the words "well regulated"' b'in their distorted interpretations of the second amendment.' b'' b"what interpretations? just read it as it's written." b'"a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free' b'state, the right of the people, to keep and bear arms, shall not be' b'infringed."' b'' b'where does it say "the right of the people to be members of a militia shall' b'not be infringed" or "the right of the militia to keep and bear arms shall' b'not be infringed?" nowhere.' b'' b'' b'"well-educated businessmen being necessary to the ability of the nation to' b'compete in the international marketplace, the right of the people to attend' b'schools shall not be infringed."' b'' b'would you "interpret" this to mean that only businessmen should have a' b'protected right to attend schools? why or why not?' b'' b'-joe'
