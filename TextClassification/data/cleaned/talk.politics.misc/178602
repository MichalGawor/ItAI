b'' b'' b' any thoughts on who is going to count all of the gorgeous bodies at' b' the mow? the press? the white house staff? the most junior' b' senator? the king of the motss/bi?' b'' b' just curious as to whose bias we are going to see when the numbers' b' get brought out.' b'' b'probably, law enforcement people (park service police and d.c. cops),' b'who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the' b'density of the crowd in small regions.' b'' b'these sort of techniques derive from army intelligence and cia' b'methods of estimating troop strength, and tend to be' b'methodologically skewed to always come up with inflated numbers,' b'so as to justify bigger budgets.' b'' b"judging from past experience (the march, a peace and justice march the" b'same year, and different pro-coice marches), the park service will come out' b'with an estimate that is approximately the estimate that organizers will' b'come up with though the last choice march i went to had a sign-in system,' b"and the numbers ended up closer. and then you've got the media types in their" b'helicopters, rolling dice.' b'' b'i believe the mow plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy, and' b'basing their count on those. i see two problems with this. one, can they' b"get *everybody* to take one (and only one)? two, they couldn't possibly have" b"been able to choose a color/design that won't clash with *somebody's* outfit!" b'' b':-' b'bearpaw' b''
