b'' b'' b'' b'i can remember reading a track competition in some car-magazine, which' b'featured the testarossa, the diablo and the v16t. the result was about' b'the same i would have expected: the cizeta was not only the slowest of' b"the three, but also dropped out halfway during it's test laps because" b'of smoking brakes. for a sportscar it showed ridiculous performance.' b'' b'hm... i find this hard to believe. v16t weights about the same as' b"the red head, but it has hell lot more horse power. perhaps it's" b'due to pre-production glitches? well, to me, it still got the most' b'imposing styling among all the sports cars i have seen.' b'' b'bye...' b'' b'' b'ferrari f40 best sportscar ever built!' b"personally, i don't like cars that rely on turbo power. i guess everyone" b'has their favorite car.' b''
