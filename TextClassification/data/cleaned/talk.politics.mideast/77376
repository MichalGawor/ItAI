b'' b'' b"providing safety and security for one's own people is the most" b'fundamental responsibility of any political entity. for the palestinian' b'leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take the' b'responsibility to protect their people from radical palestinian elements' b'who are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. to argue that a' b'palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful' b'political groups only reinforces the reality that the palestinian' b'leadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical palestinian' b'elements nor effectively deal with the killing of palestinians by' b'palestinians. this is a problem that can only be solved by the' b'palestinian people.'
