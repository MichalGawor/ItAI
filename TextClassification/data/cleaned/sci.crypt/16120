b'' b'1) i think that most of us can afford a stamp and an envelope, and the' b'cost of printing out a letter.' b'' b'2) if some kind soul out there would write a letter, and upload it to' b'the net, everyone could capture it, print it out, and snail-mail it' b'out to their local congressional critter.' b'' b"btw i'm working on one." b'' b'dear senator/congressman/president {fill in the blank}' b'' b"i am writing you to voice my strong opposition to president clinton's clipper" b'chip initiative. this proposal to establish a secret government designed' b'cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice' b'encryption is very disturbing. the idea that citizens must register their' b'secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret' b'is patently unamerican. additionally, the press release for this program' b'strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the' b'clipper chip standard is in place. this latest attack on our civil rights is' b'deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me.' b'' b'the presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the' b'legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this' b'is not the case. the fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment' b'is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press' b'release will simply use non clipper cryptography. meanwhile the average citizen' b'may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the' b'government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number' b'which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. this seems like an' b'obvious back door for the nsa and law enforcement. if you still do nott' b'understand my objection to key registration, consider the way j. edgar hoover' b'blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to' b'transmit personal details of your life that the nsa and fbi have the keys to?' b'' b'' b'______________________________________________________________________________' b'well heres a letter, i didnt spell check it since i dont know how in emacs' b'so you might want to do that.' b'' b'bill smythe'
