b'' b'hi there,' b"i'm having a bizarre video problem within windows i have a with" b"a gvga-16 video board. i've been using the standard windows vga driver" b'with other similarly configured computers.' b'' b"i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes it's screen." b'' b'the problem is that once windows has been envoked, the colors start' b'changing themselves. at first i thought it was hardware, but if you open' b"a full screen dos program from within the windows session, you don't have" b'any problems until you get back to windows however, when you initially' b'return to windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.' b'' b'also, it is not a uniform color change so if you are in solitaire, the' b"design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but" b'the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.' b'' b'the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark' b'purple-ish black. if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows the' b'screen gets refreshed again.' b'' b"if i don't log into windows and just do dos things from the novell" b'network, everything is fine.' b'' b'i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the' b'other machine i had just finished configuring, then from the net to this' b'machine. when i ran into problems, i deleted everything on this machine' b"and the net, and tried bouncing it again. when that didn't work, i tried" b'reloading windows to no avail.' b'' b'any thoughts on things to check out? i am totally baffled!' b'' b'thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!' b'' b'linda cornell' b'uw office of research'
