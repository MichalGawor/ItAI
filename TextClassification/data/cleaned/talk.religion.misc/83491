b'' b' this brings up another question i still have to ponder: why is there so' b" much anti-semitism? why do people hate jews? i don't hate jews. i consider" b' them to be like anyone else, sinners we all are.' b"i don't know, i don't care about ethnical rights and wrongs myself," b"but it's evident that christians consider jews no longer to be the" b"sole selected group of god's people while jews consider this to" b'be the case.' b'' b'christian anti-semitism comes from the obvious fact that the jews should' b'know the hebrew scriptures better than anyone else, yet they did not' b'convert to christianity en mass, thus rejecting "christian love."' b'' b'no wonder this caused anti-semitism. one might even' b"wonder that if christianity didn't do this separation, would anti-semitism" b'have even started?' b'' b"i don't see why not. where are the rest of the tribal people? what" b'happened to the tribes of the americas? culture is seen as different and' b'undesirable in the west, particular in the us with its failed "melting' b'pot concept." most tribes have been hunted to extinction, the hebrew' b'tribe is one of the few survivers from the neolithic. of course it' b'becomes difficult at times to separate christianity from the western' b'experience, so perhaps you are right, perhaps it would have been a better' b'world if the cultural experiment in christianity never happened.'
