b'' b"amongst penguins' fans there seems to be an inner calm that i've never" b'experienced before this year with the pens. the players and the fans have so' b"much confidence in the team this year. we're savoring every game and saving" b'our energy for the stanley cup.' b'' b"that's not inner calm. it's boredom, and it's being spoiled. the arena's" b'been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just' b"take winning for granted. it's been seemingly forever since the team" b"lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and" b'surprise at victory.' b'' b"while i'm glad to have the pens doing so well, in some ways it was a better" b'high back when the pens beat the bruins two years ago, and the rangers last' b'year. too much of a good thing is not always good for you.' b'' b'rick' b''
