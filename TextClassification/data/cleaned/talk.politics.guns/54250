b'' b'' b' look, if you can figure out a reliable means of keeping guns away from' b" bad people, while not interfering with good people, i think we'd all be" b" for it. the problem is, the methods we're using now don't do the trick." b'' b" don't manufacture them. don't sell them. don't import them." b'' b' some guns will get through, but far fewer, and far less people will' b' die because of them. hunting weapons could be allowed, of course, as' b' long as they are big, and bulky, and require reloading after a few' b' shots (how many times can you shoot at the same animal, anyways one' b' assumes they are moving!)' b'' b'a better solution:' b'' b"if the 'bad' people can't be trusted with guns, then lock them or knock" b'them off. stop punishing good people.'
