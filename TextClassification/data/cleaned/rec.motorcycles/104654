b'' b'' b'after reading the service manual for my bike (suzuki gs500e--1990) i have' b'a couple of questions i hope you can answer:' b'' b'when checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill' b'cap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not? i am more used to' b'the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean' b'and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read. the dip stick on my bike' b'is part of the oil filler cap and has about inch of threads on it. do' b'i remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without' b'screwing it down before reading?' b'' b'the service manual calls for the application of suzuki bond no. 1207b on' b'the head cover. i guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material. do' b'you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?' b'' b'my headlight is a halogen w bulb. is there an easy, brighter' b'replacement bulb available? where should i look for one?' b'' b'as always, i very much appreciate your help. the weather in philadelphia' b'has finally turned warm. this weekend i saw lotsa bikes, and the riders' b'all waved. a nice change of tone from what philadelphia can be like. b'' b'chris' b'' b'--' b'*******************************************************************' b'christopher g. karras'
