b'' b' i must have missed the postings about waco, david koresh, and the second' b' coming. how does one tell if a second coming is the real thing, unless the' b' person claiming to be it is obviously insane?' b'' b'one rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are' b'wrong. i was just reading john this morning (i think that is the' b"right chapter, anyway it is close and i don't have a bible at work to" b'check with.) and in it jesus is talking to his disciples about his' b'impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later' b'he will be with them. he said something along the lines of "i will' b'be in you and you will be in me." (again i cannot provide the exact' b'quote or citation.) anyway, my understanding of this is that' b'the second coming will not be an outward event. it is an inward' b'event, christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.' b'if you look for a person you will be deceived.' b'' b'it seems to me that the jews had been looking for a messiah that would' b"be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize jesus when" b'he came. jesus tried to show that his kingdom was not of this earth.' b'a lot of what i have seen written about the second coming seems to' b'based on an expectation of christ coming back and finally taking over' b'the world and running it the way it should be. it sounds a lot like' b"what the jews were looking for. the first coming wasn't like that and" b'i see no reason for the second coming to be like that either.' b'' b"oh and by the way, i don't expect it to happen once. there is no one" b'second coming, there are a lot of little ones. every time christ' b'comes into someones heart, christ has come again.' b'' b'peace,' b'will.' b'' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'| westboro, mass. change without notice. b'|---------------------------------------------------------------------------' b"| when all your dreams are laid to rest, you can get what's second best, b"|\tbut it's hard to get enough.\t\tdavid wilcox b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
