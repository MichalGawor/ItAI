b'' b'you know, it just occurred to me today that this whole christian thing' b'can be blamed solely on mary.' b'' b"so, she's married to joseph. she gets knocked up. what do you think" b"ol' joe will do if he finds she's been getting around? so mary comes up" b'with this ridiculous story about god making her pregnant. actually, it' b"can't be all that ridiculous, considering the number of people that" b'believe it. anyway, she never tells anyone the truth, and even tells' b"poor little jesus that he's hot shit, the son of god. everyone else" b"tells him this too, since they've bought mary's story. so, what does" b'mary actually turn out to be? an adultress and a liar, and the cause of' b"mankind's greatest folly..." b'' b'just my recently-minted two cents.' b'' b'chris' b'' b'----------------------' b'chris leger' b'sophomore, carnegie mellon computer engineering' b"remember...if you don't like what somebody is saying, you can always" b'ignore them!' b''
