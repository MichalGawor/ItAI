b'' b'' b'now, as to the suggestion that all prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical,' b"can you elaborate? i'm not exactly sure what you mean. how does the" b"suggestion relate to isaiah's prophecy of the birth of christ by a virgin?" b"i don't see any cycles in that prophecy." b'' b'maybe cyclical is not the best word. that is one aspect of it. in the' b'case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and' b'also prophetically to christ. the army that threatened the king would' b'cease to be a threat in a very short time. yet it also prophecied of' b'christ.' b'' b'several prophecies that refered to christ also had application at the' b'time they were made. "out of egypt have i called my son" refers both' b'to israel, and prophetically to christ. "why do the heathen rage"' b'was said of david and also of christ.' b'' b'another example would be the scripture quoted of judas, "and his bishoprick' b'let another take." another example is something that isaiah said of his' b'disciples which is also applied to christ in hebrews, "the children thou' b'hast given me."' b'' b'how does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.' b'' b'link' b'' b'' b'link hudson.'
