b'' b']i was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in milford nh with an assortment' b']of other nedod folks when dean cookson yes he has not left the' b']country, yet) mentioned that the wiring diagram of the vfr750' b']shows that the light switch is a three position switch.' b'' b']high beam' b']low beam' b']both beams' b'' b']well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a' b']2 position switch, but sure enough as deam expected when' b']you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high' b']and low beams go on.' b'' b']this provides a very nice light coverage of the road.' b'' b']this is true for the st11 and the vfr750 and i would expect for any' b']other late model honda with the standard two position light switch.' b'' b"]thanks to dean for reading the schematics, try it you'll like it." b'' b'be a bit careful doing this; i used to balance the switch on my gs550b' b"avec cibie' h4 insert so that both beams were on. i eventually fried the" b"main ignition switch, as it wasn't designed to pass that sort of current." b'' b'gsx600f, rg250wd.\tsi=2.66 "you porsche. me pass!"\tdod
