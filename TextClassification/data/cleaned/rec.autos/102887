b'' b" i have had two wranglers, and still have the second right now. it's a" b' wrangler base model with the big i-6 4.0l engine, hard top, no' b' power steering or air conditioning. runs like a top. has about 37k on' b' it. has never been in the shop. i can change my own oil (nice tall' b' vehicle). i can lube it myself fittings). i occasionally take it to' b' jiffy lube to check the differentials and do the oil change there.' b'' b" my previous wrangler had nary a problem either. here in colorado there'" b" more jeeps than bmw's, mercedes, volvos, and the like together! in fact" b' jeep has been called the colorado car for a while. they hold their value' b' well, and are very easy to resell. mine cost right around $14.2k new. of' b" course, i didn't blow money on an islander, sahara, or renegade which" b'^^^^^^^^^^' b'i have a wrangler sahara and paid new (including the rebate).' b'' b' are just wranglers with fancy inside stuff.' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'after driving a cj-5 for years, that fancy stuff is pretty nice.' b'' b'' b' the cars are primitive, ride like a dump truck, etc.. but if you live in' b' an area that gets around of snow per winter, you\'d have one too.' b" they'll go anywhere (with a winch) and are easy to get parts for. the" b'^^^^^^^^^^^' b"i like my wrangler, but when doing some serious off roading, it can't" b'keep up with a cj-5 because of ground clearance and limited suspension' b'travel. i do have a winch and would like to get an arb air-locker in the' b'future.' b'' b' 4.0l engine puts out hp and gets around 20mpg. not bad.' b'' b'i love the b'' b'' b" just my experience. i'm sure there are bad ones out there, but that goes" b' for any make and model.' b'' b'' b'' b'don graham' b'' b'' b''
