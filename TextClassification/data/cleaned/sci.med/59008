b'' b'' b'my year son is so plagued. lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems' b"to keep it under control. but let him get bopped there, and he'll recur for" b'days! also allergies, colds, dry air all seem to contribute. but again, the' b'vaseline, or a&d ointment, or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring.' b'' b'if you can get it, you might want to try a canadian over-the-counter product' b'called secaris, which is a water-soluble gel. compared to vaseline or other' b"greasy ointments, secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's" b'already there.' b'' b'--' b':- michael a. covington, associate research scientist b':- the university of georgia phone b':- athens, georgia u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi
