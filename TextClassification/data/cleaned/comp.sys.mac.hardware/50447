b'' b'well, here are the results of the mathematica test which i posted to' b'this newsgroup. the "test" was the following command:' b'' b'plot3d[((-2*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-5000)^2+(y-8000)^2+' b'81000000)^1.5))+((-3*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-10000)^2+' b'(y-1000)^2+81000000)^1.5))+((4*2000)/(2*3.1416*' b'((x-7000)^2+(y-10000)^2+4000000)^1.5)),' b'{x,-5500,19500},{y,-5500,19500},plotpoints-50]' b'' b'' b'i was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on' b'various macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and' b'workstations. the results are posted below:' b'' b'machine\t\tsystem\t\tmath vers.\t# of trials\ttime, min' b'' b'pb 170\t\t7.0.0 with\t2.1\t\t2\t\t2:08' b'tuneup/8mb' b'ram/5mb for' b'mathematica' b'' b'dec 5000\tultrix v4.2a\t2.1 for\t\t1\t\t0:25' b'dec risc' b'' b'25mhz/5mb ram/' b'3mb for math./' b'w/ b'' b'c650\t\t7.1/8mb ram\t\t\t2\t\t0:32' b'' b'4mb for math.' b'' b'sparc\t\tsunos4.1.3\t\t\t\t\t0:14' b'station\t\t40mb ram' b'' b'sgi iris/4d\tr3000 risc\t\t\t\t\t<0:01' b'processor' b'version' b'' b'sparc\t\tsunos4.1.2\t2.1 \t\t\t\t0:26' b'station2' b'' b'iisi\t\t7.1\t\t\t\t\t\t3:15' b'' b'next\t\tnextstep 2.1\t1.2\t\t\t\t2:38' b'cube\t\t68030 based/' b'w/ coprocessor' b'' b'next\t\tnextstep 3.0\t1.2\t\t5(ave)\t\t0:52' b'cube\t\t68040/25mhz/' b'20 mb ram' b'' b'iisi\t\t17mb/8mb for\t2.102 enha\t\t\t3:15' b'math.' b'w/ b'' b'next\t\t16mb ram/\t\t\t1 \t\t0:37' b'25 mhz b'workspace' b'manager b'' b'funny how the iisi running at mhz is slower than other equivalent' b'machines, lots slower in fact. perhaps the version of mathematica' b'makes a difference or the fact that not much ram was allocated.' b'another interesting thing is how fast the sgi did it. wow.' b'' b"basically, though, i wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data. it" b"seems that mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables. i" b'was just curious how different machines would measure up.' b'' b'well, if you have any questions or if i forgot something, just drop me' b'' b'chad' b'' b"ps if the spacing of the above table doesn't come out right on your" b"machine, tell me and i'll mail you a copy of this in a binhexed word" b'5.1 document.' b'' b'' b'' b''
