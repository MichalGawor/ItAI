you wanna know my three stars of the season? well, since you asked...' b'' b'#1 eric lindros. eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.' b"the difference between the team's record with him and without him is no" b'accident. i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without' b'recchi. there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric' b"lindros on it, and i think that he will deservedly wear the 'c' on his jersey" b'next season.' b'' b'#2 tommy soderstrom. shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour,' b"and tommy didn't have a chris chelios (booo) in front of him. he also didn't" b'play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family' b"has a history of heart problems). there's no question in my mind that tommy" b'soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if roussel complains again' b'about being number look for him to be traded within years.' b'' b"#3 mark recchi. again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season" b"scoring mark. there are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player" b'get as many points. plus, mark is the only flyer to play the entire season.' b'not a tough choice.' b'' b"honorable mentions: rod brind'amour topped his single season high point total" b"which he set last year. the difference was that he wasn't on the top line" b"this year and didn't get as much playing time. then again, he didn't get the" b'defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.' b'' b'dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. yes, he made rookie' b'mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. i have a feeling' b"that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up" b"anything in his own zone, and i suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman" b'in years to come.' b'' b"garry galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. again, there are some" b"things you just can't argue with. and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome," b'he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his' b'wishes under doctors orders. but his defensive play often negates his offensive' b'contribution. a little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end' b'will make him a much more important part of the team next year.' b'' b'brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.' b'but consistency became a problem for him.' b'' b'a couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:' b'' b'tom misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange e-mail' b'addresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.' b"if you're interested, you can send him mail at:" b'' b'att!acr.org!tmisnik' b'' b'the flyers end the season game below in 5th place, their best winning' b'percentage since going in within the division (4th in' b'patrick), at home. they finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in' b'next years entry draft (quebec had the 1st rounder, though). they scored as' b'many goals as they allowed, b'' b'the straight wins is the most since they won in a row in b'' b'i will be sending out final stats as soon as i get the issue of the hockey' b'news that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to i have' b'no other way of getting them.' b'' b"i hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as i have. knowing" b'the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time' b'almost bearable.' b'' b'flyers team record watch:' b'' b'eric lindros:' b'' b'41 goals, assists, points' b'' b'(rookie records)' b'club record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:' b'eric lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tdave poulin\t76 b'brian propp\t34 1979-80\t\tbrian propp\t75 b'ron flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\teric lindros\t75 b'dave poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tron flockhart\t72 b'bill barber\t30 1972-73\t\tpelle eklund\t66 b'' b'mark recchi:' b'' b'53 goals, assists, points.' b'' b'club record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:' b'reggie leach\t61 1975-76\t\tmark recchi\t123 b'tim kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tbobby clarke\t119 b'tim kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tbobby clarke\t116 b'mark recchi\t53 1992-93*\t\tbill barber\t112 b'rick macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tbobby clarke\t104 b'bill barber\t50 1975-76\t\trick macliesh\t100 b'reggie leach\t50 b'' b'*more than games.' b'' b'flyers career years:' b'' b'player\t\tpoints\tbest prior season' b'mark recchi\t123\t113 penguins)' b"rod brind'amour\t86\t77 flyers)" b'garry galley\t62\t38 kings)' b'brent fedyk\t59\t35 red wings)' b'' b"that's all for now..." b'' b'pete clark jr rsh flyers contact and mailing list owner' b''
