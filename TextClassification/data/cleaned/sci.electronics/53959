b'' b'my main question is the bulb: where can i get uv bulbs? do they' b'need a lot of power? etc., etc.' b'' b"i've seen them in surplus stores. all they are are fluorescent bulbs" b"without the phosphor, and a uv transparent bulb (special glass). i've" b'also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120vac' b'socket, probably not what you want.' b'' b'' b"i'm not too concerned with whether it's long-wave or short-wave" b"(but hey, if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs, i'll take both)." b'' b'one other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-uv' b'light being cheaper to get at than actual uv light. does anyone' b'know what he was referring to?' b'' b'as far as i know, near uv (as opposed to far-uv) is longwave uv (near' b'the visible spectrum). longwave uv is safer as far as accidental (i hope)' b'exposure to the eyes. as far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a' b'friend has a uv lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long uv.' b'' b'hope this helps.' b'' b'dave.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'thanks much.' b'' b'' b'--' b'john hawkinson' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'| who i am: david malecki b'| b'----------------------------------------------------------------------'
