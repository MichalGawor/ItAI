b'' b"i have a buick skylark with 148k on it. i bought it in california, and if" b"it'll let me, i'd like to keep it for another year. the only problem is these" b"indiana winters--my heater controls don't work." b'' b'the car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents. right now it is' b'stuck in the "vent" mode. it will blow warm air, but i can\'t switch the air' b"flow to either the floor (i can live without this) or the defrost (i can't" b'live without this). i probably could just jam the air deflector to the' b'defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,' b'kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.' b'' b'i have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and i think' b'the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down' b'and outside/inside air flow. the diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-' b'side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is' b'probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.' b'' b'two questions:' b'' b'1) is there anything i should be aware of about this (other than' b'the fact that i should move from indiana) b'' b"2) in the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there" b'a way to "fix" this?' b'' b'thanks for any advice/info' b'' b'selah,' b'' b'dan'
