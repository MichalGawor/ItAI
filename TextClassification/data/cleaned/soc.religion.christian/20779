b'' b'date: mar gmt' b'i am looking for any information on the branch davidians. send info to chad' b'litton, acs dept. bgsu, bowling green oh or e-mail to' b'' b"i don't claim to be an expert on the branch davidians, but i might know more" b'than most.' b'' b'the branch davidian group (led by koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots' b"of a group known as the shephard's rod. the shephard's rod (now" b"defunct as far as i know)broke off from the sda church in the 30's." b'' b"the shephard's rod broke away from the sda church because they felt that the" b'sda church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy. they felt that they' b'were the remnant spoken about in revelation.' b'' b'about the koresh group, koresh gained control of it in or once' b'in control, he made himself the center of it. he proclaimed himself as' b'christ.' b'' b'koresh himself came from an sda background. he was excommunicated as a young' b'adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over' b'the youth in the church. after this, he joined the branch davidians.' b'' b'they were/are a survivalist cult. this is why they had the stockpile of' b'weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc. they had no intent of raiding the us' b'government or anything. they were preparing for armaggedon and were' b'putting themselves in a self defense position.' b'' b"in my opinion, if the atf and the fbi had left well enough alone, we wouldn'" b't have the blood of children crying out from the ashes in waco.' b'' b"if you want to know about the shephard's rod, you might want to visit the" b'local sda church and talk to some of the older people. they could give you' b'some insight into where koresh got his theology.' b'' b'tammy'
