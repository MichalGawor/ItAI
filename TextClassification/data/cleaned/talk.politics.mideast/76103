"don\'t fear," he said, "it\'s nothing, nothing all that' b'bad." he didn\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. and just then on television they' b'broadcast that two azerbaijanis had been killed in karabakh, near askeran.' b"when i heard that i couldn't settle down at all, i kept walking here and" b'there and i said, "they\'re going to kill us, the azerbaijanis are going to' b'kill us." and he says, "don\'t be afraid." then we heard--from the central' b"square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting" b'different things, and you couldn\'t hear every well. i say, "you speak' b'azerbaijani well, listen to what they\'re saying." he says "close the window' b'and go to bed, there s nothing happening there." he listened a bit and then' b'closed the window and went to bed, and told us, "come on, go to sleep, it\'s' b'nothing." sleep, what did he mean sleep? my son and i stood at the window' b"until two in the morning watching. well he's sick, and all of this was" b'affecting him. i say, "igor, you go to bed, i\'m going to go to bed in a minute' b'too." he went and i sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.' b'things had calmed down slightly.' b'' b'the 28th, sunday, was my day off. my husband got up and said, "come on, emma,' b'get up." i say, "today\'s my day off, let me rest." he says, "aren\'t you going' b'to make me some tea?" well i felt startled and got up, and said, "where are' b'you going?" he says, "i\'m going out, i have to." i say, "can you really go' b"outside on a day like today? don't go out, for god's sake. you never listen to" b"me, i know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take" b'the car out of the garage, go without the car." and he says, "come on, close' b'the door!" and then on the staircase he muttered something, i couldn\'t make it' b'out, he probably said "coward" or something.' b'' b'i closed the door and he left. and i started cleaning picking things up' b"around the house everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-" b'noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. i said,' b'"khalida, was it our car?" she says, "no, no, emma, don\'t be afraid, they' b"were government cars and zhigulis.'' our car is a gaz-21 volga. and i waited," b"it was four o'clock, five o'clock and when he wasn't home at seven i" b'said, "oh, they\'ve killed shagen!"' b'' b"tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and i'm afraid, i'm" b"standing on the balcony and i'm all my whole body is shaking. my god," b"they've probably killed him! so basically i waited like that until ten" b"o'clock and he still hadn't come home. and i'm afraid to go out. at ten" b"o'clock i look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore," b'and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.' b"i'm looking out of one window and igor is looking out of the other, and i" b"don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see" b'it. we wanted to hide it from one another. i joined him. "mamma," he says,' b'"look what they\'re doing over there!" they were burning everything, and there' b'were police standing there, or of them, maybe twenty policemen standing' b'on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are' b'throwing everything down from the balcony. and one of the ones on the balcony' b'is shouting, "what are you standing there for, burn it!" when they threw the' b'television, wow, it was like a bomb! our neighbor on the third floor came out' b'on her balcony and shouted, "why are you doing that, why are you burning those' b'things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their' b'home. why are you burning them?" and from the courtyard they yell at her, "go' b"inside, go inside! instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in" b'your building or not?" they meant armenians, but they didn\'t say armenians,' b'they said, "of them." she says, "no, no, no, none!" then she ran downstairs to' b'our place, and says, "emma, emma, you have to leave!" i say, "they\'ve killed' b"shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? it won't be living for me without" b'shagen. let them kill us, too!" she insists, saying, "emma, get out of here,' b"go to khalida's, and give me the key. when they come i'll say that it's my" b'daughter\'s apartment, that they\'re off visiting someone." i gave her the key' b'and went to the neighbor\'s, but i couldn\'t endure it. i say, "igor, you stay' b'here, i\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe papa\'s papa\'s there."' b'' b'meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, alik and valery [albert and' b'valery avanesians; see the accounts of rima avanesian and alvina baluian], in' b"the courtyard. there is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling," b"and i didn't think that they were killing at the time. alik and valery lived" b'in the corner house across from ours. when i went out into the courtyard i saw' b'an azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about years old. i say, "madar,' b"uncle shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the" b'garage, let\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. "he shouts, "aunt' b"emma, where do you think you're going?! go back into the house, i'll look for" b'him." i say, "something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, madar,' b'i\'m coming too." well he wouldn\'t let me go all the same, he says, "you stay' b'here with us, i\'m go look." he went and looked, and came back and said, "aunt' b'emma, there\'s no one there, the garage is closed. "madar went off again and' b'then returned and said, "aunt emma, they\'re already killed alik, and valery\'s' b'there wheezing."' b'' b'madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, "don\'t go near him,' b'or we\'ll put you next to him." he got scared--he\'s young--and came back and' b'said, "i\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take' b'alik, maybe he\'ll live they grew up together in our courtyard, they' b'knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. he went to call, but' b'not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. he called, and' b'called, and called, and called--nothing.' b'' b'i went upstairs to the neighbor\'s. igor says, "two police cars drove up over' b"there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still" b'lying where they were, they\'re still lying there "we watched out the' b"window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. i didn't" b'take my clothes off. i lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six' b'o\'clock in the morning i got up and said, "igor, you stay here at home, don\'t' b"go out, don't go anywhere, i'm going to look, i have to find papa, dead or" b'alive let me go i\'ve got the keys from work."' b'' b"at six o'clock i went to the emergency hospital. the head doctor and another" b'doctor opened the door to the morgue. i run up to them and say, "doctor, is' b'shagen there?" he says, "what do you mean? why should shagen be here?!" i' b"wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. there were only four people in there," b"they said. well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. they" b'said, "shagen\'s not here, he\'s alive somewhere, he\'ll come back."' b'' b"it's already seven o'clock in the morning. i look and there is a panel truck" b'with three policemen. some of our people from the hospital were there with' b'them. i say, "sara baji ["sister" sara, term of endearment], go look, they\'ve' b'probably brought shagen." i said it, shouted it, and she went and came back' b'and says, "no, emma, he has tan shoes on, it\'s a younger person." now shagen' b'just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. when they' b'said it like that i guessed immediately. i went and said, "doctor, they\'ve' b'brought shagen in dead." he says, "why are you carrying on like that, dead,' b'dead he\'s alive." but then he went all the same, and when he came back' b'the look on his face was i could tell immediately that he was dead. they' b'knew one another well, shagen had worked for him a long time. i say, "doctor,' b'is it shagen?" he says, "no, emma, it\'s not he, it\'s somebody else entirely."' b'i say, "doctor, why are you deceiving me, i\'ll find out all the same anyway,' b'if not today, then tomorrow." and he said i screamed, right there in the' b'office. he says, "emma, go, go calm down a little." another one of our' b'colleagues said that the doctor had said it was shagen, but in hideous' b"condition. they tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't shagen. a few minutes" b'later another colleague comes in and says, "oh, poor emma!" when she said it' b'like that there was no hope left.' b'' b'that day was awful. they were endlessly bringing in dead and injured' b'people.' b'' b'at night someone took me home. i said, "igor, papa\'s been killed."' b'' b'on the morning of the 1st i left igor at home again and went to the hospital:' b'i had to bury him somehow, do something. i look and see that the hospital is' b'surrounded by soldiers. they are wearing dark clothes. "hey, citizen, where' b'are you going?" i say, "i work here," and from inside someone shouts, "yes,' b'yes, that\'s our cook, let her in." i went right to the head doctor\'s office' b'and there is a person from the city health department there, he used to' b'work with us at the hospital. he says, "emma, shagen\'s been taken to baku.' b'in the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to baku." i' b'say, "doctor, how will i bury him?" he says, "we\'re taking care of all that,' b"don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. where did you" b'spend the night?" i say, "i was at home." he says, "what do you mean you' b'were at home?! you were at home alone?" i say, "no, igor was there too." he' b'says, "you can\'t stay home, we\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just' b"one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right" b'now, you put on a lab coat and take one for igor, you go and bring igor here' b'like a patient, and you\'ll stay here and we\'ll se~ later what to do next b"his last name is kagramanov. the head doctor's name is izyat jamalogli" b'sadukhov.' b'' b'the "ambulance" arrived and i went home and got igor. they admitted him as a' b'patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. we stayed in the' b'hospital until the 4th.' b'' b'some police car came and they said, "emma, let\'s go." and the women, our' b'colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, "where are' b'you taking her?" i say, "they\'re going to kill me, too and the' b'investigator says, "why are you saying that, we\'re going to make a positive' b'identification." we went to baku and they took me into the morgue i' b'still can\'t remember what hospital it was the investigator says, "let\'s' b'go, we need to be certain, maybe it\'s not shagen." and when i saw the caskets,' b'lying on top of one another, i went out of my mind. i say, "i can\'t look, no."' b'the investigator says, "are there any identifying marks?" i say, "let me see' b'the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, i\'ll recognize them." he says,' b'"isn\'t they\'re anything on his body?" i say he has seven gold teeth and his' b'finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. shagen was a carpenter, he had' b'been injured at work b'' b'they brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they' b'brought them and they were all burned when i saw them i shouted, "oh,' b'they burned him!" i shouted, i don\'t know, i fell down or maybe i sat' b'down, i don\'t remember. and that investigator says, "well fine, fine, since' b"we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth since" b'he has seven gold teeth b'' b'on the 4th they told me: "emma, it\'s time to bury shagen now." i cried, "how,' b"how can i bury shagen when i have only one son and he's sick? i should inform" b'his relatives, he has three sisters, i can\'t do it by myself." they say, "ok,' b'you know the situation. how will they get here from karabagh? how will they' b'get here from yerevan? there\'s no transportation, it s impossible."' b'' b'he was killed on february and i buried him on march we buried him in' b'sumgait. they asked me, "where do you want to bury him?" i said, "i want to' b'bury him in karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in karabagh," i\'m' b'shouting, and the head of the burial office, i guess, says, "do you know what' b'it means, take him to karabagh?! it means arson!" i say, "what do you mean,' b"arson? don't they know what's going on in karabagh? the whole world knows that" b"they killed them, and i want to take him to karabagh, i don't have anyone" b'anymore." i begged, i pleaded, i grieved, i even got down on my knees. he' b'says, "let\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,' b'if it calms down, i\'ll help you move him to karabagh b'' b'our trial was the first in sumgait. it was concluded on may at the' b'investigation the murderer, tale ismailov, told how it all happened, but then' b'at the trial he tried to wriggle he tried to soften his crime.' b'then they brought a videotape recorder, i guess, and played it, and said,' b'"ismailov, look, is that you?" he says, "yes." "well look, here you\'re' b'describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?" he says,' b'"yes." "and now you\'re telling it differently?" he says, "well maybe i' b'forgot!" like that.' b'' b'the witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going' b'along mir street, there was a crowd of about people shagen had a' b'volga gaz-21. the people surrounded his car, and all of them were' b"involved. one of them was this ismailov guy, this tale. they--it's unclear" b'who--started pulling shagen out of the car. well, one says from the left side' b'of the car, another says from the right side. they pulled off his sports' b'jacket. he had a jacket on. well they ask him, "what\'s your nationality?" he' b'says, "armenian." well they say from the crowd they shouted, "if he\'s an' b'armenian, kill him, kill him!" they started beating him, they broke seven of' b"his ribs, and his heart i don't know, they did something there, too" b". it's too awful to tell about. anyway, they say this tale guy he" b'had an armature shaft. he says, "i picked it up, it was lying near a bush,' b'that\'s where i got it." he said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he' b'had already had it. he said, "i hit him twice," he said, once or twice' b'on the head with that rod." and he said that when he started to beat him' b'shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. he said,' b'"i left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,' b'killing someone," he says, "and i came back to look, is that shagen alive or' b'not?" i said, "you wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you' b'came back to hit him again?" he went back and looked and he was already dead.' b'"after that," that bastard tale said, "after that i went home."' b'' b'i said, "you you little snake," i said, "are you a thief and a' b'murderer?" shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. they' b"were taken. he says he didn't take them" b'' b'when they overturned and burned the car, that tale was no longer there, it was' b'other people who did that. who it was, who turned over the car and who burned' b'it, that hasn\'t been clarified as yet. i told the investigator, "how can you' b'have the trial when you don\'t know who burned the car?" he said something, but' b'i didn\'t get what he was saying. but i said, "you still haven\'t straightened' b'everything out, i think that\'s unjust."' b'' b'when they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.' b'in the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over b'percent of his body b'' b'and i ask again, why was he killed? my husband was a carpenter; he was a good' b'craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his' b'own hands. we have three children. three sons. only igor was with me at the' b'time. the older one was in pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the' b"army. and now they're fatherless..." b'' b"i couldn't sit all the way through it. when the procurator read up to b"years' deprivation of freedom, i just i went out of my mind, i didn't" b'know what to do with myself, i said, "how can that be? you," i said, "you are' b"saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is years'" b'deprivation of freedom?" i screamed, i had my mind! i said, "let me at that' b'creep, with my bare hands i\'ll a relative restrained me, and there' b'were all those military people there i lest. i said," this isn\'t a' b'soviet trial, this is unjust!" that\'s what i shouted, l said it and left b'' b'i said that on february when those people were streaming down our street,' b'they were shouting, "long live turkey!" and "glory to turkey!" and during the' b'trial i said to that ismailov, "what does that mean, \'glory to turkey\'?" i' b"still don't understand what turkey has to do with this, we live in the soviet" b'union. that turkey told you to or is going to help you kill armenians? i still' b'don\'t understand why "glory to turkey!" i asked that question twice and got no' b'answer no one answered me b'' b'may b'yerevan' b'' b'- reference b'' b'[1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan,' b'volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by' b'yelena bonner, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages b'' b'' b'--' b"s.d.p.a. center for regional studies the armenian border, when we can't" b'p.o. box even explain b'cambridge, ma turkish mp, march
