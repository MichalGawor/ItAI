b'' b'i appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query. one reply, which' b'i have lost, suggested several parishes in new york that have good masses, one' b"of which was corpus christi in downtown manhattan. by coincidence, last week's" b'_america_, the national jesuit magazine, carried an interview with fr. myles' b"bourke, corpus christi's pastor emeritus. fr. bourke also directed the nt" b'translation in the new american bible. he noted "...certain practices have' b'been introduced into the mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,' b'and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy." i note that at my' b"parents' parish on easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the" b'offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word "risen". this was not a' b'kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended mass.' b'' b'i wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies. this newsgroup as a' b"whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation" b'on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself).' b'sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is' b'the exception, i think. benefits of the doubt are generally granted. it seems' b'so...christian?' b'' b'john murray'
