b'' b'' b" i'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need direct" b' input boxes for the keyboards. these are the little boxes that take a' b' line level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-z for the run' b" to the mixer. sadly they cost like (or more) each and i'm going" b' to need like or of them! i looked inside one (belonging to' b' another band) and it looks like just a transformer. does anyone have' b' any plans for building them? perhaps in anderton\'s "electronic' b' projects for musicians" book (which i am having a hell of a time' b' tracking down...)?' b'' b'an easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the' b'balanced low-z output, but this solution does not provide any' b'galvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and' b'mixer. if no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap,' b'crackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated,' b'the op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (it is' b'cheap...somewhat $10/di-box).' b'not sure, but craig anderton did introduce one di-box project' b'in guitar player mag years ago (transformerless).....' b'' b' thanks a lot!' b'' b'hope this helps. email, if more details wanted....' b'' b' mein kopf ist ein labyrinth, mein leben ist ein minenfeld b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'the university of oulu' b'department of electrical engineering -just a student' b'finland' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'home is where the heart lies,' b'but if the heart lies where is home?' b'-fish'
