b'' b'my previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or' b"something. i've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the" b"approved method: slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target," b'then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. this time, it' b"didn't work because i didn't have time. riding up the hill leading to my" b'house, i encountered a liver-and-white springer spaniel (no relation to' b'the springer softail, or the springer spagthorpe, a close relation to' b'the spagthorpe viking). actually, the dog encountered me with intent to' b'harm.' b'' b'but i digress: i was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the' b'roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks mph' b'for the velocity-impaired). the dog shot at me from behind bushes on the' b'left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. i later learned he' b'had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,' b'heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. i' b'saw the dog, and before you could say sipde, he was on me. boom! i took' b'the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was' b'driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent' b'marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. i think' b'i saw the dog spin around when i looked back, but my memory of this' b'moment is hazy.' b'' b'i next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. the' b'apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut' b'mouth) and hoped i was not hurt either. i could feel the pain in my' b'shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. sadly, it has not.' b"so i'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!" b'' b'interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never' b'moved off course. the not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike' b'off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some' b'gut reaction to the sudden impact. delayed pain may have helped me' b"here, as i didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that i can remember." b'' b"what worries me about the accident is this: i don't think i could have" b'prevented it except by traveling much slower than i was. this is not' b'necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but i was' b'riding around the speed limit. i worry about what would have happened if' b'it had been a car instead of a dog, but i console myself with the' b'thought that it would take a truly insane bdi cager to whip out of a' b'blind driveway at mph. for that matter, how many driveways are' b'long enough for a car to hit mph by the end?' b'' b'i eagerly await comment.' b'' b'ryan cousinetc.|1982 yamaha vision xz550 -black pig of inverness|live to ride' b'kotrb ajs c/s -king rat |to work to' b"dod# |i'd be a squid if i could afford the bike... |flame to" b'' b'' b'* slmr 2.1a "he\'s hurt."
