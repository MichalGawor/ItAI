b'' b'tim belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as cincinnati won' b'their second straight pittsburgh lefty randy tomlin was hit early and' b'often by the heavily right-unbalanced reds line-up, which managed some' b'recently rare power with their bats.' b'' b'belcher was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the' b'game progressed. early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those' b'were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while' b'striking out nine. in a post game interview he said his change-up was working' b'for him--i should say so: all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on' b'breaking balls.' b'' b'tomlin on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch' b'double to lead-off batter bip roberts. bobby kelly followed with a single and' b'barry larkin scored roberts with a sharp single to right. the big guys' b'(mitchell, sabo, milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact' b'they all struck out--but kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal' b'and a tomlin wild pitch.' b'' b'in fact, it appeared that tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky' b'start-- he retired of the next batters to get to the fourth behind only' b'2-0. randy milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was' b'poorly played by orlando merced and turned into a triple. milligan would' b"later score on reggie sanders' sacrifice fly, giving cinci the lead" b'after b'' b'the fifth inning spelled loss for tomlin when roberts led off with his second' b'double of the game, and one batter later larkin smacked a double down the' b'left field line, chasing tomlin. barry later would score the final run on' b"tom prince's two-base passed ball." b'' b'the pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the' b'fifth when merced and kevin young hit back-to-back singles (the second' b'being of the "bunt" variety), but carlos garcia struck out, prince fit a' b'foul fly, and pinch-hitter lonnie smith "k\'d" to end any pittsburgh hope.' b'' b'pittsburgh pitchers backed tomlin up well, though: relievers blas minor,' b'moeller (sp?), and nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings' b'work.' b'' b'barry larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played' b'bruised his right thumb. he was taken to the hospital for "precautionary' b'x-rays". let\'s hope he\'s ok.' b'' b'cincinnati is now still the worst record in the majors, but with the' b'two wins they may be looking at moving out of the cellar!' b'pittsburgh
