b'' b'greetings,' b'i have an epson hi-80 pen plotter forsale. it emulates an hp b"or i'm not sure which. it has an option board on it that does" b'the emulation. it has a serial interface with hardware handshake. i' b'also have pens for it as follows: packs of black oil based, b'packs of red,green, blue, and black pens, packs of aqueous black,' b'7 packs of aqueous r,g,blue,black, pack of aqueous multi color' b'pens, and assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.' b'' b'the plotter is used. i have tested it using the windows drivers for' b'hp and hp and both worked fine. it accepts either a or b' b'sized paper. x or 11x17).' b'' b'i figure that the plotter is worth about and the pens are worth at' b"least another more.. one thing is certain, you won't need to" b'purchase any pens for quite a while... all of the packaged pens were' b'sealed so they are all still fresh. the rest were capped and seem to' b'function as well.' b'' b"i'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in" b'just them.' b'' b"i'm selling it because i got a hp laserjet and i don't need color." b'' b"i'd like or best offer..." b'' b'-chert' b'--' b'panic: the cat is nibbling on the power cord!'
