b'(c) comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)' b'(d) comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)' b'(e) comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)' b'' b'this is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting' b'and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to' b'comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. the first attempt failed in the summer' b'of (the voting deadline was august the voting rules' b'state

(gcc/2' b'and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred' b'a continuing deluge of software ported from unix platforms, such' b'as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and' b'much more. borland has released its c/c++ compiler for os/2 2.x,' b'allowing for easier porting of dos and windows software.' b'' b'much of the pc hardware and drivers were written for dos, and' b'later, windows. as more people are discovering os/2 2.x, the' b"number of people asking questions about os/2's compatibility" b'with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the' b'availability of drivers for their hardware, installation' b'procedures, etc.' b'' b'multimedia is becoming popular. os/2 supports windows' b'multimedia extensions using win-os/2 furthermore, ibm is' b'including direct multimedia support in os/2 starting with version' b'2.1 (in addition to using win-os/2 b'' b'any non-trivial software will have bugs os/2 is not exempt,' b'especially since ibm is constantly adding new features to os/2.' b'so far, ibm has issued system patches and corrective service disks' b'(e.g. the service pak) for free (free from bbss and ftp sites, or' b'for free plus a small media charge for diskettes read' b'comp.os.os2.misc for details).' b'' b'' b'proposed charters:' b'' b'(a) create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)' b'' b'it will provide a forum for developers of ported software so' b'as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and' b'spur additional development. the group will also cover' b'topics such as porting from other platforms (such as dos,' b'windows, unix, etc), toolkits which aid in program' b'portability (including porting tools such as mirrors), and' b'so forth.' b'' b'(b) rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)' b'' b'to keep the structure of the os/2 newsgroup heirarchy' b'orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to' b'comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.' b'' b'comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup' b'for os/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and' b'technical aspects of os/2 in an unmoderated setting.' b'' b'(c) create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)' b'' b'it will be devoted to os/2 system setup topics, including the' b'availability of device drivers, compatibility information,' b'installation procedures, system requirements, and overall' b'performance optimization.' b'' b'(d) create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)' b'' b'it will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.' b'' b'(e) create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)' b'' b'it will provide a forum for os/2 system bug reports, bug' b'diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system' b'patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.' b'' b'[note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other' b'newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in os/2 betas belong in' b'comp.os.os2.beta]' b'' b'' b'how to vote:' b'' b'to cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.' b'many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this' b'post. be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of' b'this post.' b'' b'1) type in your vote for each proposal:' b'' b'if you favor the charter as proposed, put a "yes" after its name.' b'if you oppose the charter as proposed, put a "no" after its name.' b'to abstain, leave a blank after its name.' b'' b'2) type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and' b'your first name (i.e. your personal name).' b'' b'3) cut out the ballot, please do not
