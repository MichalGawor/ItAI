b'' b'' b'in history seems to imply some pretty serious sin. the one of the' b'pastors in the church i attend, christchurch city elim, considers' b'that a prophesy of a natural disaster as a "judgement from the lord"' b'is a clear sign that the "prophesy" is not from the lord.' b'' b'i would like to see his reasoning behind this. you may have gotten' b'' b'if i get a chance i will ask them this weekend.' b'' b'"burned" by natural disaster prophecies down there, but that' b'does not mean that every natural disaster/judgement prophecy is' b'false. take a quick look at the book of jeremiah and it is obvious' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'that judgement prophecies can be valid. here in the us, it seems like' b'we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies, though i' b'am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement.' b'' b'the words i have underlined are at the heart of the problem. a "quick' b'look" doesn\'t do justice to the depth of the book of jeremiah. having' b'studied the jeremiah/ezekial period solidly for over a year at one' b'stage of my life, i have to say that there is a great deal of underlying' b'theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. let me make one point.' b'the clash between jeremiah and the "false prophets" was primarily in' b'the theological realm. the "false prophets" understood their relatioship' b'to god to be based on the covenant that the lord made with david. it is' b'possible to trace within the pages of the old testament who this covenant,' b"which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of david's" b'descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part' b"of the lord to keep a descendant of david's upon the throne and to never" b'allow jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. jeremiah was not a' b'judahite prophet. he was from anathoth, across the border in what had formerly' b'been israelite territory. when he came to prophesy, he came from the' b'theological background of the covenant the lord had made with israel' b'through moses. the northern kingdom had rejected the davidic covenant' b'after the death of solomon. his theology clashed with the theology of the' b'local prophets. it was out of a very deep understanding of the mosaic' b'covenant and an actute awareness of international events that jeremiah' b'spoke his prophesies. the "judgement prophesies" were deeply loaded with' b'theological meaning.' b'' b'in my opinion, both the portland earthquake prophesy and the david wilkerson' b'"new york will burn" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic' b'theological depths of the jeremiah prophesies.' b'' b'--' b'___' b'bill rea (o o)' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------w--u--w---' b'| christchurch, new zealand phone fax b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
