b'' b'date: apr gmt' b'did anyone notice the words "not for baseball" printed on the picture' b'of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa' b'today? any reason given for this?' b'' b'' b'i would assume that the words (i saw the picture) indicated that those' b'seats will not be available for baseball games. if you look at the picture' b'of the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked "not for' b'baseball", those seats just look terrible for watching baseball. now, if' b'they should happen to reach the post-season, i would imagine that they' b'would consider opening some of those seats up, but that is surely a worry' b'of the future.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'"in the champion, people see what they\'d like to be. in the loser,' b'they see what they actually are, and they treat him with scorn."' b'' b'"sugary condiments secure initial pleasure, but fermented grain is' b'decidedly more parsimonious of time."'
