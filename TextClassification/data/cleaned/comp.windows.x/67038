b'' b'' b" actually, i must also ask the faq's most popular reason why graphics" b" don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your" b' rectangle?' b'' b' suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains' b' xlib graphics. a button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item' b' to be drawn in the window. this action clearly should not call xcopyarea()' b' (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new' b' item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care' b' of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the' b' window is mapped.' b'' b' the problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window' b' is visible and mapped. do you know the best way to "tickle" a window so' b' that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?' b'' b'i specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment' b'came from a simple "open-draw-quit" client.' b'' b'as per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and' b'then call the "window_redraw()" (or whatever) directly? although, depending' b'on how the overall application is structured, there may be no problem with' b'rendering the object directly in response to the button press.' b'' b'ken' b'' b'--' b'kenneth whaley\t\t\t b'2630 walsh avenue' b'santa clara, ca.
