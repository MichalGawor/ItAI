b'' b'since at least one other person was interested in this:' b'' b"my fzr's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired." b'yesterday i bought a can of vht degree black header paint and spent an' b'hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand. sprayed on paint. thought' b'about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that' b"i wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint wore/chipped off in a month." b'' b'soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder' b'coating, while extremely durable, will not handle over degree' b'temperatures. the place i talked to said they were experimenting with' b"some new powder that is supposed to handle degrees but that it wouldn't" b'be available for months at least. they directed me to another shop that' b'specializes in header coating.' b'' b'the other shop said they have coatings available. one is aluminized that' b'can do degrees and is "comparable" to powder coating for durability.' b'the other is silicon (i think) based and can do degrees but is' b'thinner and not as durable. both coatings have a textured finish (not' b'super smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush.' b'' b"price for 1-foot header pipes and a 2-foot collector was i'm" b'planning to take the parts up friday and get them back (ups) next week maybe' b'wednesday.' b'' b'sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint' b'considering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap/rocks.' b'' b'axel'
