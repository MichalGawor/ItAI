b'' b'' b'' b'yes, you get internal mixing of the analog cd-audio outputs with' b'the mac generated audio on the mac motherboard. also you can sample' b'the cd-audio using the sound control panel by clicking on the options' b'button next to the microphone icon.' b'' b' what\'s this? my iivx with an internal cd doesn\'t have any "cd-audio"' b' icon...' b'' b"i can't find any such option on my centris either. on the other hand, i" b"don't see why i need one. if i try recording sound with the built-in" b'microphone with an audio cd playing in the drive, i get the cd audio mixed' b'in with the microphone sound.' b'' b"and i guess if i unplug the microphone, then i'll get uncontaminated cd" b'audio (admittedly sampled at bits through a d-a-d conversion).' b'' b'sorry about the misinformation. i made a bad assumption about' b'the new machines behaving like a quadra see previous' b'post. about sampling the cd audio though, have you tried it? i' b'found the aliasing to be really bad. like it needed a filter or something.' b'much worse than i expected. i installed the cd-300 in the' b'quadra myself so maybe i missed something. everything else' b'works great though.'
