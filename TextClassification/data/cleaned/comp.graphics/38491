b'' b'' b'the idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not' b'necessarily rectangular) as a window. my problem then is in' b'finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons"' b'from the first one. is this simply a matter of extending the' b'usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked' b'against another polygon??? is there a simpler way??' b'' b'comments welcome.' b'' b'noel.'
