b'' b'i have two questions (well probably more...) about how expose configure' b'events are handled.' b'' b'i have an appl. which uses window to draw in. since i give the user the' b'capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be' b'resized, i made a translation table for the expose configure events.' b'the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event' b'calls my rescale method. the rescale method invokes a "fake" expose' b'event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate expose struct)' b'to draw the data.' b'' b'quest b'when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r4 (running in either r4 or r5 env.)' b'i get multiple redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size' b"is changed. i assume i'm getting cascading events. is that right?" b'any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?' b'' b'quest b'when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r5 i get no expose events' b'whatsoever. do events and/or translation tables act differently in r5?' b'' b'thanks in advance' b'' b'steve' b'--' b'==========================================================================================' b'' b'steve kelley\tumcp cs/umiacs\t\t\tcaptain, i protest!'
