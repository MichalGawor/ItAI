b'' b'| the battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold. the temperature' b'| combined with self-discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of' b"| the battery. i strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesn't" b'| go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite' b'| cooler.' b'' b'please explain how cement is able to maintain a lower average temperature' b'than dirt. sheesh.......' b'' b"it's not the temperature, it's the karma. you see, dirt has good karma," b"since it's all organic and full of living things, but cement is all squared" b'off and artificial looking, and has lost its karma in the process. being' b'a karma sink, it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no' b'longer able to keep a charge. because wood is also good and organic, putting' b'a board between the battery and the cement will fix the problems.' b'' b'the buddha-nature is in the acid, but it is also in the lead plate. the' b'novice asked the master whether the spongy lead had more of the karma or' b'whether the solid lead had it. the master handed the novice a 250v b battery,' b'terminals downward, and thus the novice was enlightened.' b'--scott'
