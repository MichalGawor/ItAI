b'' b'jeff,' b'i have answers to both of your questions. first, i recommend the sony' b'cpd-1320 monitor. it is a trinitron vga monitor, but it is designed' b'specifically for use with the lc. it works only with macs with specific video' b"capabilities which means only the lc's and anything after the ci. all it" b'takes is a mac<-vga cable (i recommend one from james engineering which is' b'about these cost about as compared to the much higher prices of' b'comparable monitors because they are not multisynch. i have used one for half' b'a year and i love it.' b'second, i have used syex and found them to be decent. i had a backorder on a' b'supra modem which i cancelled. they were helpful in explaining the reasons' b"why there were delays and they had supra's number ready for me. the only" b'complaint was that they did not always return my calls.' b"i have been told that the cpd-1320 is selling for from j&r's" b"(800)221-8180. i think syex is a little more, but i don't know." b'' b'-david' b'' b'**** from planet bmug, the firstclass bbs of bmug. the message contained in' b"**** this posting does not in any way reflect bmug's official views." b''
