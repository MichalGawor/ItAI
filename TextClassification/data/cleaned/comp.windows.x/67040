b'' b'i found an oddity with our sgi indigo (mips r3000 chip).' b'when xlock +nolock is running, and i am working remotely' b'or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed' b'by using clock() in the code itself) is slower than if' b'xlock is not running. no other processes seem to affect my' b'runtimes, yet this is very consistent!' b'' b'any explanations, real or imagined b'' b'thanx'
