b'' b"les bartel's comments:" b"sorry i can't help you with your question, but i do have a comment to" b'make concerning aftermarket a/c units. i have a frost-king or frost-temp' b'(forget which) aftermarket unit on my cavalier, and am quite unhappy with' b"it. the fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air. i will never have" b"an aftermarket a/c installed in any of my vehicles again. i just can't" b'trust the quality and performance after this experience.' b' les' b'' b'let me add my in. i had a a/c installed by the ford garage and it did not' b'work as well as the a/c that was installed by the factory in pickups' b'identical to mine. i have talked to other people that have had the same' b"result. don't know if this is just a probable with ford or what??" b'' b'\ternie smith' b'' b'i agree, *never* have the dealer add anything to your car. if you want a/c' b"make sure it is factory installed(honda's maybe excluded, many can't be" b'bought with a/c installed at the factory, but i think, maybe, they actually' b'use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one in...as' b'in bigger radiator etc...or are designed properly for this in the 1st place),' b"anyway, my point is the dealer installed a/c won't be anywhere near as good" b'as factory *and* the service bums will mess up your car when installing it...' b'scratches, screwdriver holes in seats...parts not reinstalled correctly or' b'with all the screws etc. i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm' b'dealer for years...he said never have a dealer add anything to your car...' b'except, maybe, floormats...' b'' b''
