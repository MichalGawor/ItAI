b'' b" if i read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger" b' economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a' b' lunar facility. that was certainly partially the case with apollo,' b' but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing' b' military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than' b' just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.' b'' b'ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not' b"wasted on the moon. it's not like they'd be using (1000r?) bills" b'to fuel their moon-dozers. the money to fund a lunar base would be' b"spent in the country to which the base belonged. it's a way of funding" b'high-tech research, just like darpa was a good excuse to fund various' b'fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the' b'defense of the country, or like esprit is a good excuse for the ec to' b"fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-european" b'cooperation.' b'' b'now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of' b"money (in fact, i'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as" b'investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at' b'the size of that multiplier b'' b'actually i favor government funded research. it *is* a pump prime' b'for a lot of basic technologies. i also understand the short term' b"value of high tech welfare programs. but they can't substitute for" b"long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise. that's what's" b'needed to maintain a healthy economy *anywhere*, on earth or luna.' b"i don't see that long term potential on luna due to a bunch of" b'factors i outline in another post.' b'' b'gary' b'--' b'gary coffman ke4zv you make it, gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary' b'destructive testing systems we break it. uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary' b'534 shannon way guaranteed! emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary' b'lawrenceville, ga
