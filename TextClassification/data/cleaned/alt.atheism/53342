b'' b'' b'' b'i think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how' b"deviant the view _as i've articulated it above_ (which may not be" b'the true view of khomeini) is from the basic principles of islam.' b'' b"from the point ov view of an atheist, i see you claim khomeini wasn't" b"practicing true islam. but i'm sure that he would have said the same about" b'you. how am i, a member of neither group, supposed to be able to tell which' b'one of you two is really a true muslim?' b'' b'this is a very good point. i have already made the clear claim that' b"khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the qur'an" b'and have given my arguments for this. this is something that can be' b'checked by anyone sufficiently interested. khomeini, being dead,' b"really can't respond, but another poster who supports khomeini has" b'responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. this should' b'be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist' b'modes of obfuscationism.' b'' b'so, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning' b"more about islam, that is by reading the qur'an and understanding it's" b'basic principles. once one has done this it is relatively easy to see' b'who is following the principles of islam and who is acting in a way at' b'odds with islam. khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve' b'muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles' b'of islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than' b'any other human being and in no sense any closer to god in metaphysical' b'nature.' b'' b'' b'gregg' b''
