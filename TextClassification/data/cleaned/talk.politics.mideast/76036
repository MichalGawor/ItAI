b'' b'' b'| typical arabic thinking. if we are guilty of something, so is' b'| everyone else. unfortunately for you, nabil, jewish tribes are not' b'| nearly as susceptible to the fratricidal murdering that is still so' b'| common among arabs in the middle east. there were no killings' b'| between the jewish tribes on the way."' b'' b'i don\'t like this comment about "typical" thinking. you could state' b'your interpretation of exodus without it. as i read exodus i can see' b'a lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible' b'in ideological/religious colors. the history in the desert can be seen' b"as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. that's why i think" b'it is a great book with which descendants arabs, turks and mongols can' b'unify as well.' b'' b"you somehow missed nabil's comments, even though you included it in" b'your followup:' b'' b'the number which could have arrived to the holy lands must have been' b'substantially less ude to the harsh desert and the killings between the' b'jewish tribes on the way..' b'' b'i am not aware of "killings between jewish tribes" in the desert.' b'' b'the point of "typical thinking" here is that while arabs still today' b'act in the manner you describe, like "any nomadic people occupying a' b'land", killing and plundering each other with regularity, others have' b'somehow progressed over time. it is not surprising then that arabs' b'often accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar' b'with: civil rights violations, religious discrimination, ethnic' b'cleansing, land theft, torture and murder. it is precisely this' b'mechanism at work that leads people to say that jewish tribes were' b'killing each other in the desert, even without support for such a' b'ludicrous suggestion.' b'' b'--' b'american-occupied new york have replaced jimmy carter as the' b'my opinions only employer has no opinions. standard of a failed president.'
