b'' b'' b'we are using pkzip v2.04 and i am interested to hear from' b'people who have used one of the many windows programs that' b'call these.' b'which ones are available and does any one stand out amongst' b'the rest?' b'' b"well, i got winzip from cica (don't know which version, but i think" b"it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and i was initially imressed." b"but here's the low-down:" b'' b'winzip is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*. it lets you' b'vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a' b'/checkout directory, and creates a "checkout" .grp and group if you want' b'to check the program out. it even prompts for deletion of these on' b'exit, if you didn;t like the program.' b'' b"*however* (big however over here). i have problems zipping. i don't" b'konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when i' b'"zip" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something' b"or other, and i'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit" b"all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer. i don't know" b"(as i said) how consistent this is, as i jdont' zip much (and when i do," b'now i just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the "run" cmd)' b"but i *do* know it's happened when i added files to an existing .zip" b'file, *and* when i created a new .zip file, using selected files only.' b"i don't know if it's happened when i zip an entire dir." b'' b'still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful "unzip"ing' b"functions. if the above is fixed, i'll be the first to register the new" b'ver. (as for now, a good old, "run--unzip *.zip" will work.' b'' b'(ps if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know).' b'' b'peace,' b'mickey' b'--' b'ace|| ...!uunet!seas.gwu.edu!louray' b'|||| *how do make a ms-windows .grp file reflect a hd directory??*' b'\\\\\\\\ "well i ain\'t always right, but i\'ve never been wrong.."(gd)'
