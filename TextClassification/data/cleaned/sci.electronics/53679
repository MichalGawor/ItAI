b'' b'can circuits found in electronics magazines (with no patent disclaimer)' b'be used legally as subcircuits of a commercial unit b'' b'there are two issues here: copyright and patent.' b'' b"the magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced," b"translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission. however, this" b'does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression. copying' b'their circuit diagram or pc-board pattern is copyright infringement. but' b"it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that" b'the circuit design itself is copyrighted. so long as you draw your own' b"diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue." b'' b'patents are different. the author does *not* have to give you any warning' b'that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for' b"him to do so). in fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone" b"else's patent without realizing it. ignorance of the patented status is" b'not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages' b'a court would award.' b'' b'however... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,' b'almost certainly it is "obvious to one skilled in the art" and therefore' b'unpatentable. routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)' b'cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.' b'' b'caution: i am not a lawyer. consulting a professional would be wise if' b'significant amounts of money are at stake.' b'--'
