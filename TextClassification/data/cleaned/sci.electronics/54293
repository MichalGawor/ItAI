b'' b'' b'i just bought a new portable cd player for the office, and i notice that' b'it proudly proclaims times oversampling" on the box.' b'' b'the data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course),' b'and eventually gets turned into khz, bit, two channel data.' b'oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points' b'between them for n times oversampling. when i asked, people said that the' b'interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more' b'complicated.' b'' b'you are quite correct in your understanding.' b'' b'in case you care, the filtering method uses an fir (finite impulse response)' b"filter. i'd guess that cd makers use the same kind of method. anybody out" b'there know the real answer?' b'' b'typical (in the old 2x-oversampling units) was a thirteen-tap' b'fir, implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit. at this kind' b'of speed (slow, by digital standards) such an adder is much less' b'expensive than analog components of comparable precision.' b'' b'i gleaned this information from a hardware manual for' b'an old cd player design; where one would find similar info for' b'a particular cd (the digital filter is an interesting component,' b'from my point of view), i have no idea. the digital filter' b'is a kind of interpolation scheme (read a book on numerical' b"analysis, to see just how broad the term 'interpolation' is...)," b'' b'' b'john whitmore' b'' b''
