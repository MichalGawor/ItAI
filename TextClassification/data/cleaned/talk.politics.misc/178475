b'' b"i couldn't disagree with you more strongly. it sounds good, but in" b'practice it too often becomes tyranny, because there are too often' b'conflicting ideas of what constitutes "improving the human condition".' b'far better to let people and their organizations pursue whatever goals' b'they think best, and let "the human condition" be improved by those who' b'are willing to do so without coercion.' b'' b'there will always be conflicting ideas on what constitutes "improving the' b'human condition", that\'s humanity. you seem to believe that libertarianism' b'will improve the human condition by lifting all constraints, and that' b'people will have a better chance of improving themselves in that environment.' b'' b'let me try to put it another way. libertarians believe that an' b'unconstrained environment provides the best chance of solving any' b'problem because it maximizes creativity. however, there is never' b'any guarantee that a really good solution will ever be found to any' b'particular problem. "utopia is not an option."' b'' b'utopia is a myth (although we can do a lot better than what we have today).' b'but i think that you must pitch libertarianism as a progressive agenda' b'(ie you can do better under our style of system).' b'' b' i admire a lot of what the libertarians stand for, but you' b'guys are some of the worst salesmen i have ever seen. and when it comes to' b'politics, you need salesmen whether you want them or not.' b'' b'what we need are more people who agree with us, know something' b'about marketin, and are willing to both do that marketing and teach' b'others how to. are you in?' b'' b"i'm flattered by your invitation, but i'm afraid you have the wrong person." b"although i completely agree with your civil liberties agenda, i'm not" b'in support of your economic agenda. what i do like about the libertarian' b'party is that you guys are so good at shaking up the tired ideas of the' b"past. i encourage you guys to continue your crusade, but i'm afraid i" b"can't ride along." b'' b'ian sutherland' b'' b'"nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has garrett johnson' b'' b'/june' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'"nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has garrett johnson' b'"the probability of someone watching you is proportional' b'to the stupidity of your action." unknown' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
