b'' b'|' b"| i don't understand the point of this petty sarcasm. it is a basic" b'| principle of islam that if one is born muslim or one says "i testify' b'| that there is no god but god and mohammad is a prophet of god" that,' b'| so long as one does not explicitly reject islam by word then one _must_' b"| be considered muslim by all muslims. so the phenomenon you're attempting" b'| to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic' b'| islamic principles. if you want to attack islam you could do better than' b'| than to argue against something that islam explicitly contradicts.' b'' b'then mr mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing' b'bad acts, people temporarily become atheists?' b'' b'jon.'
