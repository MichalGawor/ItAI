b'' b'' b'' b' mike terry asks:' b'' b' is it possible to do a "wheelie" on a motorcycle with shaft-drive?' b' b' no mike. it is imposible due to the shaft effect. the centripital effects' b' of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift' b' off the ground.' b' b' dod #650<-----------------------------------------------------------darkman' b'well my last two motorcycles have been shaft driven and they will wheelie.' b'the rear gear does climb the ring gear and lift the rear which gives an' b'odd feel, but it still wheelies.'
