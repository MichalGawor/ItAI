b'' b'' b"i'm wondering if i can tote my american touch tone phone around with me" b"to sweden and germany. it's dc powered, and i can buy a special adapter" b'for that in europe. the question is if the general electronics work' b"the same. i can buy a different wall plug and refit it (i'm sure i'd" b'have to), but would that do the trick?' b'' b'thanks,' b'hugo'
