b'' b'earlier, i was reading on the net about using splitfire plugs. one' b'guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell. well,' b'i saw one think that someone said about "show me a team that used split-' b'fires...." well, here\'s some additional insight and some theories' b'about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.' b'' b'splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and' b'increased power for the 4x4 cages. well, for these guys, splitfires' b'' b"now i don't know about all of this (and i'm trying to catch up with" b'somebody about it now), but splitfires should help twins more than' b'' b'splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the' b"combustion chamber. if an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this," b'then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably' b"in lower rpm range torque. splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my gmc" b'pickup (4.3l v6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my harley' b"sportster and my best friend's sportster folks i know who've" b"tried them in evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain" b'plugs (which is interesting since the xlh and big twin evo combustion chambers' b'are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). two of my friends who' b'have shovelhead harleys swear by the splitfires but if i had a shovelhead,' b"i'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make" b'the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look' b'really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)' b'--' b'=============================================================================' b"neal howard xlh-1200 dod computrac, inc (richardson, tx)" b"std disclaimer: my opinions are mine, not computrac's." b'"let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps' b'we shall learn the truth." august kekule\' b'============================================================================='
