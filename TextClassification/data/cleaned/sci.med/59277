b'' b"i've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and" b"demented during hospital stays. in the examples i've seen, drugs were" b'definitely involved.' b'' b'my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the' b'hospital. he was fifty-three at the time, and he was on separate' b'medications. the family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling' b'us that none of the drugs interact. they even took the attitude that, if' b'he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! with' b'the help of an md friend of the family, we had all his medication' b'discontinued. he had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug.' b"two days later, he was his old self again. i guess there aren't many" b'medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.' b'' b"i don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. it is an" b'aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. docs seem to believe' b"that, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to" b'take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. that control reduces' b'the chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care' b'providers can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those' b'circumstances.' b'' b"i grant you that sometimes there's no choice. nevertheless, i suggest" b'you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss' b'it with an independent doc. her problems may not be the effect of haldol' b'at all. haldol may have been used validly, or it may have been' b'prescribed because other medication confused her, and because the' b'hospital normally prescribes haldol for the confused elderly.' b'' b'just my opinion,' b'' b'-larry (obviously not a doc) c.' b'' b''
