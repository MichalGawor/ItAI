b'' b'' b'hi folks.' b'' b"as part of my self-introduction to x i've been trying to do some simple" b'icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows). changing your' b'own applications icon is fairly simple: if you have a widget id you can' b"just xtsetvalues on xtniconifypixmap (or whatever) and you're done. alternately" b"you can set window manager hints. these methods don't seem to work with" b"icons which your application doesn't specifically own." b'' b'in my situation i have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in' b'my icon box so my question is: given a window-id, how do you change the' b'icon pixure a working example would be very much appreciated. if it makes' b"any difference, i'm using motif on vms t6.0-5ke." b'' b'thanks b'scott
