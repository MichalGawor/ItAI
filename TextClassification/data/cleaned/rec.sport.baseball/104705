b'' b'' b'' b'however, what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games.' b'you are the first person non-mediot i have seen endorse this policy.' b'i have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the' b'espn crowd and other announcers bitching about it. i have never' b'been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and' b'shouting "hurry up!" if i cough up big bucks for a ticket, i don\'t mind' b"a game that last more than i really don't understand it." b'' b"i agree with nick. what's the big deal about long games? if you want" b"to watch baseball, there's that much more baseball to watch. and yes," b'baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.' b'' b'first, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless' b'you include watching the grass grow as baseball. the lengthier games' b'are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking' b'longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers' b'and pitching coaches.' b'' b"and while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this" b"is only true when they don't become extra-long. quickly-pitched games" b'can grab and hold your attention much better.' b'' b'bring back the two-hour baseball game! (and the three and a half hour' b'golf game with it!)' b'--' b'|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|' b'| michael zimmers voice: b'| softhelp suppliers to software developers data: b'|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|'
