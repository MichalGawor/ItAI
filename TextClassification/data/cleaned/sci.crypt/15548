b'' b'' b"finally, can anyone even concieve of a time/place where bit keys aren't" b"sufficient? (i certainly can't even at a trillion keys a second, it" b'would take about billion years to search just one billionth of that keys' b'space.)' b'' b'it depends on the attack. adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of' b'work to be done in a straight brute-force attack, where you try every single' b'possible key until one works. processing and storage requirements for this' b'kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively' b'impossible. however, there may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for' b'example) proportional to, say, 2**sqrt(n), or some such. also, a long' b'key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little' b'of the key at a time....' b'' b'thanks,' b'dane' b'--john'
