b'' b'' b'\tmy problem with science is that often it allows us to' b'assume we know what is best for ourselves. god endowed us' b'with the ability to produce life through sexual relations,' b'for example, but he did not make that availible to everyone.' b"does that mean that if science can over-ride god's decision" b'through alterations, that god wills for us to have the power' b'to decide who should and should not be able to have' b'children? should men be allowed to have babies, if that' b'is made possible.' b'' b"in a word, yes. i don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of" b'impact on the power of god. in the past, god gave us the ability to create' b'life through sexual relations. now, he is giving us the ability to create life' b'through in vitro fertilization. the difference between the two is merely' b"cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to" b'approach the glory of god.' b'the power we are being given is a test, and i am sure that in many cases we' b'will use our new abilities unwisely. but, people have been using sexuality' b"unwisely for millenia and i haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!" b"no matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't" b"impinging on god's power. it's only when we attempt to gain control of the" b"spiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and" b'logic, that we begin to interfere with god.' b'' b'alan terlep\t\t\t\t "...and the scorpion says, \'it\'s' b'oakland university, rochester, mi\t\tin my nature.\'"'
