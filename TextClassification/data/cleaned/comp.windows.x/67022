b'' b'' b'i am developing an x (xt,xm) application that will include a graphics window' b'of some sort with moving symbols among other things. a pure x application' b'could be implemented with motif widgets, one of which would be an' b'xmdrawingarea for drawing with xlib. but i would like to take advantage of' b"the graphics library (gl) available on our ibm rs/6000 (sgi's gl i believe)." b'' b'is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program?' b'can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me' b'with xopenwindow?' b'' b'i have never used gl before, but the doc on gl winopen() says that the first' b'time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server. also, most of' b'the gl calls do not require a display or gc, unlike most x calls. from this' b'initial information it appears that x and gl cannot be mixed easily. is this' b'true?' b'' b'does pex (graphigs?) have the same functionality of gl?' b'' b'' b'environment:' b'aixwindows x11r4' b'motif b'gl is available' b'aix sys v b'ibm rs/6000 b'' b'' b'thanks in advance.' b'' b'jay graham' b'jade simulations international corp.' b'14 colonnade road, suite b'nepean, ontario, canada' b'613-225-5900 x226' b'' b''
