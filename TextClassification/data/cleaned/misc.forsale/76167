b'' b' i had the front panel of my car stereo stolen this weekend.' b'' b' i need to buy the front panel of a sony xr-u770 car stereo.' b'' b'i was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable-front-panels' b'were to make the radio useless, and thus discourage theft (that is if the' b'cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left.)' b'' b'if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio' b'originally costs, or even sold at all,' b"then the above discouragement wouldn't be so great." b'' b'i personally would be unhappy, if i bought a radio like that, thinking that' b"removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio's value, and the covers were" b'sold by the company (or other legitimate source) cheaply.' b'--' b'' b'the front covers should be available from sony. check with a local car' b'stereo shop. you will probably (definitely) have to provide the units' b'serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card. i' b"don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people" b'who damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.' b'' b'as to deterring theft:' b'' b'when i worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a sony b'number. we would not sell the face, nor did we have them available. most' b'people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that' b'matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck' b"they couldn't use. if theft occurs with these decks, notify sony. serial" b'numbers do catch theives.' b'' b'just a thought,' b'michael' b''
