b'' b'most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this,' b'but the branch davidian compound is no more. this morning about b'the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank. they' b'then started using non-lethal tear gas. shortly after noon, cult' b'members were seen setting fire to the compound. so far, about b'people have been seen outside the compound. the fate of the other or' b'70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the children that were' b'inside. the compound did burn to the ground.' b'' b'koresh, who at times has claimed to be the messiah, but then backed off' b'and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come' b'out peacefully if his demands were met. first, he demanded that his' b"message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out." b'he claimed to be waiting for a message from god. finally, he said that' b'god told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the seals in' b"revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out. he finished the" b"first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then." b"the federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they" b'would be subjected to tear gas.' b'' b"i think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere" b'man, even if he did claim to be the son of god, and/or a prophet. i' b'think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in' b'things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the scriptures' b'say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you,' b'even if those others are learned and mean well.' b'' b'paul conditt'
