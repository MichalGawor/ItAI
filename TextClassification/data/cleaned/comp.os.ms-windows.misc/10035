b'' b'i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most' b'eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa' b'counterparts. for instance, the eisa orchid pro designer iis-e is' b'only about as "fast" as the isa diamond speedstar plus, which isn\'t' b'what i would call "fast."' b'' b"i don't understand why eisa video cards aren't, as a group, on the" b'same level of performance as local bus cards, given that eisa video' b"cards have a bit bus to move data around, instead of isa's bits." b'' b'since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher' b'cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than' b'and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board, such as a' b"diamond speedstar 24x? from pc magazine's (i think) recent report," b"i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card, but it's" b'around which is just about double what my wallet will allow' b'me to spend. and, for i could get a diamond viper and still' b"have left over (of course, i'd have to get a local bus mother-" b'board too...)' b'' b'can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?' b'' b'' b''
