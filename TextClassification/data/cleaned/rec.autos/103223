b'' b'' b"water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's ford probe. every" b'once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water' b'under the plywood/carpet cover on the trunk. i would guess this usually happens' b'after a good thunder storm. a few qs:' b'' b'1) is this a common problem?' b'' b'yes this is a common problem. the leaks occur through the seal of the' b'taillights. unfortunately, ford has this with most probes and does' b'not have a recall for it. very dissatisfying to say the least.' b'' b'2) where are the drain holes located for the hatch?' b'' b'there is no drain holes that i know of. i used a margine tub to drain it' b"regretably i waited three months as i was short cash and they wouldn't fix it" b'under warrantee. then i paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system' b'including a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in' b'the trunk. this resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would' b'not retract. so i ended up paying about to have the sensor replaced;' b'$90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket' b'which i insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that' b'when i proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the' b'covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.' b'' b"very annoying. don't let the water problem go--get it fixed or you'll pay" b'more later. considering how common a problem it is i hope every one' b'complains to ford.' b'' b'thanks for any info.' b'tom' b'' b'--' b'tom szeto "no! not those peanuts! the ones on the' b'#include <disclaimer.h homer simpson'
