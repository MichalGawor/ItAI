b'' b'the intent of my post (as i remember it) was to show that you cannot' b'argue against any religion (or ideology, for that matter) by the actions' b'of those who claim to be its followers. you have to look at the' b'teachings of the religion (or the principles of the ideology) _itself_.' b'there is no getting around this.' b'' b"so to argue against islam, you have to go to the qur'an. bringing up" b'khomeini (or anyone else) is relevant to discussing khomeini, but not' b'_necessarily_ relevant to discussing islam _as a religion_.' b'' b'sorry, fred, but for the purposes under discussion here, i must' b'disagree. your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue' b'against communism by reference to the chinese or soviet empires, since' b'those did not represent *true* communism. in judging the practical' b'consequences of islam as a force to contend with in the world today,' b"it is precisely the khomeini's of the world, the rushdie-fatwa" b'supporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world' b'muslim community to those extremists, that we must look to. perhaps' b'unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned' b'with whether islam is the right religion for them, or whether the' b"qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how" b'islam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like' b'if islam gains in influence. when i consider such possibilities, it' b'is with not inconsiderable fear.' b'--' b'these are my opinions. for a nominal fee, they can be yours.'
