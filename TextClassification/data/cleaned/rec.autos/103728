b'' b'hi javier, (how are things at corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?)' b'vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least,' b'by warped rotors. when the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure' b'on the rotor. turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem' b'as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).' b'there could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop' b'should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.'
