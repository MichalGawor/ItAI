b'' b' the mit tapes come with documentation written by keith packard on the shared' b' memory extension to x. look in: mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms' b' i found this invaluble. unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the' b' shared memory segments, making an ximage from it, etc. also, there is an' b' extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to' b' test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled' b' in the kernel. i have written layers of convience routines which make all this' b' transparent.' b' as for the xview code, well, i doubt that would be considered interesting.' b' the interesting stuff is done in a c object library. people interested in this' b' code can email me.' b'' b' \t\t\t\tregards,' b'' b' \t\t\t\t\trichard gooch,' b'' b'thanks for docs info. it turns out that if i leave out colormap updates between' b'frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 400x400x8 frames on an ipx using the' b'server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing frames per second! and' b"very smooth. i think i've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help" b'on this group!) however, i may have colormap questions later.....' b'' b'derek' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------' b'| derek c. richardson tel: x b'| institute of astronomy fax: b'| cambridge, u.k. b'-----------------------------------------------------------' b''
