b'' b'| there has been some discussion on the pros and cons about sex outside of' b'| marriage.' b'...' b'|' b'| where is the evidence for my opinions? at the moment, there are just' b'| generalities i can cite. for example, i read that in the 20th century,' b'| the percentage of youth (and people in general) who suffer from' b'| depression has been steadily climbing in western societies (probably' b'| what i was reading referred particularly to the usa). similarly, one' b'| can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage' b'| in this century in western societies particularly with the "sexual' b'| revolution" of the 60\'s, but even before that i think (otherwise the' b'| "sexual revolution" of the 60\'s would not have been possible),' b'| particularly with the gradual weakening of christianity and consequently' b'| christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage. i propose' b'| that these two trends greater level of general depression in society' b'| (and other psychological problems) and greater sexual promiscuity are' b'| linked, with the latter being a prime cause of the former. i cannot' b'| provide any evidence beyond this at this stage, but the whole thesis' b'| seems very reasonable to me and i request that people ponder upon it.' b'|' b'| fred rice a muslim, giving his point of view.' b'' b'i think this is a big leap sex-depression. one example is myself,' b'where no sex-depression but, seriously promiscuity is on a decline,' b'depression is not and it might be more reasonable to say' b'depression-promiscuity. i think depression is more likely to come' b'from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and' b'promiscuity is used as an escape.' b'since i see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an' b"emotional bond, i don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of)" b'marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as' b'what is expected from a married couple. of course, this is just' b'my opinion.' b'' b'brian
