b'' b'' b' robert, you keep making references to "orthodox" belief, and saying things' b'like "it is held that..." (cf. "kermit" thread). on what exact body of' b'theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?" who is that "holds' b'that" luke meant what you said he meant? whenever your personal interpretation' b'of biblical passages is challenged, your only response seems' b'to be that one needs merely to "look at the bible" in order to see the truth,' b'but what of those who see biblical things differently from you? are we to' b'simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it?' b'' b'rick, i think we can safely say, robert is not the only person' b'who understands the bible, and the leadership of the lds church' b'historicly never has. let\'s consider some "personal interpretations"' b'and see how much trust we should put in "orthodox mormonism", which' b'could never be confused with orthodox christianity.' b'' b'in one of his attacks on christians, the mormon apostle bruce r.' b'mcconkie said they "thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify' b'elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised' b'messiah." he also said christians are wrong to believe "that jehovah is' b'the supreme deity [god the father]," and that christ "came into' b'mortality" as his "only begotten" son. mcconkie then stated what mormons' b'believe today to be the truth about the matter. he said that "elohim is' b'the father" and "jehovah is the son."' b'' b'"being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists' b'have gone in defining their three-in-one god, it comes as no surprise' b'to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to' b'identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the' b'promised messiah. some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the' b'supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten. as' b'with their concept that god is a spirit, this misinformation about the' b'gods of heaven is untrue. the fact is, and it too is attested by holy' b'writ, that elohim is the father, and that jehovah is the son who was' b'born into mortality as the lord jesus christ, the promised messiah.' b'(promised messiah, p. b'' b'notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about' b'their "three-in-one god" and their belief that "god is a spirit" as they' b'are in their understanding of who "elohim" and "jehovah" are. before' b"examining mcconkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more" b'statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words' b'"elohim" and "jehovah." mcconkie stated:' b'' b'"...the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in' b'the old testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the' b'exalted name-title jehovah. (promised messiah, p. b'' b'"_elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted' b'name-title of god the eternal father, a usage that connotes his' b'supremacy and omnipotence, he being god above all gods. (mormon' b'doctrine, p. b'' b'agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who "elohim" and' b'"jehovah" are, the apostle james e. talmage stated:' b'' b'"_elohim_, as understood and used in the restored church of jesus' b'christ, is the name-title of god the eternal father, whose firstborn' b'son in the spirit is _jehovah_ the only begotten in the flesh,' b'jesus christ. (jesus the christ, p. b'' b'"a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve"' b'apostles of the mormon church states that "god the eternal father...[is]' b'designate[d] by the exalted name-title \'elohim\'..." (articles of faith,' b'p. "...christ in his preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied' b'state...was known as jehovah..." (articles of faith, p. b'' b'today mormon leaders teach that "elohim" in the ot refers to god' b'the father and "jehovah" refers to christ. mcconkie attacked christians' b'for saying "jehovah" can refer to the father. he stressed that these two' b'"name-titles" should not be changed around so that christ is called' b'"elohim" and the father is called "jehovah." "...the father...is elohim,' b'not jehovah.... jehovah is christ, and christ is jehovah; they are one' b'and the same person." (promised messiah, p. b'' b'in the ot of the kjv of the bible, the hebrew word "elohim" is' b'used to refer to the true god, false gods and goddesses, and the judges' b'of israel. when referring to the true god, "elohim" is translated with a' b'capital "g." when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges' b'of israel, it is translated with a small "g." it is translated four' b'times as "judges" (exod. once as "judge" sam. b'twice as "mighty" (gen. exod. once as "angels" (ps. b'once as "godly" (mal. once as "great" (gen. and once as' b'"very great." sam. b'' b'the word "jehovah" is the traditional pronunciation of the' b'tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word' b'"adonai." many people believe the true pronunciation of the' b'tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh. however, since "jehovah" rather' b'than yahweh is the word used by mormonism, this section will also use' b'"jehovah" instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of' b'mormon leaders regarding that name. "jehovah," unlike "elohim," is never' b'used of false gods. it is the personal name of the triune god of the' b'bible. in the kjv, "jehovah" is rendered primarily "lord," sometimes' b'"god," and rarely "lord."' b'' b'now that we understand something about the words "elohim" and' b'"jehovah" and their use by mormon leaders, we shall consider the apostle' b'mcconkie\'s attack on christians for believing the father is "jehovah."' b'in trying to prove that "jehovah" refers exclusively to christ, mcconkie' b"cited several verses from the bible. some of these verses and mcconkie's" b'interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.' b'remember, mcconkie said the father is not "jehovah;" he is only' b'"elohim." the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie\'s' b'interpretation of ps. of this verse he stated:' b'' b'"of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit' b'and he testified, "the lord said unto my lord, sit thou at my right' b'hand, until i make thine enemies thy footstool?" (ps. two' b'lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater' b'than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of' b'the other. who are they and what message is contained in this' b'messianic prophecy?' b'"what think ye of christ?" our lord asked certain of his detractors' b'toward the end of his mortal ministry. "whose son is he?" is christ' b'the son of god or of someone else? is he to be born of a divine parent' b'or will he be as other men a mortal son of a mortal father? that he' b'was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the' b'jews. and so they answered, "the son of david."' b"david's son? truly he was. but he was more, much more. and so our" b'lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,' b'asked, "how then doth david in spirit call him lord, saying, the lord' b'said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand, till i make thine' b'enemies thy footstool? if david then call him lord, how is he his' b'son?" that is, if he is only the son of david, how is it that the' b'great king, acting under inspiration, calls him lord and worships him' b'as such? and we might add: _who is the other lord, the one who spake' b"unto david's lord?_ can there be any question as to how jesus is" b"interpreting the words of the psalm? he is saying that it means: '_the" b'father said unto the son, elohim said unto jehovah_, sit thou on my' b'right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then i will raise you up' b'to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to' b"sit on my right hand forever.' (promised messiah, pp. b'(emphasis added)' b'' b'agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie, the following' b'remark in the mormon pamphlet _what the mormons think of christ, p. b'reads: "the lord [elohim, the father] said unto my lord [jehovah, the' b'son]..." (brackets in original)' b'' b'mcconkie clearly stated that it is "elohim" the father who is' b'speaking to "jehovah" the son in this psalm. however, when one looks at' b'the hebrew word translated "lord," it becomes apparent that either the' b'first "lord" is not the father or else the father is "jehovah." either' b'way mcconkie is wrong. the psalm reads:' b'' b'"the lord [jehovah] said unto my lord [adon], sit thou at my right' b'hand, until i make thine enemies thy footstool. (ps. b'' b'the first "lord" in this verse is "jehovah" who mormonism says' b'is christ, not the father. the second "lord" is the hebrew word "adon"' b'(singular for "adonai," meaning master or lord). if the first "lord" is' b'the father and the second "lord" is the son, then the father is' b'"jehovah" and the son is "adon." however, if the father is not "jehovah"' b'as mcconkie claimed, then the first "lord" is "jehovah" the son, but' b'who, then, is "adon?" obviously the father is "jehovah" in this psalm,' b'and his son is "adon."' b'' b'another example involves isa. about which mcconkie stated' b'the following:' b'' b'"i the lord have called thee in righteousness," _isaiah quoted the' b'father as saying of christ_, "and will hold thine hand, and will keep' b'thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the' b'gentiles." (isa. (promised messiah, p.

(isa. b'' b'according to mcconkie, "i the lord" refers to the father, and' b'"thine" and "thee" refer to christ. however, the "lord" who is speaking' b'is "jehovah" which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking' b'or else the father is "jehovah."' b'' b'another example involves ps. of these verses mcconkie' b'stated:' b'' b'"the same psalm says: "all they that see me laugh me to scorn: they' b'shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, he trusted on the lord' b'that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in' b'him." (ps. _the fulfillment, as jesus hung on the cross_, is' b'found in these words: "the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes' b'and elders, said, he saved others; himself he cannot save. if he be' b'the king of israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will' b'believe him. he trusted in god; let him deliver him now, if he will' b'have him: for he said, i am the son of god. the thieves also, which' b'were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth." (matt.' b'27:41-44.) (promised messiah, pp. (emphasis added)' b'' b'ps. reads as follows:' b'' b'"all they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they' b'shake the head, saying, he trusted on the lord [jehovah] that he would' b'deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.' b'' b'mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment "as jesus hung' b'on the cross." that means the person who was scorned in these verses was' b'christ. who, then, was the "lord" in whom he trusted? it was "jehovah"' b'the father.' b'' b'another example involves ps. and ps. regarding them,' b'mcconkie stated the following:' b'' b'"with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our' b'lord\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: "they took counsel' b'together against me, they devised to take away my life." (ps. b'as to the role of judas in those conspiracies, the psalmist says:' b'"mine own familiar friend, in whom i trusted, which did eat of my' b'bread, hath lifted up his heel against me." (ps. (promised' b'messiah, p. b'' b'apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christ\'s "arrest and' b'judicial trials." we shall first consider ps. and then ps. while' b'mcconkie only quoted verse of ps. verse will also be included' b'to give a complete understanding of the matter.' b'' b'"for i have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while' b'they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my' b'life. but i trusted in thee, o lord [jehovah]: i said, thou art my god' b'[elohim]. (ps. b'' b'mcconkie said verse referred to jesus christ. verse goes' b'on to tell that he (christ) trusted in the "lord" who is called his' b'"god" or "elohim." mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is' b'"elohim" the father. verse however, reveals that the "elohim" of the' b'man jesus is "jehovah" the father.' b'' b'in ps. mcconkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses' b'will be considered in this examination.' b'' b'"yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom i trusted, which did eat of my' b'bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.' b'but thou, o lord [jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that' b'i may requite them. (ps. b'' b"mcconkie stated above that verse referred to judas' role in" b'christ\'s death. since it was judas who was the "familiar friend" who' b'"lifted up his heel," the pronouns "mine," "i," "my," and "me" in verse' b'9 must refer to christ. notice that at the beginning of verse there' b'is a change of pronoun to "thou," which refers to the "lord" (jehovah).' b'then the pronouns "me" and "i" which refer to christ are used again.' b'that means christ was speaking to "jehovah" the father in these verses.' b'' b"another example involves mcconkie's following remark about ps." b'110:4.' b'' b'"one of the great messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of david,' b'says: "the lord hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for' b'ever after the order of melchizedek."

(ps. b'' b'does the "lord," which is "jehovah," refer to christ? if' b'mcconkie is right and jesus is "jehovah," but the father is not, then' b'the "lord" would have to refer to christ. but who, then, is the one' b'addressed as the "priest forever after the order of melchizedek?" the' b'bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ (heb. b'6:20; therefore, the "lord" (jehovah) in ps. is the father.' b'' b'another example involves isa. of these verses mcconkie' b'stated:' b'' b'"of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah, isaiah said...' b'the _lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....' b'it pleased the _lord_ to bruise him... (promised messiah, p. b'(emphasis added)' b'' b'mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to "the atoning' b'sacrifice of the future messiah." however, what he failed to mention is' b'that they also prove that the father is "jehovah." verse reads: "all' b'we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;' b'and the lord [jehovah] hath laid on him [christ] the iniquity of us' b'all," and verse reads: "yet it pleased the lord [jehovah] to bruise' b'him [christ]..."' b'' b'obviously the "lord" who laid on christ "the iniquity of us all"' b'and who bruised him is god the father who is called "jehovah" in these' b'verses.' b'' b'remember, mcconkie stated that "some sectarians even believe' b'that jehovah is the supreme deity," and that christ "came into' b'mortality" as his "only begotten" son. he called this concept' b'"misinformation" that is "untrue." to prove that it is mcconkie who is' b'misinformed and believing untruth, two scriptural references sam.' b'7:14; ps. will be examined. mcconkie stated the following regarding' b'these scriptures:' b'' b'"in the midst of a passage that is clearly messianic, the lord says of' b'the seed of david: "i will be his father, and he shall be my son." b'sam. in the second psalm, the whole of which is also clearly' b'messianic, occurs this statement: "thou art my son; this day have i' b'begotten thee." (ps. paul quotes both of these statements in' b'hebrews and says they are prophecies that christ would come as the' b'son of god.
