b'' b'' b'hi folks,' b'' b'i borrowed a vhs tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying' b'that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the' b'original. i found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different' b"processes. however, i've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so i don't" b"want to take the chance even it's small." b'' b'anyone has experience in this kind of self-destructing video tapes?' b'' b'thanks in advance.' b'' b'--' b'ka lun pang (a.k.a. andy) lost between frequency and time on the unit circle' b'dod#
