b'' b'substituting irony for brains, (bruce klopfenstein) said:' b'' b'' b" of *course* they left rbis off; we're comparing alomar the individual with" b' baerga the individual, so only individual stats count.' b'' b"i forgot. most runs are scored by players stealing home, so rbi don't" b'count for anything.' b'' b"uh, right. you also forgot that you can't get an rbi (barring a hr) with" b'nobody on base. what fraction of all runs come on solo hr?' b'' b'most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the' b'batter did something good. i use the phrase "happened to be" advisedly.' b'lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the' b'most ability to "turn it up a notch" in clutch/rbi/whatever situations, and' b"what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an" b'ability to any measurable extent. there are no clutch hitters. people who' b'tend to do things that *would* cause an rbi if there were somebody on base' b'end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by' b'being in position.' b'' b'my mistake.' b'' b'i agree.' b'' b'me, too... rbi are a worthless stat. of course, so is stolen bases because' b'sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. and of' b'course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases,' b'so batting average, slugging and obp out, too. hmmm... i guess homers would' b'not count then, either.' b'my point? rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. and no stat (or lack' b'of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. maybe no stat can tell me,' b'either, but some people are... i just know it!!! b'' b'ed o.' b'' b'' b''
