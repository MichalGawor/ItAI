b'' b'finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in' b'realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,' b'there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications' b'in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is' b'discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).' b'' b'it seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications' b'would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future' b'probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained. i can even imagine this' b'being found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to' b'until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.' b'' b'imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out' b'to be a drug dealer, you can listen to all their past drug deals. and' b'archive calls to/from suspected mafia members, potential terrorists,' b'radicals, etc. imagine the convenience for the police of being able to' b'get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the world trade center' b'bombers made in the past year.' b'' b'since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why' b"wouldn't it happen?" b''
