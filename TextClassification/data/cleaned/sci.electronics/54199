b'' b'' b'this has been an interesting thread to follow... and obviously this group' b"wasn't intended as a forum for the discussion of piracy... has anyone seen" b'any estimates of the lost revenue due to pirates? i was wondering if' b'piracy is more rampant in home or corporate computing environments. i would' b'tend to think that business environment "piracy" is the major contributor to' b'this form of lost revenue. so many companies will purchase a few copies of a' b'software package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they' b'owned a site-license! what do you guys think?'
