b'' b'' b'dear friend,' b' the risc means "reduced instruction set computer". the risc usually has' b'small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase' b'the clock rate to have a high performance. you can read some books about' b'computer architecture for more information about risc.' b'' b'hmm... not that i am an authority on risc but i clearly remember' b'reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large.' b'the difference is in addressing modes risc instruction sets are not' b'as orthogonal is cisc.' b'' b'--' b'+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+' b"| some people say it's fun, but i think it's very serious. b'+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+' b'' b"theoretically supposed to be reduced.... not any longer. that's why everyone" b'is arguing about risc v.s. cisc. personally, i think cisc will win out.' b'just take a look at the pentium! (not that i like intel architectures either,' b"but that's another story...)" b'' b'bye!' b'' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'brian "hojo" lee "hey, excuse me miss, could i have a .gif of you?"' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
