b'' b'' b'hi,' b'' b'i just bought a mitsumi cd-rom drive and a sb pro soundcard. the pin outs on' b'the cd-rom line-out and the sb pro cd-in are not the same. i am considering' b'taking the rca output jacks on the mitsumi interface card and routing them to' b'the line-in input on the sb pro. will this work with multi-media software' b'that uses the cd-rom and the sb pro or do i need to go to the cd-in pins on' b'the sb-pro.' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'john' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'| john manning opinions expressed are my own. b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
