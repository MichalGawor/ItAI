b'' b'' b'the atf agent interviewed on "street stories" reported that the raid was' b"ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the bd's) knew the atf was" b'coming. why?' b'' b'i believe this raid was ill planned because they only had days to plan it,' b'and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part' b'in the much larger political agenda of president clinton. i would even' b'suggest that the loss of atf agents is inconsequential in this the' b'context of his political agenda. it might even be beneficial to his agenda,' b'as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. further proof' b'might be that the atf denied their agents (street stories report) requests' b'for sufficient fire power.' b'' b'important dates:' b'feb 25th nj assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.' b'feb 28th compound in waco attacked.' b'' b'on feb. 25th the new jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon' b'ban in that state. it looked like it might be a tight vote, but the senate' b'in n.j. was going to vote to overturn the ban. it would not sit well to have' b'an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given clintons stated' b'agenda on gun control. i suspect clinton gave the order to get someone or some' b'group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially' b'at the incident in waco) to record the event for the tv audience. the agent' b'on "street stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get' b'ready fast", as "they know we are coming". i believe this attack continued,' b'even tho the probablility of failure was high, because it came from the top' b'down. after the n.j. assembly vote, the atf had a limited amount of time to' b'come up with something, and the wackos in waco fit the bill nicely.' b'' b'...rich' b'' b''
