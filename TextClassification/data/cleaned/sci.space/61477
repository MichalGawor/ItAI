b'' b'' b' if you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in' b' and of itself.' b'' b'i think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that' b'are spinoffs of the space program. that is the only way you can *prove*' b'its worth to *them* and they vote and pay taxes too. the continued' b'existence of the space program relies upon that money.' b'' b'i have to agree with ward. the problem with your approach is they add' b"up what you can reasonably claim as 'spin-offs', add up what's been" b'spent on space, and then come back with something like, "you spent $x' b"billion for that? wouldn't it be better just to spend the money on" b'direct research and forget all this space stuff? we could have got' b'all that stuff a *lot* cheaper that way. space is wasteful and' b'inefficient."' b'' b'then they cancel your funding and spend it studying mating rituals of' b'new guinea tribesmen or something.' b'' b'--' b'"insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live' b'in the real world." mary shafer, nasa ames dryden' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
