b'' b'hello motif world,' b'' b'a few days ago i posted my announcement for an update of motif++. i got' b'several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and i know of several people' b'who have been using motif++, and there are probably a number of people i am' b'not aware of who are also using motif++.' b'' b'my question is:' b'' b"how many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where" b'people can ask questions about motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about' b'new directions and improvements for the bindings. this would benefit the' b'user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to' b'see added to motif++. motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this' b'way i can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or' b'changed.' b'' b"if you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to" b'reply to this message, and tell me so. when there is sufficient interest, say' b'about people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and i will' b'post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.' b'--' b'ronald van loon in theory, there is no difference' b'3dcv group, utrecht b'the netherlands in practice however, there is.'
