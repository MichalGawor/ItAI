b'' b'you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational' b'prices.' b'' b'i would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices!' b'i went for a retailer, actually mail order (cda computers), because its price' b'was better thant the campus computer store. i found out why later on when i' b'tried to get a repair done at an apple registered repair center the cpu was a' b'resale. the serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard' b'number (probably from cda computers). consequently, the apple repair man could' b'not do any warrenty repairs. so i ended up with just a 90day warrenty from cda' b'over the apple 12month warrenty. boy, was i pi**ed! moral of the story, caveat' b'emptor.' b'' b'however, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist' b'- maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably' b'get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order' b'out of state does not require sales tax yet. though for how much longer remains' b'to be seen. the addition in sales tax on a cpu purchase will probably wipe out' b'an educational discount. again caveat emptor, some mail order companies do' b'include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!' b'' b'richard.' b'/o o\\ washington state university' b'( voice fax b'\\_o_/ "to err is human, but to really screw things up takes a computer!"'
