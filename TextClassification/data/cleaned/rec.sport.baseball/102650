b'' b'' b'i totally agree with each point you made. jose viscaino looked' b'like a single a hitter up there. who swings on count with maddux' b"pitching and your teams down by a run, and you haven't touched the ball all" b'day. i also think too much is made of that lefty-righty thing. watching' b'the cubs games i get the feeling steve stone knows a lot more about what' b'the cubs should be doing than lefebre does. harry said it best when he' b"stated after another terrible vizcaino at bat-- we can't wait til" b'sandberg returns!'
