b'' b'the origional bit is missing but long/short follows:' b'' b'the origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga' b'monitor with a centris (hence title).' b'' b'the answer ot this question is an unqualified yes. you can use any' b'old vga/svga monitor with a centris. you do need an adaptor (i use a' b'mac vga-q from james engineering to run between the two' b'machines. the adaptor i have mentioned will convert a centris to a' b'three row vga/svga pin adaptor for your monitor.' b'' b'now, the special interest disclaimer.' b'the above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400' b'resolution. if your monitor will sync to 56khz horizontal the above' b'adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (i prefer this on my' b'1604s).' b'' b'then you have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates. i would' b'advocate calling james engineering because they seem to have a clue. as' b"to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling apple because" b'they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.' b'apple will treat you like a f**king assanine idiot for even' b'considering going third party and if you want this treatment wants you' b'to pay for their thech support line (the supposedly compitantly one) and' b'then still has no fu***** clue.' b'' b'personal experience. also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers' b"doesn't see to extend to macs (sony, magnavox). in addition to this to" b'find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the' b'sync rates elsewhere as ads like hardware that fits' b'(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most' b'favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a' b'specialized application video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolution' b'1168x832 on this "super smelly sock" monitor that will let you' b'display two full pages side by side. all you need is our reasonably' b'priced "oder eater" video board for and it will give you an' b'ultra fast horizontal sync rate of six fast kilohertz and three khz' b'vertical.")' b'' b'' b'' b'note: with the sony at least on the centris built in video' b'board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch to the' b'sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as' b'possible. using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an' b'inch.' b'' b'-a.'
