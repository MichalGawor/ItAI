b'' b'i am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing' b'3-d interactive applications what types of 3-d widgets you would' b'like to have in your applications.' b'' b'a 3-d widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-d objects of the' b'application. it may let you' b'' b'- manipulate application data, the camera,' b'3-d objects in the scene and so on, or' b'- view the status of the application or 3-d objects' b"via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or" b'- do whatever i missed but you think is possible.' b'' b'for example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a' b'partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.' b'a feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to objects. the length' b'of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the' b'ruler indicating the distance. a widget can provide both manipulation and' b'feedback. for example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between' b'the objects along its own axis.' b'' b'' b'please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-d interaction. the information' b'i gathered will help me design a 3-d ui construction tool.' b'your help is very much appreciated.' b'' b'tony lau' b'm.sc. student' b'dept. of computer science' b''
