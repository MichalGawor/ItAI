b'' b':' b': as a private citizen, i would feel much more "secure in my person and' b': papers" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil' b': liberties- the aclu and the nra come to mind- was safeguarding half of' b': my key. both the aclu and the nra are resistent to government pressure' b': by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or' b': overtly controlled by the government.' b': b'thats one problem that has so far been overlooked. these two escrow' b'agencies will have to create a secure database and service the' b'input and output of keys. who pays for this? if they refuse an' b'illegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can their' b'budget by cut to punish them? will congress be forced to fund' b'them forever?' b'' b'the problem is that laws can change. congress may pass a law setting' b'up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private. some' b'future congress may change that law. suppose pre-nazi germany had' b'a clipper system. do you think the escrow agencies would have' b'told hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid' b'court order?' b'' b'in effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of' b'the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance.' b'they will be able to directly tap into federal funds with no' b'accountability to anyone except through a court challenge.' b'' b'john eaton' b'!hp-vcd!johne' b'' b''
