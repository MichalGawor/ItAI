b'' b'' b' i recall reading in michael rutherford\'s novel "sarum" a scene in' b' which the son of a roman nobleman living in britain takes part in a' b' secret ceremony involving a bull. he stands naked in a pit covered' b' with some sort of scaffolding while assistants coax a bull to stand on' b' the scaffolding. they then fatally stab the bull, which douses the' b' worshipper in the pit with blood. this is supposedly some sort of' b' rite of passage for members of the bull cult. i wonder if this is' b' related to the mithras cult?' b'' b'yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the mithraic' b'cult (although not the only one.) it had many elements that seem' b'to have been borrowed by catholicism (e.g. the mass, communion, the' b'sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)' b'' b'for quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:' b'' b'the covenant of the flame' b'by david morrell.' b'' b'it has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing.' b"i won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but i will say that it" b'is relevant to mithraism.' b'--' b'home office in vienna, austria' b'** if you read news with rn or trn, ask me about eep! the .newsrc editor!'
