b'' b'' b'about people so far have asked, "once the fbi gets your clipper keys,' b'won\'t they be able to read all your future and past traffic?"' b'' b'there has been no response from nist, nsa, ms. denning, mr. hellman, or' b'anyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer.' b'this is troubling.' b'' b'it was implied in the first technical posting by dorothy denning that the' b"fbi would do the decryption *for* the law enforcement agencies. it wasn't" b'clear to me from the post whether this would be done in realtime or not, or' b'whether the fbi would just decrypt the session keys for the locals, or would' b'do the whole message.' b'' b"one thing i'm a bit puzzled by: why aren't they doing this with a public" b'key scheme of some sort? you could generate two uniqe public/private pairsor' b'for each chip. then, escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies. set' b'the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys. to decrypt' b'a message, both escrow agencies (in the right order, for most pk schemes)' b"have to decrypt with the escrowed private key. this way, there wouldn't be" b'thecconcern that, once the police had asked fo a warrant/wiretap, they' b'would have your key forver.' b'' b'--john kelsey'
