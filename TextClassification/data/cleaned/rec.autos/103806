b'' b'i also experience this kinda problem in my bmw during cold' b'start ups, the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out, for' b'about 5km, the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress' b'the clutch, the whole chassis moves along. but after preheating, it' b'becomes smooth again. i think that your suggestion of being some' b'humudity is right but there should be some remedy. i also found out that' b'my clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more!' b''
