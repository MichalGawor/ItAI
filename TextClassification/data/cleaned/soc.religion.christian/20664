b'' b'at the end of a recent (mon apr post, alastair thomson' b'offers the following "paraphrase" of john b'' b'"god loved the world so much, that he gave us his son,' b'to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life."' b'' b'the "to die in our place" bothers me, since it inserts into the' b'verse a doctrine not found in the original. moreover, i suspect that' b'the poster intends to affirm, not merely substitution, but forensic' b'(or penal) substitution. i maintain that the scriptures in speaking' b'of the atonement teach a doctrine of substitution, but not one of' b'forensic substitution.' b'' b'those interested in pursuing the matter are invited to send for my' b'essays on genesis, either thru (on this question) or through b"(with lead-in). the n'th essay can be obtained by sending to" b'message' b'get gen0n ruff' b'' b'yours,' b'james kiefer' b'' b'"any theologian worth his salt can put anything he wants to say in' b'the form of a commentary on the book of genesis" walter kaufman.'
