b'' b'we have an old sun3/60 here which gets occasional use. when x11r5 is started' b'on it any console messages during startup are undeletable. after x is fully' b'started we run an xterm as the "console" the problem is that any messages' b'that arrive before this starts go to the plain console. "refresh window" fails' b'to remove them. the messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of' b'the screen obscuring anything else below them.' b'' b'at boot time the lists two framebuffers /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.' b"we're running x in color, and i suspect that maybe the offending messages are" b'on the b/w framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.' b'' b'my question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid' b'of these messages?' b'' b'' b'hugh mcintyre.' b'inmos ltd., bristol, uk.' b'' b'(btw: sunos x11r5, mwm).' b'' b"ps: i know i can redirect output of the relevant commands to /dev/null i'm" b'looking for a more general solution).'
