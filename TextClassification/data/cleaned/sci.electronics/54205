b'' b'having vainly looked for devices capable of dealing to the nec 77p20' b'dsp chip which dont require taking out a mortgage, i decided to roll' b'my own. not a difficult task for an given that all the timing' b'relationships are set out in the databook. one thing bothers me, that' b'is the accursed 50ms volt vpp pulse. sure, a little buck step-up' b'converter can achieve this (in what is otherwise an all volt widget)' b'but i know latterday eproms dont need nearly this pulse length.' b'q has anyone come up with a more efficient programming algorithm' b'which is failsafe b'cheers' b'mike.'
