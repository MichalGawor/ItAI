b'' b'' b' i have seen the existance of electronics solder with a silver' b'content that seems to have good wetting and fatique reatings.' b' can anyone tell me why it is not used? (silver is not such an expensive' b'metal).' b'' b'this is called silver bearing solder. it is used to solder to' b'devices that have silvered contacts. one application is soldering' b'to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old tektronix scopes. these' b'were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.' b'if you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver' b'off of the ceramic. the silver was quite thin. the is a saturated' b'solution of silver in tin and lead. thus, no more silver can be' b'disolved in the solder solution. other devices that use silver contacts' b'are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.' b'--' b'well, that about says it.'
