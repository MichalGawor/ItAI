b'' b'' b'' b' peter,' b'' b' i believe this is your most succinct post to date. since you have nothing' b" to say, you say nothing! it's brilliant. did you think of this all by" b' yourself?' b'' b' -marc' b' b' b' some people are so narrow minded they can see through a crack in a door with' b' both eyes.' b' my opinions should be yours. my employer has no opinions.' b' b'' b'an open letter to marc afifi' b'' b'' b'dear marc,' b'i believe that you are wrong about mr. freeman. he has written in' b"a style that raises the level of posts on this board. if you just don't seem" b'to get it, i believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities' b'than of him. his posts contain substance and and he defends his positions' b'well.' b'having said this, i would like to ask in general for people on this' b"board to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack" b'the author of the posts. when one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the' b'ability to make a coherent argument concerning the post.' b'' b'peace,' b'' b'' b'danny' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
