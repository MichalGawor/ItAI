b'' b'' b"i'm considering switching to geico insurance, but have heard that" b'they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim. i was' b'worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim. i have' b'also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident.' b'' b"i've read in this group that geico has funded the purchasing of radar" b"guns by police depts (i'm not sure where)." b'' b'' b'geico has purchased radar guns in several states, i know they have done' b'it here in ct.' b'' b'i have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by geico' b'for years and then had accident and were immediately dropped. and once' b"you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high" b'risk, and end up forking out or times what you should be for insurance.' b'' b'this must vary from state to state, because our old company kemper wanted' b'to drop me (keeping my wife) or tripple our premium because i had ticket.' b'only points for mph over speed limit. well i called geico, and they' b'insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying' b'kemper.' b'' b'generally i hate the whole insurance game. i realize that it is necessary' b"but the way that a person can get dicked around doesn't make any sense." b'' b'one good thing about geico is that everything can be handled over' b'the phone.' b'' b'' b'' b'my suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but stay away from geico!' b'' b'jeff' b'' b'' b'' b'.' b'/' b'larry b'_____ b'----------- b'/ b'| b'/___ ====oo' b'\\ b'- 16v b'' b'' b'---------------- fahrvergnugen forever! b'the fact that i need to explain it to you indicates' b"that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!" b'------------------------------------------------------------' b''
