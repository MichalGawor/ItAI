b'' b'a few of us are touring sothwest utah in mid june to see the canyons.\\' b'do any of you have some helpful hints on where to stay or' b'things to see/do/avoid. plans are to see bryce, zion, arches.' b'is the grand close at that point or is an additional trip required?' b'any help would be nice. thank you for your support.' b'' b'--' b'no, the grand canyon is not too far away. short side trips to kolob' b'(between cedar city and hurricane) and pipe springs (on the way from' b'hurricane to the grand canyon) may be interesting--they are right' b'off the highway. pipe springs (a small fort) gives you real insight' b'into just how the pioneers lived. you have missed one major must' b'see attraction--cedar breaks in the mountains above cedar city.' b'take lots of film--they have a reason for calling this kodachrome' b'country. natural bridges in the four corners area is also very' b'scenic, but may be too far off your route. monument valley is' b'spectacular, but again may be too far away.' b'' b'rich tweedie' b''
