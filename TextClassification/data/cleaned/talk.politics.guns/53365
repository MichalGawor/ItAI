b'' b'|' b'| swatikas were also common in american indian markings/painted walls etc. is' b'| it the swastika that is bad?' b'|' b'| just want to back this up with a personal anecdote. my grandparents' b"| have a navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade" b'| from the weaver while living in flagstaff, arizona. the decorative motif' b"| consists of large black swastikas, one in each corner. what's more, the" b'| color scheme is black, white, and red. to the casual glance it would' b'| undoubtedly appear to be a nazi relic of some kind. yet they owned it' b'| ten years before hitler and the national socialists came to power.' b'|' b"| as i recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right" b"| about putting it back up until the 60's. it still draws comments from" b"| those who don't know what it is." b'' b'having lived, played, and worked on and near the navajo reservation' b'for a number of years, i can confirm this is an ancient pattern,' b'found in petroglyphs dated to years old.' b'' b'also, the indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern they' b"just stopped selling them after the nazi's pre-empted the swastika." b'' b'note also that the indian versions use both clockwise and' b'counter-clockwise swastikas.' b'' b"ob guns: it's the rare navaho family that doesn't own a rifle." b'they remember being "relocated" by the us army, and don\'t intend to' b'do it again. the hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for' b'weapons, from my experience. perhaps they just hide them better' b'from strangers.' b'' b'--' b'kirk hays nra life, seventh generation.' b'"the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to' b'do nothing." edmund burke
