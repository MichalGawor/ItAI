b'===============================================' b'' b'' b'the ahmadiyya movement in islam, an international organi-' b'sation, was found in in qadian, india. the founder of this' b'movement, hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad was proclaimed to' b'be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in the scriptures' b'of almost all major religions of the world. he claimed to be the' b'fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of jesus christ' b'(metaphorically), the muslim mahdi, and the promised messiah.' b'' b'the claims of hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and' b'extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of' b'divine reformers. even today this sect is being persecuted especial-' b'ly in some of the muslim regimes. the right of ahmadi muslims to' b'openly practice their religion and to define themselves as muslims' b'has been severely restricted in many muslim countries. the united' b'nations, human rights organizations such as amnesty international' b'and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns' b'against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the' b'members of this movement, but so far to no avail.' b'' b'despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-' b'inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the' b'world in over countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-' b'tural backgrounds.' b'' b'the movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards' b'developing a better understanding of all religions. ahmadi muslims' b'have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-' b'gious intolerance and fundamentalism.' b'' b'among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-' b'tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics' b'in many third world countries. these institutions are staffed by' b"volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's" b'internal resources. the movement stresses the importance of educa-' b'tion and leadership. its members have included a high number of' b'professionals as well as world class individuals.' b'' b'the ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral' b'reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under' b'one universal brotherhood.' b'' b'' b'newsgroup creation:' b'==================' b'' b'the discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-' b'cially ended. voting will be held for three weeks. if the news-' b'group gets 2/3rd majority and more "yes/create" votes than' b'"no/don\'t create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created.' b'' b'' b'about the vote-taker:' b'====================' b'' b'mr. anthony lest has been asked by the proponents of' b'this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the' b'proposed newsgroup. he has no objection to use his workstation' b'for the purpose of vote-taking. neither the university of colora-' b'do, nor anthony lest has anything to do with the proposal of the' b'newsgroup. they are just collecting the votes as a neutral third' b'party.' b'' b'questions or comments:' b'=====================' b'' b'any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup' b'may be sent to:' b'' b'any questions or problems in voting should be sent to:'
