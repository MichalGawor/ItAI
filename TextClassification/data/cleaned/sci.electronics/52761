b'' b'' b"\tif you know much about pc's (ibm comp) you might try the joystick" b"port. though i haven't tried this myself, i've been told that the port" b'has built in a-d converters. this would allow the joystick to be a couple of' b'pots. if you could find the specs this might just work for you...' b'' b'i believe that the "a-d converters" found on a joystick port are really' b'timers that tick off how long it takes an r-c circuit (the r being your' b'paddle) to charge up to something like vcc. for games this works' b"pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab" b'measurements off something as non-linear as that.' b'' b'hmm... i suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem' b'is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher' b'voltages would be more precise).' b'' b'on the other hand, i could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers' b'splurged for the extra to make a cheap constant current source out of' b"an op amp. but i wouldn't expect that..." b'' b'---joel kolstad'
