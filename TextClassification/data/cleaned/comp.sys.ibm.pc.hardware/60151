b'' b'i was recently loaned an older dec at work, and i have the option' b'of adding an additional western digital hard-drive to the machine. the' b'existing drive is currently a western digital as well, and is working fine,' b'but i do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave' b'relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.' b'' b'the first drive is currently formatted to tandy dos v3.3 but i am eventually' b'going to upgrade both to ms dos v b'' b'the drives themselves are both model number wd95044-a circa b'they are cyl head drives. a note to add is that there is no exact' b'configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a' b'setting cyl head, write_pre, landing zone).' b'there are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that i presume are' b'for setting up the master/slave. originally, the drive in the machine' b'had none. currently, i was suggested to try the far right (looking at the' b'back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.' b'' b'when booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive. it does' b'flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.' b'hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not' b'being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, i' b'would not even know how to do that.' b'' b'any and all help on this is great fully appreciated. if not, a number' b'for western digital might just do as good!' b'' b'swood' b'' b'--' b"hunting over in michigan? don't despair no closed season on:" b'opossum, porcupine, weasel, red squirrel, skunk, starlings,' b'feral pigeons, english sparrows, ground squirrel woodchuck' b'anyway trout season opens the last saturday this month.'
