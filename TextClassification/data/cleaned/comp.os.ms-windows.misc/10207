b'' b"i'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs. a" b"couple of issues ago, pc mag listed as editor's choices both conversion" b'artist and hijaak for windows. anyone have any experience with those or' b"some others? i'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, and" b"i'm not making much progress with the screen shots. b'' b"i'm currently using dodot and i'm about to burn it and the disks it rode" b"it on. it's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving" b'me crazy. tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a' b"tiff file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left" b'and right sides of the picture usually it confines itself to not' b'copying things to the clipboard (so i have to save and load pix for' b'editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.' b'' b'the one nice thing it has, though, is it\'s "dither" option. you\'d think' b'that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say,' b'256 colors to colors. but if you go from or colors to b&w,' b'you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which' b'turn to white. for me, this is useful because i can turn light grays on' b'buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the' b'3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window.' b'' b'if you understood my description can you tell me if another (less' b'buggy!) program can do this as well?' b'' b'much thanks for any help.' b'' b'---------------------------------signature---------------------------------' b'david delgreco "what lies behind us and what lies' b'technically a writer before us are tiny matters compared' b'| oliver wendell holmes' b'--'
