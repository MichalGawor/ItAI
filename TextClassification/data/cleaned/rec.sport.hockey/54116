b'' b"espn is pathetic, i have been watching everybody complain about espn's coverage" b'and i agree with all of you. might i suggest that we are getting all worked up' b"over nothing. we all knew that espn's coverage was going to suck. i mean have" b'you ever watched during the regular season sportscenter coverage of hockey? it' b'sucks, i mean really sucks!!! espn does not know hockey if it shot them in the' b'ass. i was really pissed of about last night, coverage. i go to school in ohio' b'i *know* the indians suck, so why show them? if i were bill clement i would' b'shoot myself.' b'' b'anyway after i calmed down after i realized that they were not going to show' b'overtime of the caps isles game i thought to myself i knew that this was going' b'to happen, in fact i remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even' b'the boring devils game.' b'' b'overall i think espn does not care if they show hockey or not and i firmly' b'belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract' b'obligations*, screw you espn.' b'' b'praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit!' b'' b'go hawks!!!' b'' b'jb'
