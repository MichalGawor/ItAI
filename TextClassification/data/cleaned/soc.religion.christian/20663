b'' b'on the question, "does god hear the prayers of sinners?" we need to' b'distinguish.' b'' b'if we say that he never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we' b'make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than centuries' b'ago.' b'' b'but if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone' b'who says, "lord, i want you to do this for me, but don\'t expect me' b'to change my way of life," that is a different matter. even here, i' b'would not venture to say that god never grants such petitions (just' b'as he sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good). however, if' b'someone we know well is praying to god in that spirit, we might have' b'the responsibility to say, "remember, if god\'s help is real, then so' b'are his commands."' b'' b'yours,' b'james kiefer'
