b'' b"| i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif, but i'm hoping" b'| is really just a mistake on my part. does anyone know anything about' b'| this problem........' b'|' b'| i am using an xmtextfield, and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded' b'| text string (ascii or kanji) either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring.' b'| the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed, the text is getting' b'| truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables' b'| lang (more specifically lc_all). when they are set to japanese,' b'| the text gets truncated. when they are set to english, everything' b'| works fine. i am taking the default for xmncolumns.' b'| (please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual' b'| application, just in my sample code to make things easier)' b'|' b'| i am running motif x11r5 via hpux9.01. my test program is set up' b'| to handle bit kanji characters. i have remembered to do' b'| xtsetlanguageproc() prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources' b'| are set to japanese fonts.' b'|' b"| don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and textfield is initially" b'| created with uil.' b'|' b'|' b'| the problem does not happen with xmtext. unfortunately substituting' b'| xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable' b'| alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)' b'|' b'| i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone' b'| wants it. my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not' b"| properly allocating memory for japanese, but since i don't have the" b'| source to look at it is just a guess.' b'' b'the problem was that textfield was improperly walking the string; it used' b'the character count instead of the byte count... a significan "oops".' b'the problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic' b'patch from hp support services.' b'' b'tom mcfarland'
