b'' b" actually, i must also ask the faq's most popular reason why graphics" b" don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your" b' rectangle?' b'' b'suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains' b'xlib graphics. a button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item' b'to be drawn in the window. this action clearly should not call xcopyarea()' b'(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new' b'item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care' b'of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the' b'window is mapped.' b'' b'the problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window' b'is visible and mapped. do you know the best way to "tickle" a window so' b'that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?' b'' b'' b'what does this have to do with my original question??? i previously' b'stated that i did an xcopyarea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen' b'just to make sure that my image had data, and it did. this is not' b'a problem with expose events, it has to do with xcopyplane not' b'working!!!' b'' b'does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that' b'xcopyplane works??? this would be very helpful!' b'' b'thanks!' b'' b'----------------------------------------------------------------' b'ensco inc. mail: pineda ct. melbourne, fl. b'(407)254-4122 fax: b'----------------------------------------------------------------' b''
