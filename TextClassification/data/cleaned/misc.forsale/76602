b'' b'' b'computer equipment garage sale:' b'' b"i've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff" b"that is broken or not being used by me. i've put together a list and" b'indicated what i think each item is worth. this is just my estimate, and i' b"am very open to any offers, including trades. i'm currently looking for" b'some cd-roms that will work with a mac cd rom player cd caddies, hd floppy' b'disks, any used macintosh software, a 387-33mhz co-processor, or basically' b"anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)" b'make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked...' b'i really want to get rid of this stuff...' b'' b"ok, here's the list:" b'' b'52 meg scsi hard drive. conner model #cp-3150. i bought this from a guy' b"at a swap meet to use with my macintosh. unfortunately, i can't seem" b'to get it to work with the scsi controller in my computer. the' b'guy tested it with his pc, and printed out a copy of the norton disk' b"doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (i'll send you a copy)" b"i was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so i can't return it to" b"him. the drive has many jumpers on it, (which i don't know how to set)" b"so maybe that's the problem. i was quite disappointed that it didn't" b"work so i'm trying to minimize my losses.\t~$45" b'' b'52 meg scsi hard drive. conner model #cp-3150. same situation as above.' b'i bought both of these drives from the same guy. despite the different' b'model numbers they are the same exact drive. same report from ndd' b'(i have one for each drive) will be included.\t~$45' b'' b'40 meg sony scsi hard drive. sony model #srd2040a. the drive mechanism' b'is completely trashed. this hard drive was in my computer (mac se) and' b'had a stiction problem. well, repeated banging on the side of the' b'computer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which' b'was not too pleasant to listen to. still the scsi controller' b'card is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a' b'project.\t~$20' b'' b'65 meg seagate hh scsi hard drive. model #st-277n. i originally bought' b'this drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and i though that' b'i could fix it. well i determined that the drive mechanism was fine,' b"and that it was a controller problem. (motor controller wasn't sending" b'proper signals.) well, after taking the controller off the drive,' b'looking at it, and putting it back together, i realized that i' b'accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the' b"drive to the controller. i tried to solder it, but i'm not that good" b"at soldering so i couldn't do it. worked perfectly before i messed" b'up. i used it as a temporary drive when the sony (above) crashed on' b'me. also loaded the drive with about twenty mac applications,' b'worth well over (claris cad, ms word think c,' b'excel, and many others)' b'i think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable. you also get all' b'the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate) i only' b'ask that you delete my data files from the drive. i was really angry' b"when i broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it. i just don't" b'have time to play with it any more.\t~$65' b'' b'at&t isdn modem. this is for use on digital phone systems. if you know' b'what this is or would like technical information on it, let me know. i' b'have some tech documents on it. is supposed to be the same thing as an' b'at&t digital phone, but without the phone part. it seems to be in' b'working order (passes self test perfectly ok). i have no idea how' b"this is worth... let me know if you're interested." b'' b"motorola coprocessor. i haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone" b'is interested i will get it tested out, to make sure that it works. i' b'had trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then i spoke to the' b"manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without" b'another controller chip. when i was looking around to buy one new, the' b'prices were around i will guarantee this to work.\t~$65' b'' b"cga card. half-length. 8-bit. wasn't working last time i checked (although" b'i think i was using a bad monitor)\t~$5' b'' b'5.25"\t360k floppy drive. ibm drive type guaranteed to work,' b'because when i took it out of the pc, it was working!\t\t~$25' b'' b'5.25" 360k floppy drive. toshiba model number nd-08de-a. guaranteed to' b'work. came out of same pc as above.\t~$25' b'' b'5.25"\tfloppy drives. can\'t guarantee that these will work. i don\'t' b"even know if they are low or high density drives. i don't have" b'any method of testing them.' b"panasonic model number: ju-455-5 acg. there's another" b'number on it: b"panasonic model number: ju-475-2 agg. there's also" b'another number on it: h3649-101457' b'toshiba model number nd-08de. virtually identical to the one' b'above.' b'each drive b'' b'3.5" ps/2 drive. these things are proprietary, so i can\'t test it, but i' b"think it works. not sure if it's high density or low density, but i" b'suppose someone who is looking for one would know. model number' b'dfl413c04a. i think these things are expensive to replace. b'' b"mfm hard drive controller cards. i've got three of these, and i have no way" b'of testing them. two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit' b'card with a floppy controller built in.\t~$10 for the 8-bits for' b'the 16-bit card w/floppy.' b'' b'interesting cable. seems to convert from a vga plug to an ega plug. that is,' b'standard nine-pin to vga pin. made by hewlett packard. part no.' b'd1181-80020\t\t~$10' b'' b'' b'' b"i've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many" b"satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore. i" b"usually ship through the u.s. postal service (haven't had any problems yet)" b'and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.' b'' b"well, that's all folks. as i said before, no offer will be refused. if you" b'can convince me to give ocit to you instead of throwing it out, try! i hate' b'to throw away stuff...' b'' b'' b'-wayne' b'' b'(617)-225-9349' b'' b'' b''
