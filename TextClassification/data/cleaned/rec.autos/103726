b'' b"i don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem." b'unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight' b"fluid. follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight. some of the" b'cars i have had (all standard transmissions or speeds) recommend' b'changing the transmission fluid at miles under normal driving' b"conditions. i've gone without changing the transmission oil (and" b'had to replace the transmission bearings!). my older cars used weight' b'oil whereas my honda uses motor oil (or maybe weight).'
