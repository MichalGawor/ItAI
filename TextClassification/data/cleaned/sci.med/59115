b'' b'i experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning. just after' b'i completed my 4th set of deep squats. today was my weight training' b'day and i was just beginning my routine. all of a sudden at the end of' b'the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep. it was cold, turned pale,' b"and lost of its strength. the weight i used for squats wasn't that" b'heavy, i was working hard but not at effort. i waited for a few' b'minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with' b'chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than i normally use. but' b'i dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued' b'arm weakness into the second. so i quit training and decided not to do my' b"usual hour on the ski machine either. i'll take it easy for the rest of" b'the day.' b'' b'my arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal b'my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. color has returned to normal' b'and it is no longer cold.' b'' b'horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through' b"my brain. i'm vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise" b"regimen. so that can't be it. could a pinched nerve from the bar" b'cause these symptoms (i hope)?' b'' b'it likely has nothing to do with "chunks of plaque" but it sounds like' b'you may have a neurovascular compromise to your arm and you need medical' b'attention *before* doing any more weight lifting.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'gordon banks n3jxp "skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
