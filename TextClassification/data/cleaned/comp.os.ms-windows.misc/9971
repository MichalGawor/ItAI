b'' b'' b'i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse.com (was using b'i think, but switched to to see if it was any better). vertical motion' b"is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can't click" b'on something because my mouse jumps around. i can be moving the mouse to' b'the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly' b'for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump' b'again (maybe this time to the left about inch!). this is crazy! i have' b'never had so much trouble with a mouse before. anyone have any solutions?' b'' b'try this: flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the' b'mouse ball in place. remove the ball, and inside you should see' b'(probably) rollers. if any of the rollers have a tiny layer of' b'caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully' b'scrape it off with a small knife (xacto works great). *be careful*' b'you do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.' b'put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.' b'' b'i clean a couple of dozen of these every month here. another symptom' b'is that when you move the mouse, it seems to "click" along. if this' b"doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse. i highly" b'recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,' b"place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep" b'the dust off.' b'' b'personally i prefer track balls. oh, which brings me to another point:' b'if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is' b'streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice' b'that it will stop working. if this happens to you, close the curtains' b'or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.' b'' b'--' b'peter goudswaard b'| b'"there\'s no gift like the present" b"- goudswaard's observation
