b'' b' my boss is considering the purchase of a powerbook or duo. he is leaning' b' towards a because of the math coprocessor (for mathematica), but would' b' get a duo if he could find a mini-dock with a coprocessor. have any' b' third-parties announced such a beast?' b'' b' i believe that e-machines might produce something of this nature.' b'' b'' b'yes, e-machines makes two mini-docks--the powerlink presente and the' b'powerlink desknet. the presenter offers a variety of video-out options,' b'including ntsc, rgb and svga. it also has sound out, floppy drive port' b'and a power port. unfortunately no scsi port and it blocks the serial port.' b'the desknet has the standard ports plus built-in ethernet. alas, none of' b'these have an fpu.' b'in the future, rasterops is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes' b'me now. it is supposed to support 16-bit color and "quadra" comparable' b'video speed. no idea if it has an fpu.' b'hope this helps...' b'' b'beth corbo'
