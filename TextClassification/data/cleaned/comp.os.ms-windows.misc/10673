b'' b'for the most part, this newsgroup is "attack" oriented. microsoft has been' b'attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the' b'intelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc. anyone' b'would get defensive when being baselessly attacked. we are human beings as' b'well. you should expect a response when a claim that an employee might' b'feel is unwarranted is leveled.' b'' b'ignore the attacks and look at the sales numbers and the ms' b'stock price if you need some' b'gratification. just keep doing the great job you have done in the past.' b'thx dave l' b'' b''
