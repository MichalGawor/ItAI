b'' b"you'd need to launch hlvs to send up large amounts of stuff. do you know" b'of a private titan pad?' b'nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy titans. it' b"doesn't take many titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large" b'gas gun or a development program for a big dumb booster, all of which' b'would have far better cost-effectiveness.' b'' b'henry, i made the assumption that he who gets there firstest with the mostest' b'wins.' b'' b"only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the" b'prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort. you can' b'spend a billion pretty quickly buying titan launches.' b'' b"what's more, if you buy titans, the prize money is your entire return on" b'investment. if you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and' b'the prize is just the icing on the cake.' b'' b'i doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough' b'return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current' b'us launchers. (there would surely be a buy-american clause in the rules' b'for such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.)' b"you're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch" b'system rather than pissing it away on existing ones. being there first is' b'of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it.' b'' b'... could i get a couple of canadarms tuned for the lunar environment? i' b"wanna do some teleoperated prospecting while i'm up there..." b'' b"i'm sure spar would offer to develop such a lunar-tuned system and deliver" b'a couple of them to you for only a couple of hundred million dollars.' b'--'
