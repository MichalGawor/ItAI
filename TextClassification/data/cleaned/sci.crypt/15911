b'' b": there are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion. they can't" b': be expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to pbxs or on the' b': pbx line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses' b': voice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased t1s or' b': satellite circuits.' b'' b": i can't remember the generic term for these chips. my impression is that" b': this was a big deal years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that' b": it isn't done much now." b'' b'codecs. they have to get about compression on bit samples to squeeze' b"them down v32bis. i played around with the lossless 'shorten' program" b"last night, but it only managed i've got some specimen celp code" b"but it's not obvious that it runs in real time; i think it's just proof-of-" b'concept code, and i have some mucking about with file formats to do before' b'i can put my own sample through it.' b'' b'looks like the current option is to use a voice-mail modem with built-in' b'dsp chip to do this in hardware. that means two modems for a system,' b"putting the cost at upwards. ouch. maybe soon we'll be able to" b"do it in software on high-powered games consoles isn't the 3do an" b'acorn risc machine inside? that cpu runs like shit off a shovel... and' b'will be nicely mass-market too.' b'' b'g'
