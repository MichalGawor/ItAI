b'' b'i have a .bat file that i run under a windows icon. i have set up a pif' b'file to run the bat file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen.' b'the first line of the bat file sets an environment variable.' b'' b'my problem is that on some of our machines (running ms-dos and windows' b'3.1 in enhanced mode), the set command in the bat file fails with the' b'out of environment space error. i have raised the amount of environment' b'space to bytes using the shell command in config.sys so i know that' b'i am nowhere near to running out. if i just click on the ms-dos icon,' b'i can create a bunch of environment varibles from the dos shell. the problem' b'is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in' b'a bat file fails. has anyone seen such behavior before? i see no place in the' b'pif fail to configure environment space.' b'' b'trw systems engineering development div. phone: b'carson, ca
