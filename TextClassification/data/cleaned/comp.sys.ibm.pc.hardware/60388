b'' b'i came upon this idea i would like to share with everyone.' b'' b'to check for bad memory chips' b'' b'1. create a boot disk with emm386 himem.sys and ramdrive.sys in the' b' config/autoexec.bat.' b'' b'2. boot the pc to create a ram drive as large as possible.' b'' b'3. use a disk repair utility i use ndd run it on the ram' b' drive, yes it will run, its only a device driver' b'' b'4. run or so passes, they go very quick' b'' b'5. if your machine fails, there is a definate bad memory chip' b'' b'6. if your machine passes, there is a conflict with programs you' b' are loading in memory.' b'...' b'' b"it's an interesting idea, but the worst-case data patterns developed to" b'test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect' b'common faults in memory chips.' b'' b'--' b'bob nichols' b'at&t bell laboratories'
