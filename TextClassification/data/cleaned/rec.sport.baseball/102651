b'' b'' b'\tusually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor' b'uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been' b'incredible.' b'\tany thoughts on the new (old) reds uniforms. i' b'remember seeing a pete rose rookie card, and unless i miss my' b'guess he was wearing the exact same duds.' b"\tthe mets (how about doc's performance today?!!!!!) have" b'reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the mets' b'insgnia on the front of the jersey. to my knowledge it is the' b'first time that has been changed since and it reminds me' b'a little of the dodger logo.' b'' b'as far as i know, toronto, pittsburgh, and new york (nl) change their' b'uniforms every year. every other year (e.g., new york), it will say mets' b'in cursive, new york in cursive, or new york in all caps. minor changes,' b'but they do change them often. last year, i think they had new york in all' b'caps. did toronto have blue jays or toronto last year? what about' b'pittsburgh?' b'' b'\tmany teams have opted for a return to a previous style' b'of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.' b'(phillies, reds, expos, white sox, padres, etc.) and the once' b'bright colors have been altered to gray. the trend has also' b'seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the' b'early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums' b'construcrted throughout the sixties.' b'' b'i hate the gray. they should opt for more color (like the white sox).' b'i hate white team versus gray team. spring training uniforms look much' b'better.' b'' b'\twith salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one' b"in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the" b"horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it" b'was meant to be.'
