b'' b'' b'i have read numerous posts over a period of several months, by' b'this anti-israel fanatic, hiding in the shadow of the respectable' b"sounding name of the 'center for policy research.' obviously, it" b"is no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published" b'documents to find material to use against israel makes it so.' b'' b'labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising' b'in itself. that is simply part of the propaganda process. i was' b'curious if anyone knew who this anti-israel fanatic hiding behind' b"his phoney 'research center' name is. is he an arab? is he some" b"typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?' is" b"he some jew who perhaps lived in israel and just couldn't make it" b'there, and is now taking his failure out on israel?' b'' b"let's shed some light on this clown once and for all. it will" b'help put his nonsense in the proper perspective. and the readers' b'of this group who are more interested in fact than in anti-israel' b'hyperbola can ignore this junk.' b''
