b'' b' to summarize:' b' while questioning the sagacity of someone who said they would' b' "rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven' b' knowing even one man would spend his "eternal life" being' b' scorched for his wrongdoings..." i described how horrible hell' b" is and compared the above statement with jesus'" b' suffering on the cross in order to prevent people going to hell.]' b'' b'which kenneth engel challenges:' b" did this happen to jesus? i don't think so, not from what i heard." b' he lived one day of suffering and died. if the wages of sin is' b" the above paragraph, then jesus didn't pay for our sins, did he?" b'' b'i will wimp out and admit that i never liked the metaphor of' b'jesus "paying" for our sins in the sense that many christians' b'accept as literal. the point is that god understands the suffering' b'we go through, not just intellectually like when we watch' b'the somalians on tv, but _really_ understands, he can "feel"' b"our pain. this fact is manifested by jesus' life. we can argue" b'that someone in history might have suffered more than jesus,' b'we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion, we can' b'think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to' b'worse despair, but the main point is that jesus is in the' b'trenches with us, he is in everyone, whatever i do to the least' b'of humanity i do to him, and whatever i do for the least of' b'humanity i do for him.' b'' b'now, to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my' b"capabilities, but that wasn't my goal." b'' b" i'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through," b'' b'thankfully our moderator is surprising.' b'' b' but i seriously want a reasonable explanation for this.' b'' b'as i re-read this i must admit that this is more of a description' b"of my faith than an explanation, but perhaps that's all" b"i can do, hopefully that's all i have to do." b'' b'chris mussack'
