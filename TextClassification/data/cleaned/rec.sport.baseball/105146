b'' b'i feel that talking about speeding up baseball games, is like trying' b'to keep signal to noise ratio high on rec.sports.baseball. no matter' b'how much you talk about it, or how reasonable your arguments, there' b'will always be people who quote an entire article (with signatures!)' b'to make a one line comment, reply or woof. whether through their' b'stupidity, denseness or excitement and overeagerness to bless us with' b'their insight, no matter what is said, they will always keep doing it.' b'' b'same with ballgames. no matter how much it might benefit the game for' b'the umpires to enforce the rules and for the players/managers/coaches' b"to stop wasting our time it just ain't gonna happen." b'' b'rudy.' b'' b'i agree.'
