b'' b'we`ve had the the great western, the dunno and the great northern' b'postulated as brunel`s masterpiece. keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll' b'get round to it eventually.' b'' b'the great western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,' b'with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. the great eastern, which broke' b"the 'little giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap" b'forward in ship design. a thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with' b'primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean' b'going vessel ever built. brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo' b'and or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose' b'with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles' b'without coaling.' b'' b'unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,' b'and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. as another poster' b'said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable' b'laying ship. it was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying' b'a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to' b'carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for' b'defective sections. see arthur c clarke`s book "how the world was one"' b'[ i think that`s right b'' b'if that`s how the shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph' b'and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely' b'ignoble, but i doubt if history will be so charitable. its true the' b'shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they' b'worth doing? with low cost access to space, you could have an' b'affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned' b'missions. as it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a' b'space-rv, only not so cheap to run b'--' b'__._____.___._____.__._______________________________________________________' b'__|_. peter card, joint european torus, abingdon' b'| oxfordshire ox14 3ea uk. tel fax b'._| it wasnt me. it was the others. they made me do it.' b"--`--~'-+---+-+-+----+-------------------------------------------------------" b'- disclaimer: please note that the above is a personal view and should not' b'be construed as an official comment from the jet project.'
