b'' b" one advanage of mit-shm is that if your images are large, you don't end up" b' growing the size of the server process to hold them.' b'' b'correct. most x servers use a version of malloc(3) which will not return' b'memory to the os (ie. the x server might free(3) a pixmap, but the heap does' b'not shrink).' b'' b' one disadvantage of the mit-shm is that, in its sample implementation,' b' there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments' b' if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., "kill"). you have to' b' be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.' b'' b'well, part of the routines i mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around' b'that problem. first, i create the shared memory segment, attach the client,' b'attach the x server, and then remove the segment. if you read the man' b'pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment' b'only dies after all attachments are gone.' b"now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the os cleans up for you)" b"and since the x server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources," b'including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. no more' b'shared memory segment.' b'terrible, but it works.' b'' b'regards,' b'' b'richard gooch....'
