b'' b'' b' when did *you* go out and change the laws of physics? according to some' b'numbers i used to see bandied around, shaft drive is on the order of b'efficient, while chain drive is closer to seems to me that this makes' b'*chain* drive more efficient, hmmmmm???' b'' b"well maintained chains, running in oil, without those little rubber 'o' rings" b'to cause frictional losses, might reach efficiency. the average open to' b"the dust 'o' ring motorcycle chain probably has a difficult job making b'efficient.' b'' b'how about some sources for all these numbers? or is this more stuff that' b'"everybody knows"?' b'--'
