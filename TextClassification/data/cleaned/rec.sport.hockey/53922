b'' b'' b'i loved the abc coverage. the production was excellent. the appearance' b'was excellent. it had a sleek modern look. this was the first time i heard' b'thorne clement i thought they were great. my only request is to leave' b'al micheals out of this. he annoys me.' b"i'm hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. my guess would" b'be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from feb.-april and then the' b"playoffs. i envy you canadians with your tsn cbc. maybe i'll get a dish" b'to pick up canadian tv. how much are those things, btw?'
