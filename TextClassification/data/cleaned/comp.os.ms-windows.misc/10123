b'' b' microsoft is the largest software company on the planet, yet i cannot' b' think of even *one* computing concept that they innovated and brought' b' to market before anyone else. xerox-parc/apple, osborne, next, gnu' b' and others have been pioneers and led the way to the future of' b' computing. what has microsoft done to be a technological leader? i' b' posted this question before, but i got nary a reply. i make the' b' challenge now to anyone who can come up with something-especially' b' microsoft employees. i get no response this time, i guess it pretty' b' much assures me that there is none--which is what i suspect anyway.' b'' b' really when you come down to it who cares. i just hope ms keeps doing' b' what they do best getting usable productive software to the masses.' b'' b"personally, i'll be blasphemous and say that if microsoft keeps doing" b'what it does so well, i hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright' b'and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and' b"other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. i'd hate to" b'be one who actually does innovate, and then have microsoft come in' b'like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff,' b"marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. i don't have all" b"that much sympathy for apple's complaint against microsoft, since" b"they just took the ideas from xerox's pa research center when the" b'federal government forced xerox to disclose their patents over' b'antitrust fears. however, for other companies and individuals who' b'have a great idea, yet get it "borrowed" by larger corporations who' b'can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from' b'the original innovator, i feel much sympathy.' b'' b'larry' b'--' b'larry weeks "those who fight monsters should make sure that' b'-------------------+ when you look long into an abyss the abyss also' b'looks into you." friedrich nietszche'
