b'' b'wrong about the whole guns-for-protection mindset, it ignores the' b'systemic effects of cumulative individual actions. if you want fire' b"insurance on your house that's prudent and it has no effect on me; but" b'if you and a bunch of other paranoids are packing handguns in the' b"backcountry it makes me, and anyone else who doesn't chose to protect" b'himself in this manner, pretty f**king nervous.' b'' b"why? if you're not a threat, you're not affected at all." b'' b'i mean, take this to its logical conclusion, suppose we all carried' b'handguns all the time, for protection from all the other people' b'carrying handguns. would we collectively be, or feel, safer? hell no.' b"we'd feel a lot more insecure." b'' b'why? i note that the available psych info says that feelings of' b'security increase. the victimization stats say that that increase' b'is rational.' b'' b'another systemic effect of all the "good" people protecting themselves' b'is that the "bad" people are going to modify their behavior in' b'response:' b'' b'yes, they are, but how?' b'' b"they're going to be much itchier and much more willing to" b'kill people in the course of routine muggings if they think their' b'' b"nope that doesn't happen. instead the switch (among those who" b"change behaviors) to property crimes. that's an improvement even if" b'the economic take is unchanged. sure not everyone switches, but' b'they were killing before.' b'' b'-andy' b'--'
