b'' b'' b'i would like to sell my dot matrix printer so i can upgrade to inkjet.' b'it is a "panasonic kx-p1124 pin multi-mode printer". here are the' b'stats (from memory and the manual):' b'' b'- 360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics, etc.' b'- very fast (up to cps) printing in "printer-controlled" (as' b'opposed to windows driver-controlled) printing' b'- bidirectional printing for faster processing speed' b'- fonts ("courier","prestige","bold ps","script","sans serif")' b'- epson lq-2500 and ibm proprinter x24 printer emulation' b'- can accept single sheets, envelopes, and non-carbon copies by' b'friction feed' b'- front or bottom paper feed' b'- 6kb buffer' b'' b'i will send a sample document and a printed gif/jpeg file to anyone' b'who wishes to send a sase. with purchase (prepaid, please!), i will' b'include the following accessories:' b'' b'- manual' b'- cable (centronics)' b'- remaining stack of tractor-fed paper (about b'- free copy of windows printer driver (unless this is illegal, or if' b'it is included with windows)' b'- free unregistered dos shareware program registration, i think)' b'that apparently offers some word processing capabilities' b'from dos' b'' b'the last two will be on a disk (either size). i am asking for around' b'$165, but i am open to any (reasonable) offers. i am a college' b'student, so i cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a' b'considerable portion of the money from this printer. this price' b'includes all above items, and shipping (probably ups) is included as' b'well. i have the original box, but only one of the original styrofoam' b'end pieces. i will use a towel on the other end (you get a free towel' b'too!!). worked fine getting it here. the whole shebang might not fit' b'in the original box; i will figure this out after the offers come in.' b'email any questions and offers.\t\t-jon.' b'--'
