b'' b'' b'\ti am the person who started out this subject.' b'' b'\tto me, the question really is not about dealer profit but the' b"\tamount of money for the type of car. i've settled with a" b'\tnew subaru wagon with the similar amount of money a saturn' b"\tdealer asked for a sw1. ok, i know it's a model, but i think" b'\ti got a better car (though i have to adjust my initial idea of' b'\twhy i am getting a new car).' b'' b'\ttoday, during a conversion with a friend, i learned he rejected' b'\ta saturn for a ford tarurs; as it only costed him a little bit more' b'\tthan a sl2. i may be wrong, but a loaded tarus beats a saturn sl2.' b'' b'i agree that a fully-loaded sl2 would come close in price to a' b'lower-end ford taurus. a fully-loaded taurus, on the other hand, would still' b'be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy sl2. a fully loaded' b'sl2 would run somewhere around while a fully loaded taurus lx would be' b'somewhere around the range. a base taurus (gl i believe) might' b'start around of course there is the taurus sho which can push b'if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream' b'taurus sedan. your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little' b'inaccurate.' b'' b'' b"\ti can't see saturn is of better value and that is why i was puzzled" b'\tby its pricings. oh, we did not spend much time getting our deals;' b'\tbeing better informed has its advantages.' b'' b"well, that's ok. at least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some" b'of the other netters are. you seem to have rationally picked out the car that' b'is best for you. the loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by' b'the impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.' b'' b'' b'\tthen again, i may be wrong.' b'' b'yung-kao hsu' b'' b'' b'mihir shah'
