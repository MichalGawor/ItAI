b'' b'' b"i've been running dos for about a month. i was generally impressed with" b'the improvements: the multiple boot configurations were great, the' b'new commands were nice, and doublespace worked fine (twice as slow for' b'large data transfers, twice as fast for small with smartdrv).' b'' b'until now.' b'' b'this morning at am while i was working on my research paper, i had to' b'reboot a hung dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within windows b'when my machine finished rebooting, i found my windows directory and about two' b'thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.' b'' b"i cannot afford problems like this. i'm returning to dos b'' b'mark' b'' b"p.s. i've also noticed bad sector errors from doublespace where none should" b' exist.' b'' b'infoworld (april issue) has two articles about problems with dos' b"6. a 'second look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people" b'should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it. the point out' b'that doublespace and memmaker are both problem areas that will cause a' b'number of folks problems.' b'' b"ms's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported" b'that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).' b'' b'cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned' b'on the support lines his example was a call that cost b'for minutes of tech support after minutes on hold. i want to see' b'the ms spin doctors explain this.'
