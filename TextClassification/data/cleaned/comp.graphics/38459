b'' b'| \tcould somebody let me know of a drawing utility that can be' b'| used to manipulate postscript files.i am specifically interested in' b'| drawing lines, boxes and the sort on postscript contour plots.' b"| \ti have tried xfig and i am impressed by it's features. however" b'| it is of no use since i cannot use postscript files as input for the' b'| programme.is there a utility that converts postscript to xfig format?' b'| \tany help would be greatly appreciated.' b'| \t\t\t\tnishantha' b'i think you are too optimistic! postscript is a very big language and' b'so the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of any arbitrary' b'ps code. the only program i know to manipulate postscript files is' b'islanddraw.' b'i for myself use xfig and include the postscript files (converted to' b'epsi format). small changes then are possible (erasing some letters,' b'adding text and so on).' b'reinhard'
