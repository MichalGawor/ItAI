b'' b'i went out and bought the pas16 yesterday, and installed it into my gateway' b'dx2-66v. i followed the instructions and set the sb side with dma and irq5' b'(the default) and then the pas side with dma and irq my question is how' b'should i configure for mpu-401 compatibility. the manual and installation' b'program recommended irq2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to' b'irq8-15. so can i still use irq2, or should i choose a different one? right now' b'i have the mpu-401 emulation mode turned off. actually what is this "cascade to' b'irq8-15" business?' b'' b'a related questions (to other gw or vl-bus machine owners) i was told that' b'only dma are bit dmas, and are bit dmas. now what about' b'32-bit vl-bus mastering dmas?? which dma channel(s) is used by the vl-bus' b'extension to do 32-bit dma?' b'' b'yet another question, after installing pas16, my links (golf game) will hang' b'the machine when i select sb mode and run, but works with adlib mode??' b'civilization however works fine at least so far). any body knows what i might' b'have done wrong?' b'' b'thanks (i am obviously a newbie) john' b''
