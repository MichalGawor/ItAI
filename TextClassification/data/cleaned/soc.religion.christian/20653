b'' b'the two historic facts that i think the most important are these:' b'' b"(1) if jesus didn't rise from the dead, then he must have done something" b'else equally impressive, in order to create the observed amount of impact.' b'' b'(2) nobody ever displayed the dead body of jesus, even though both the' b'jewish and the roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so' b'(it would have discredited the christians).' b'' b'--' b':- artificial intelligence programs phone b':- the university of georgia fax b':- athens, georgia u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi b'' b'and the two simplest refutations are these:' b'' b'(1) what impact? the only record of impact comes from the new testament.' b'i have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that' b'the recorded "impact" actually happened. i find it interesting that no other' b'contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain' b"being torn, etc. the earliest written claim we have of jesus' resurrection" b'is from the pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than years' b'after the supposed event.' b'' b'(2) it seems probable that no one displayed the body of jesus because no' b'one knew where it was. i personally believe that the most likely' b'explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).' b"don't bother with the point about the guards it only appears in one" b'gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early christians might make' b'up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge. the new testament does' b'record that jews believed the body had been stolen. if there were really' b'guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.' b'' b'-scott o.'
