b'' b'i have this kit which includes the following b'' b'1)\t82c84a/82c84a-5' b'chmos clock generator and driver' b'for 8086,80c88 processors' b'2)\t27c64/87c64' b'64k(8kx8) chmos uv erasable prom' b'3)\t51c259l' b'low power 64k x b'chmos dynamic ram' b'4)\t82c59a-2' b'chmos programmable interrupt controller' b'5)\t82c88' b'chmos bus controller' b'fro 80c86,80c88 processors' b'6)\t80c88/80c88-2' b'8-bit chmos microprocessor' b'7)\t82c55a' b'chmos programmable peripheral interface' b'8)\t82c54' b'chmos programmable interval timer' b'9)\t82c08' b'chmos dynamic ram controller' b'' b"all these are chips with complete manual in a box. i don't know whether they" b"still work or not, and i don't really know what they are." b'' b'so this is mainly for those who knows what this is and have use of it' b'(probably ee stuff since this used to belong to a ee student)' b'' b'anyone interested, please make me an offer.' b'' b'jonina'
