b'' b'does any one out there listen to wfan? for those of you who do' b'not know what i am talking about, it is an all sports radio' b'staion in new york. on a clear night the signal reaches up and' b'down the east coast. in particular, i want to know how len' b"berman and mike lupica's show is. i go to school in virginia" b"so i can't listen when there are on during the day. just" b'wondering.' b'' b"the fan is an okay sports radio station, but doesn't come close to" b'the ultimate in sports radio, wip in philadelphia. the signal' b'might not be as powerful, but then again only stations in new york' b'feel "obligated" to pollute everyone else\'s airwaves with a bunch of' b'hoodlum mets fans complaining hours a day. wip took two of your' b'best sports jockeys too, jody macdonald and steve fredericks. b'wip is rockin with sports talk from am till midnight, check it' b"out anytime your within a few hours of philadelphia. if i'm not" b'mistaken, wip has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation?' b'' b'-rob' b'' b'p.s the only nice thing about the fan is that they talk sports all' b'night. hopefully will begin to do that somewhat soon' b'' b'' b''
