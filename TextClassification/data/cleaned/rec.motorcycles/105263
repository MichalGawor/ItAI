b'' b'' b'' b'' b"a friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new" b'yamaha virago after spending hours very late one chilly evening' b'watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen' b"the brake pedal, &c. &c.) i've pretty much decided never to get this" b'particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter' b'for me. compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his honda, this' b'is just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.' b'' b'' b'patricia' b'' b"sure don't know what bike was being worked on but it sure wasn't a" b"virago. i've owned both the and and you can do the filter" b'change in about mins and nothing has to be removed. obviously the' b'"new" bike was modified as the stock machine is simple to work on.' b'watching for imitators!!' b'--'
