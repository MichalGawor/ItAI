b'' b'i just bought a new ide hard drive for my system to go with the one' b'i already had. my problem is this. my system only had a ide cable' b'for one drive, so i had to buy cable with two drive connectors' b'on it, and consequently have to switch cables. the problem is,' b"the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin on the cable" b'with both pin on the drive itself and pin on the ide card. but' b'for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug' b'in the cable to align these.' b'secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.' b'i figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into' b'the drives. does it matter which i plug into the "master" drive' b'and which into the "slave"? any help appreciated. thanks...'
