b'' b'i consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer. the' b'design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat' b'ofuscated pattern into an eeprom. the idea was to make the circuit' b'difficult to program arbitrary values into the eeprom. the' b'secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint' b'of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid' b'exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the eeprom being used.' b'the microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the hall effect' b'at a rate any higher than mph so as to make spoofing the reading' b'by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable. this was for an' b'automobile that was not expected to ever exceed mph in' b'operation. the case, of course, might not be the same for your' b'1993 rx-7!' b'' b'the ecm modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions' b'under which cars have been operated. since steering angle and' b'velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to' b'collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the' b"drivers' use of the car. i am not aware of any manufacturer" b'currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading' b'out use data from the ecm. while it could be a potential invasion' b'of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your' b'driving style, it could also provide valuable information from' b'actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.' b"i personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving" b'demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.' b'' b'' b'--' b'bill mayhew neoucom computer services department' b'rootstown, oh usa phone:
