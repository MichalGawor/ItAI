b'' b'' b"\tif there was a large propane tank, and it was breached, don't" b'\tyou think that there would be an identifiable explosion?' b'' b'from what i saw of the videotape, there was an explosion which looked' b'more like one due to propane rather than (official version)' b'ammunition.' b'' b'i would agree that a propane explosion is as likely as an' b'ammunition/explosives blast. my question was directed to the' b'person who claimed that the propane tank was likely ruptured' b'by the tank before, or just as, the fire started. if that were' b"true, shouldn't the explosion have happened very soon after" b'the fires started?' b'' b'' b'\tthe only evidence that exists right now (at least what we know' b"\tabout) is various claims and counter claims. i'm waiting until" b'\tthe hard evidence is released. what about you?' b'' b'if only we could be certain that the hard evidence will be released.' b'' b'the fbi has made such a fuss over the videotapes and other' b'evidence that they have to release something sooner or' b"later. it's going to happen, and we'll get to see for" b'ourselves.' b'' b'often law enforcement agencies will withold evidence from' b'public view until the investigation is over.' b'' b'_____ b'\\\\\\\\\\\\/ b'mitchell s todd b"\\_____ tamu.edu b"\\__________\\__ b'\\_ b'\\/____/\\\\\\\\\\\\' b'\\\\\\\\\\\\' b'------'
