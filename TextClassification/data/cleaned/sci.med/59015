b'' b'a bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was' b'discovered. it had produced a dull pain in that area. the hernia' b'was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a' b'"plug and patch".' b'' b'' b'' b'i suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic.' b'' b'' b'' b"now the pain occurs more often. my gp couldn't identify any" b'specific problem. the surgen who performed the original procedure' b'now says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and he' b'said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.' b'' b'my question to the net: is there a nonintrusive method to' b'determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from' b'something else?' b'' b'' b'by far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned' b'physical examination. if you have an obvious hernia sac coming down' b'into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by' b'increasing intra-abdominal pressure....' b'sometimes is not that obvious. the hernia is small and you can only' b'detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.' b'whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous' b"operation, i can't tell you. the person that examined you is in the best" b'position to make that determination.' b'' b'are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? every now and then' b'folks write about ct scans and ultrasounds for this. but these are far' b'too expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.' b'' b'' b'====================================' b'' b'howard doyle'
