b'' b'| hello. i just started reading this group today, and i think i am going' b'| to be a large participant in its daily postings. i liked the section of' b'| the faq about constructing logical arguments well done. i am an atheist,' b'| but i do not try to turn other people into atheists. i only try to figure' b"| why people believe the way they do i don't much care if they have a" b'| different view than i do. when it comes down to it i could be wrong.' b'| i am willing to admit the possibility something religious followers' b'| dont seem to have the capability to do.' b'' b'welcome aboard!' b'' b'|' b'| i notice alot of posts from bobby. why does anybody ever respond to' b'| his posts he always falls back on the same argument:' b'' b'(i think you just answered your own question, there)' b'' b'|' b'| "if the religion is followed it will cause no bad"' b'|' b'| he is right. just because an event was explained by a human to have been' b'| done "in the name of religion", does not mean that it actually followed' b'| the religion. he will always point to the "ideal" and say that it wasn\'t' b"| followed so it can't be the reason for the event. there really is no way" b'| to argue with him, so why bother. sure, you may get upset because his' b'| answer is blind and not supported factually but he will win every time' b"| with his little argument. i don't think there will be any postings from" b'| me in direct response to one of his.' b'' b'most responses were against his postings that spouted the fact that' b'all atheists are fools/evil for not seeing how peachy islam is.' b'i would leave the pro/con arguments of islam to fred rice, who is more' b'level headed and seems to know more on the subject, anyway.' b'' b'|' b'| happy to be aboard b'' b'how did you know i was going to welcome you abord?!?' b'' b'|' b'| dave fuller' b'|' b'|' b'' b'brian
