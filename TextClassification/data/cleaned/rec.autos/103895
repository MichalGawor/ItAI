b'' b"with spring upon us it's time to start waxing again. i was wondering if anyone" b'had any suggestions about waxes and polishes. i know carnuba wax is often' b'recommended on the net, but i was wondering about the colored waxes to cover up' b'some minor scratches. do the colored waxes give on overall good quality shine?' b'are they good for the paint or clear coat?' b'' b'what about liquid glass, is it a clear polish which dries clear; thus filling' b'scratches? is it good for the paint/clear coat?' b'' b"please post with both good and bad experiences. and hey, let's name names" b'(brands) here! b'' b'' b"all gimmicks! stick with plain 'ol carnauba wax that's non-abrasive." b'eagle meguiars, turtle wax, and a few others are good examples.' b"the colored waxes just color in the scratches so they're not so" b'apparent. the better approach is to buff minor scratches completely' b'off with a cleaner/mild abrasive.' b'' b'never tried liquid glass, although i still have this sample they sent' b'me a few years back.' b'' b'aaron' b'' b''
