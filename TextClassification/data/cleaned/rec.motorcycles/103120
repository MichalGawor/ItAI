b'' b're: waving...' b'' b'i must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as i meet other bikers while' b'riding does a lot of good things to my mood... while riding is a lot of fun by' b'itself, there\'s something really special about having someone say to you "hey,' b"it's a great day for a ride... isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time" b'on the road on days like this..." with a gesture.' b'' b'was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin down' b'to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about other people who were' b"down there for similar reasons (there's this great stretch of road on the way" b'down there... no side streets, lotsa leaning bends... went on an' b'impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who' b"i didn't know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless." b'' b'as a fellow commented to me while i was admiring his bike... "hey, it\'s not' b"what you ride, it's that you ride... as long as it has wheels and an engine" b'it\'s the same thing..."' b'--' b'----'
