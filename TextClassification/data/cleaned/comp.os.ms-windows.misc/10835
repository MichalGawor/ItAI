b'' b'i have been backing up my hard drive ever since i had to re-install' b"everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't i?!)." b'i am using a windows-based backup program (actually norton), and i' b'began wondering about the logic of this. sure, if i accidentally delete' b'a file, i can get it from the archive. but what if my disk crashes again?' b'i would not be able to start windows to run the backup program! (note,' b'by crash, i mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine' b"from booting properly. i think i gave up too early, but i didn't have" b'the time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was. my' b'hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. yeah right...) this whole scenario' b'is complicated by the fact that i am using stacker.' b'' b'so i think there are possibilities:' b'' b"1) i'm right. if my disk really crashes, i would at least have to" b're-install dos and windows to get the backup program working.' b'2) i\'m wrong. there is an easy way to make a "mirror" of a hard disk' b"that can easily restore it's state from scratch." b'' b'the polls are open...' b'' b'tom ioerger' b'univeristy of illinois, cs grad student' b''
