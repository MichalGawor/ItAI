b'' b"i've been running dos for about a month. i was generally impressed with" b'the improvements: the multiple boot configurations were great, the' b'new commands were nice, and doublespace worked fine (twice as slow for' b'large data transfers, twice as fast for small with smartdrv).' b'' b'until now.' b'' b'this morning at am while i was working on my research paper, i had to' b'reboot a hung dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within windows b'when my machine finished rebooting, i found my windows directory and about two' b'thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.' b'' b"i cannot afford problems like this. i'm returning to dos b'' b'mark' b'' b"p.s. i've also noticed bad sector errors from doublespace where none should" b'exist.'
