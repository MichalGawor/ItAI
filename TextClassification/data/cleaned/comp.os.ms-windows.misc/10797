b'' b" i'm looking for a program (or toolkit) with which it is possible" b'to create demonstrations very fast. with a demonstration i mean a' b'collection of screens. the one that is looking to the demonstration' b'should be able to make choices (by pressing buttons) to change' b'screens (hypertext??).' b' each screen will contain a question (text or bitmap) and a few' b'answers (buttons). it should be possible to play music and/or show' b'animations (film).' b' i\'ve heard of "animator pro" and "visual basic", but i don\'t know' b'what these can do.' b'' b'autodesk animator is a good tool. the one i like is show partner/fx. if' b'you want it, i could give a copy to you. i did a lot of advertising with it b'it lets you create both graphics (any resolution) and text frames, run it all' b'as a "film", you can make choices and include music i guess that\'s just' b"what you need. if you're really interested, email me." b'' b'vick.'
