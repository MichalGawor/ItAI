b'' b'' b'grf. dropped my shoei rf-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock' b"it onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it..." b'' b"so i cheerfully spent on a bottle of testor's model paint and" b'repainted the scratches and chips for minutes.' b'' b'then, while it was drying, i realized that i was out of smokes and that my' b'cage is not currently running... so i "had to" take my bike down to the' b'store. not wanting to mess up my paint job, i said "well, heck. i can just' b'use my old helmet".... this is your standard el cheapie openface...' b'' b"i didn't notice a big difference when i switched to the shoei, but" b'switching back was really bad...' b'' b"1) doesn't fit worth a damn, too wide in the sides, too short front to" b'back...' b"2) with a faceplate, it's still bloody windy... with the shoei, i normally" b'ignore the face shield until i get up to about 30ish... with this one,' b'taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind.' b'' b'' b'' b"the question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for" b"certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a church" b"meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... what are some guidelines? should i just" b'pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (xl), or should i' b'maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely' b'passenger?'
