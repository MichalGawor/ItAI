b'' b' a friend of mine recently acquired an gc card for his iisi' b' and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white.' b' i know there have been numerous reports about the worth of' b' the gc, but i was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little' b' more on the subject. any replies encouraged. thanks in ad-' b' vance.' b'' b"you may have been emailed this, but the iisi's power supply is not rated to" b'handle the gc board. remember when the si came out and everyone complained' b"about it's power supply. this is one result of apple providing a low-cost" b'computer and i think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end' b"computer (at the time anyways) that couldn't even support their own video" b"board. even if this isn't what is causing your problems, you might develop" b'one later.' b'' b'eric'
