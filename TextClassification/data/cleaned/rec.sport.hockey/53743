b'' b'' b'' b'' b' after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that' b" milwaukee should have an nhl team, i thought i'd pass along a story i heard" b" recently. this is second hand, so i don't know how true it is, but i have" b' no reason to doubt it either.' b'' b' bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge' b" hockey team. the owner of the admirals (sorry, i can't remember his name)" b' either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the' b' bradley center.' b'' b'lloyd pettit.' b'' b'' b' supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise, but' b' turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of million was too' b' high.' b'' b" like i said, i don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if" b" it's true, don't look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon. the admirals" b" aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an nhl club" b" and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the nba's" b' milwaukee bucks play there as well.' b'' b'yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the nhl for $50m; but' b'at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much' b'less than that. he felt that no one would pay $50m for an expansion team, and' b'that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. but' b'the market fooled him, and teams have been created for $50m apiece in the' b"last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than" b'$50m and i doubt that he could get one for that little.' b'' b"pettit gambled and lost. now he'll have to pay more." b'' b'-sg'
