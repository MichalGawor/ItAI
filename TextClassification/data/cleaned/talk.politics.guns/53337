b'' b'i do not think it is at all unlikely that clinton ro his policy' b'wonk facilitators arranged the waco raid as a display piece for the' b'gun war on the constitution. look at what the bush administration did to' b'get material for the drug war on the constitution--remember that baggie of' b'crack george waved at the cameras? they took a dealer from the ghetto' b'and brought him to the white house so they could say drugs had been' b'dealt onb the white house lawn.' b"and i don't think anybody could honestly think clinton would have any" b'moral qualms about the raid...' b"the only really worrisome thing is that the bd's heroic defense of" b"their ranch will make clinton's gun war on the constitution _more_" b'successfull--exactly as he wanted. the media and politicians will' b"filter this so that the general public will think the bd's" b"are bad guys! don't help them. stand up for the bd's with your" b'friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed' b'moral qualms are not important to the issue. they are heroes in the' b'fight against oppressive government; it could just as well have been' b'you.'
