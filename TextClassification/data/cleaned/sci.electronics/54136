b'' b'i have a project in mind that requires an array of leds that can be addressed' b'individually by a microprocessor (say, 16x16 or so). is there an lsi that' b'is designed to drive an led array (including ram to hold the array state),' b"or failing that, some way of multiplexing the display so i don't have to" b'latch a bit for each led using a discrete latch? (i want to avoid having' b'a huge board covered with 373s if possible!) thanks in advance...' b''
