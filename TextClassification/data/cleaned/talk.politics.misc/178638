b'' b'the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire' b'government story. this is simply rationalisation. it is not enough for' b'them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. that would require' b'them to come up with a solution themselves. instead they have to come' b'up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to' b'set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them' b'to get gun control legislation through.' b'' b"what's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all" b'sorts of people desperately trying to "get a revolution." it makes' b'"ambulance chasing" by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime.' b'' b'for the last few months, benighted souls have been calling c-span on issues' b'as mundane as budget resolutions, saying that "i don\'t know, i just have' b'the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country," and so on.' b'' b'get real! for a real case study in revolution, go to blockbuster video' b'and check out "underground," a film made about the weather underground in' b'the 70\'s. even with all the strife back then, the "revolution" never did' b'come. and waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times?' b'' b'in the tape, it is interesting to see the way the weatherpersons dance' b'around the issue of one of their defining moments, which was when a few' b'of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in' b'a greenwich village townhouse. the problem, one of them said, was that' b'they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they *forgot* about' b'their own personal safety and weren\'t "careful." but of course that was' b"*society's* fault, a society that didn't instill a sense of worth in" b'the people, so they neglect their own safety.' b'' b'current apologists for koresh may pick up some important rationalization' b'tips from this tape!' b'' b'---'
