b'' b"so how do i steer when my hands aren't on the bars? (open budweiser in left" b'hand, camel cigarette in the right, no feet allowed.)' b'' b'if i lean, and the' b'bike turns, am i countersteering?' b'' b'no, the bars would turn only *toward* the direction of turn in' b'no-hands steering.' b'' b'just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer,' b"i'll supply one." b'' b'yes, even when steering no hands you do something quite similar' b'to countersteering. basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle' b'of the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to' b'occur to the left. it is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle' b'than a bicycle though, because of the extra weight. (ok, so my' b"motorcycle is heavy. maybe yous isn't.)" b'' b'-david'
