b'' b'on the lindros "trade": like ottawa would be stupid enough to get' b'lindros. why do you think quebec traded him? lindros would go on' b'personal strike again...maybe i should talk to ottawa mgmt. about' b'arranging such a trade.... b'' b'on that xenophobe: thankfully nobody agreed with him publicly. maybe we' b'should look at baseball, the supposed "american" pasttime (sp?). look at' b'all the damn latin americans playing there! they should all be deported!' b"they aren't american! (add sarcasm to taste)" b'' b"to roger: wow, for once we agree. i hope this isn't a sign of things to" b"come.... i'll become a ranting lunatic who talks about nothing but the" b'leafs being the best in the campbell. b'' b'on the rangers: i told someone that nothing that happened in the patrick' b'would surprise me anymore. i lied. how the hell can a team go into' b'washington, earn a shutout, then come back home and lose to pitiful' b"hartford? the absolute *pinnacle* of mediocrity. i can't stand it." b"from what i've read, the goalie is to blame this time, as beezer played" b'pretty poorly. smith is talking about calling up corey hirsch from' b'binghamton, everybody is pointing fingers... this is definitely not the' b'same team which wanted to prove itself in washington. *now* nothing that' b'happens in the patrick will surprise me. (yeah, right... b'' b'' b'' b'--' b"keith keller\t\t\t\tlet's go rangers!!!!!" b"let's go quakers!!!!!" b'' b'"next time you go over my head, i\'ll have yours on a platter."' b'-- cmdr. benjamin sisko,
