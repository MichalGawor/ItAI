b'' b'' b'my goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver "back' b'end" with if input on one end and an fsk demondulator on the other. i\'m' b'particularly interested in ways to use a higher if than do any' b'current chips work up to, say 150mhz with internal downconversion so a' b'normal if filter can be used?' b'' b'' b'gec/plessey specify a series of fm demodulators (sl1454 etc) for use in' b'satellite tv receivers or 600mhz in, 10mhz of baseband video out.' b"i think there's also a related data slicer clock recovery circuit intended" b"for use in dmac decoders, though that isn't used in the most common" b'implementation it may not be in volume production.' b'' b'the most easily available components probably vary with local satellite' b'standards, and i think the european systems vary rather widely from those' b'in the us so it may be worth investigating locally-available receiver' b"designs to find out what's in common use." b'' b'-adrian' b'' b'' b'--' b"obdisclaimer i believe this rubbish don't imagine that anyone else does."
