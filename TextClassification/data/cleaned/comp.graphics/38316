b'' b'hi there,' b'' b"i've made a vga mode 13h graphics library available via ftp. i originally" b'wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone' b'here will find them useful. they are certainly useable as they are, but' b"are missing some higher-level functionality. they're intended more as an" b'intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.' b'' b'*** the library assumes a processor, but it is trivial to modify it' b"*** for a if enough people ask, i'll make the mods and re-post it as a" b'*** different version.' b'' b'the routines are written in assembly (tasm) and are callable from c. they' b"are fairly simple, but i've found them to be very fast (for my purposes," b'anyway). routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a' b'"virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with' b'no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy' b"areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc. i've also included a" b'simple c routine to draw a line, as well as a c routine to load a b"color gif image into a buffer. i also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program" b'that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".' b'' b'the whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip' b'it is zipped with pkzip 2.04g' b'' b"it is completely in the public domain, as far as i'm concerned. do with" b"it whatever you like. however, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due," b"and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)" b'' b'mark'
