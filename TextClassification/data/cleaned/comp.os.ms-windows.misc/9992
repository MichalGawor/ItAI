b'' b'' b'to all the w4w experts:' b'' b'i have a file that is three pages long with to 1-line equations' b'plus a 5"by diagram. the size of this file is about 81kb before' b'unlinking all the embedded objects and 30kb after unlinking all the' b"embedded objects. well, when i print it (since i don't have a laser" b'printer, i have to send it to a print file), w4w gives me back a' b'bbbbbbig file that is well over 6mb long. i just fail to see how a 81k' b'file can be boosted to a 6mb file. obviously, i will not able to carry' b'this 6mb+ file to the public printer unless i find myself a network' b'card, a cable etc.' b'' b'could anyone please enlighten me with a solution? (i already try to' b"print a page at a time, it still won't fit into a hd floppy)" b'' b'thanx a mil.' b'' b'' b'' b'*****************************************************************' b'* dennis woo department of mechanical engineering b'* tel: b'*****************************************************************' b'' b'' b'i once had this problem. all i did was to copy the whole doc to a new file. the problem' b'was gone. hope this helps.' b'' b'hua' b'' b''
