b'' b'' b'' b'' b' help!!!' b' my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car.' b' fyi, just last week the pbs show motor week gave the results of what they' b" thought were the best cars for in the convertible category, the" b' b' honda civic del sol achieved this honor.' b' i own a del sol and i must vouch for the interior. i really looks snazzy wh' b' the top is off. i looks a lot better in person than on the television. (i' b' that motorweek as well. needless to say i was smiling a bit by the time it' b' was over b' b' watch out for that darned "convertible tan" tho...' b'' b'' b' i simply must inquire, how can people honestly consider this car' b' a "convertible"? does porsche have a patent on the "targa" name?' b' i mean, convertible to me means "top down", which the del sol certainly' b' does not do. it has the center that lifts out. this is what i would' b' term a targa(unless porsches was gonna sue me for doing that). i know' b' the rear window rolls down, but i still can hardly consider this car' b' to be a convertible.' b'' b'' b'yes, however, with the top off and the rear window down this car is more' b'like a convertible than a coupe. think of it as a convertible with an' b'integrated roll-bar like addition.' b'' b'jp'
