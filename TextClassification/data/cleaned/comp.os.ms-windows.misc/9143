b'' b'' b'---' b'' b'with my limited knowladge about the pc geos, i came out with following' b'comparison:' b'' b' pc geos windows os/2 unix/x11' b' b'' b'2. can run win' b' programs nop yap yap nop' b'^' b'novell is at least' b'demoing windows apps' b'running under unixware.' b'' b'' b'5. can run unix nop i have not nop yap' b' heard of it' b'^ b'try mks. mks b'others, esp.' b'emx' b'' b'note here: the mks toolkit (for dos/windows os/2) gives you a good' b'suite of standard unix utilities. there are other similar systems from' b'other vendors as well. the emx system for os/2 gives you most of the' b'standard unix system calls for recompiling your unix programs under' b'os/2. not quite the same thing as actually running unix programs' b'directly in either case, but emx makes os/2 almost as compatible with' b'unix systems as many unix systems are with each other. and, best of' b'all, emx is free. b'' b"there is a similar system (go32) for dos, but it doesn't work with" b'windows, as far as i know.' b'' b'7. price free-$1000s' b' a good one' b' costs b' avaliable on ext.' b' card too.' b'' b'should add in the cost for dos with both geos and windows, neither of' b'which is a standalone os at this point. neither os/2 nor unix requires' b'dos.' b'' b"btw, two of the best unices i've seen for the pee cee are unixware b'for the personal edition) and linux (free). so i don\'t agree that "a' b'good one costs b'' b'and, if you really want to check out the various options available to' b'you, you should also look into desqview and desqview/x.' b'' b'cheers' b'--' b'chris waters the insane don\'t |"judy\'s in the bedroom,'
