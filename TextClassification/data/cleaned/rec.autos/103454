b'' b'i used to drive a truck a few years back. i once rode with an old codger' b'that had been driving for about yrs. the only time he would use the clutch' b'was to get the truck moving. he could shift that speed lightning quick, up' b'or down, without the slightest rake of a gear. he was as smooth as silk. it was' b"the most amazing shifting demonstration i've ever seen! having said all that i" b"still don't know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a" b'clutch? why do it?'
