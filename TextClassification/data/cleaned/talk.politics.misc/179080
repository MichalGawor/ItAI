b'' b'' b' i recommend the book "adams _v_ texas", the story of a man (adams) who' b" was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. most of the book" b' is the story of the long appeals process, and the problems and delays' b' caused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts.' b'' b'and i recommend the movie _the thin blue line_, which is about the' b'same case. not as much legal detail, but still an excellent film. it' b'shows how very easy it is to come up with seemingly conclusive' b'evidence against someone whom you think is guilty.' b'--' b'matthew austern maybe we can eventually make language a'
