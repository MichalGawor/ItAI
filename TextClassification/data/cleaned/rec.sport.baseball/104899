b'' b'' b'' b'polish and jewish are *not* mutually exclusive.' b'' b'' b"i didn't mean to offend or anything, i'm just quoting stanky himself on" b'the subject. i remember one time last year he was being interviewed by' b"espn, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked stanky if he was" b'jewish because he (the interviewer) was jewish and wanted to see more' b'jewish ballplayers. to which stanky replied, "i\'m polish, not jewish."' b'' b"so maybe that wasn't the most pc thing for stanky to say, and maybe i was" b'a little naive when i posted it. i think we should just devote this' b'subject to finding actual jewish ballplayers (i myself am jewish and the' b'only ones i ever knew until now were koufax, greenberg, and blomberg).' b'' b'-alan'
