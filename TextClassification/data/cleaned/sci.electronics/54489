b'' b'' b"i'm trying to build a mixer for a friend of mine to run several things into" b'a single boom box. i have a circuit that uses an op-amp powered by either a' b'couple of 9v batteries or using some kind of power supply. but in a catalog' b'i was looking at recently, a "passive mixer" for guitar was advertised taht' b"doesn't appear to use any power at all. does anyone know what the circuit for" b'this would be, because then i could just adapt it for rca jacks, and save my' b'friend and i alot of messing with batteries and plugs. thanks.' b'' b'well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting' b'all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a' b'resistor to a common output. the resistors give some isolation so the' b"signal sources aren't driving directly into each other." b'' b"taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, i'd say that if you are mixing" b'high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,' b'etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5k 10k or so. if you are mixing' b"line-level stuff or the outputs of a walkman, or such, i'd go with 1k." b'' b'input output' b'|' b'input b'|' b'input b'' b'' b'--' b'paul marxhausen b'.. university of nebraska lincoln b'. grace b'. happens
