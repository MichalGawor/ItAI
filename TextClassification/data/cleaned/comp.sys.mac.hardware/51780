b'' b'' b'i just bought a select and rushed home to print' b'some grayscale pictures for my kids, when i discovered that' b'grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are' b"using an se...even if you are running with an cpu." b"you won't see this in the printer's docs, and the apple" b"rep didn't mention it to our users group either. it seems" b'that se roms won\'t support those "features". okay, i' b'guess i should have somehow known that this was the case.' b'let the buyer beware, huh apple?' b'be that as it may, i have been thinking about the' b"problem and i'm puzzled. why can't a defencieny in the" b'rom be made up for in software. i write software for a living' b'(on unix platforms) and i don\'t understand the "it just' b'can\'t be done" responses i\'ve gotten from those i have' b"asked so far. isn't mode32, or somesuch piece of soft-" b'ware, just such a fix.' b'anyway, i was hoping someone knowledgeable' b'about mac internals could set me straight: is it simply' b'impossible for a mac se to print grayscale, or could' b'someone armed with enough info and a little pro-' b'gramming experience cook something up that would' b"supplement the rom's capabilities?" b"also, how does one know if one's mac can" b'support the grayscale and photograde that the select b'is supposedly capable of? short of buying the printer' b'and trying it out like i did)' b'thanks for your help.' b'' b'bill wright' b''
