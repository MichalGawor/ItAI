b'' b'' b'| derek....' b'|' b'| there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights' b'| will come back on after weeks. the tool is in fact illegal (in europe' b'| atleast). it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a' b'| used bmw and a few weeks later, all the lights come on! other than that, i know' b'| of no other tool.... anyone else?' b'|' b'| about changing oil every miles.... thats ok.... on newer audis, they' b'| only require it after every miles (i am talking about an oil change)' b'| just a query: do you drive your car very very carefully? like no sudden' b'| acceleration etc? if yeah, then the m oil change seems quite reasonable.' b"| but if you drive kinda fast... i'd get a bit up tight abot that thingy" b'|' b"| (a point to note: just because the first light came on at 3k, doesn't mean" b'| all the others will come on every 3k too)' b'|' b'| \t\t\t\t\t\t\t....shaz....' b'shaz,' b'' b'hmm.. but the service indicators that i have works this way:' b'there are green,1 yellow, red indicators.' b'initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start' b'your car. the computer will actually "sense" how you drive your car and' b'as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and' b'then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go' b'on. and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.' b'' b'after service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the' b'computer starts counting again.' b'' b'so i expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will' b'come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.' b'' b'i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the' b'indicator.' b'' b"it's the first european car i have and changing oil at miles is a" b"surprise to me. and it's a big plus but i wonder how that could happen" b"since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, i thought it's the oil and" b'not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.' b'' b'any bmw owner on the net? response welcomed.' b'' b'ps. my initial question is "how do you seset the service indicator of a bmw"' b'' b'derek'
