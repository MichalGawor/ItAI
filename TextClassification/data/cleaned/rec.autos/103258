b'' b'yes, i saw a turbo quattro wagon on i-287 in nj on monday. i thought' b'audi stopped selling wagons in the us after the this is exactly the' b'type of vehicle i would like to own. i bet its price is times my' b'car budget.' b'' b'think again!! thanks to minutes (tick tick tick), used b"quattros are bargains.. '89s go for about $15k, '90s go for perhaps b"or 2k more, the valve 91's are quite a bit more because of an" b'enormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about to $25k if' b"you can find one. i have seen quite a lot of quattros (not" b'that many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very high' b'quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will never' b'rust.' b'' b'in short, typically a yr old looks no more older than a year' b'old and the bangers are bullet proof engines. 200k out of one is' b'not rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s. then' b'there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost...' b'' b'if you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just about' b'everything too..' b'' b'the price of parts is a different story though...' b'' b'' b'eliot'
