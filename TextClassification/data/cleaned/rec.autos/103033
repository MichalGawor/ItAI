b'' b'' b"well, i guess i know for sure what i meant, and it is this: i don't know where" b'you drive, but around here freeways are often clogged solid with large packs' b'of semis, trucks, and cars of all descriptions. when i close on one of these' b'rolling clusterf***s on the highway, i have no desire to add my vehicle to this' b'rolling accident looking for a place to happen. if there were any way to pass it' b"i would be passing myself, however i can't. as i posted before, all it" b'takes is a blown tire, or some moron tramping on the brakes to turn this pack' b'into a cloud of shredded metal, flying glass, and burning vehicles. i want to' b'maintain enough free space between myself and this mess to at least have a' b'minimal chance to avoid a mass crash. that means maintaining a clear space' b'between me and it.' b'however, there is no end of shortdriving morons who are dying to pass so they' b"can add themselves and their car to the bodycount. that wouldn't bother me so" b'much except that after letting enough of these morons pass me and glue themselves' b'to the pack ahead, my interval is filled up. trying to back off further does not' b'work because the road behind me has filled up, trapping my car right into an ever' b'increasing pack. now, if there was any slight possibility that there was a lane' b"open ahead, i'd be glad to move over. but, there usually is no way in hell that" b'anybody is going anywhere. so, i block the would-be passers. not only for my own' b'good but theirs as well even though they are often too stupid to realize it.' b'' b'' b"just an comment: i don't like it when people decide what's good for me..." b"if you think you're going to decide anything for me, you'd better be" b'carrying a badge and a gun. who made you capable of determining if there' b'is "no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere"? why do you find' b'it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own' b'business? if someone is minding their own business, i will give them' b"all the room they want, and i'll try to make things easy for them, even" b'letting them in in front of me if they ask politely (with a directional).' b'on the other hand, if someone like you decides they want to block me and' b"be a general asshole, you can bet your ass that i'll make life as" b"miserable as possible for you, as long as it doesn't affect anyone else" b"who's minding their own business." b'they have a phrase to describe someone like you:' b'self appointed traffic police.' b'just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong.' b'' b"as a rule of philosophy, i don't feel particularly sorry when somebody gets" b'offed by his own stupidity, but it does worry me when some idiot is in a position' b'to cash in my chips, too.' b'' b' h.h. mayo' b'' b'' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'___' b"/ mustang gt bob pitas" b'/ up at ned, epping, nh (cambridge, ma)' b'' b'"" geddy lee (in yyz)' b'disclaimer: these opinions are mine, obviously, since they end with my .sig!' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
