b'' b'' b' \tanyway, i was hoping someone knowledgeable' b' about mac internals could set me straight: is it simply' b' impossible for a mac se to print grayscale, or could' b' someone armed with enough info and a little pro-' b' gramming experience cook something up that would' b" supplement the rom's capabilities?" b" \talso, how does one know if one's mac can" b' support the grayscale and photograde that the select b' is supposedly capable of? short of buying the printer' b' and trying it out like i did)' b' \tthanks for your help.' b'' b' bill wright' b'' b'to use the grayscale features, i believe you need a mac equipped' b"with colour quickdraw. i was told this somewhere or other, but it's" b'not mentioned in "apple facts" (guide for apple sellers), in the' b'press release or in the technical specs.' b'' b'sean'
