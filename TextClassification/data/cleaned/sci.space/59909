conduct close-up studies of saturn's" b"satellites, and characterize titan's atmosphere and surface." b'' b'one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its' b'surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that' b'result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. these' b'hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain' b'down onto the surface. the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to' b"peer through titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the" b'surface. experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will' b'investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.' b'' b'the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini the' b'first director of the paris observatory, who discovered several of' b"saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. the titan" b'atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan' b'huygens who discovered titan and first described the true' b"nature of saturn's rings." b'' b'key scheduled dates for the cassini mission (vvejga trajectory)' b'-------------------------------------------------------------' b'10/06/97 titan iv/centaur launch' b'04/21/98 venus gravity assist' b'06/20/99 venus gravity assist' b'08/16/99 earth gravity assist' b'12/30/00 jupiter gravity assist' b'06/25/04 saturn arrival' b'01/09/05 titan probe release' b'01/30/05 titan probe entry' b'06/25/08 end of primary mission' b'(schedule last updated b'' b'' b'galileo jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. has returned' b'the first resolved images of an asteroid, gaspra, while in transit to' b'jupiter. efforts to unfurl the stuck high-gain antenna (hga) have' b'essentially been abandoned. jpl has developed a backup plan using data' b'compression (jpeg-like for images, lossless compression for data from' b'the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve' b'approximately of its original objectives.' b'' b'galileo schedule' b'----------------' b'10/18/89 launch from space shuttle' b'02/09/90 venus flyby' b'10/**/90 venus data playback' b'12/08/90 1st earth flyby' b'05/01/91 high gain antenna unfurled' b'07/91 1st asteroid belt passage' b'10/29/91 asteroid gaspra flyby' b'12/08/92 2nd earth flyby' b'05/93 2nd asteroid belt passage' b'08/28/93 asteroid ida flyby' b'07/02/95 probe separation' b'07/09/95 orbiter deflection maneuver' b'12/95 orbital tour of jovian moons' b'12/07/95 jupiter/io encounter' b'07/18/96 ganymede' b'09/28/96 ganymede' b'12/12/96 callisto' b'01/23/97 europa' b'02/28/97 ganymede' b'04/22/97 europa' b'05/31/97 europa' b'10/05/97 jupiter magnetotail exploration' b'' b'' b'hiten japanese (isas) lunar probe launched has made' b'multiple lunar flybys. released hagoromo, a smaller satellite,' b'into lunar orbit. this mission made japan the third nation to' b'orbit a satellite around the moon.' b'' b'' b'magellan venus radar mapping mission. has mapped almost the entire' b'surface at high resolution. currently collecting a global gravity' b'map.' b'' b'' b'mars observer mars orbiter including m/pixel resolution camera.' b'launched on a titan iii/tos booster. mo is currently in' b'transit to mars, arriving on operations will start for' b'one martian year days).' b'' b'' b'topex/poseidon joint us/french earth observing satellite, launched' b'8/10/92 on an ariane booster. the primary objective of the' b'topex/poseidon project is to make precise and accurate global' b'observations of the sea level for several years, substantially' b'increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. the satellite also' b'will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.' b'' b'' b'ulysses- european space agency probe to study the sun from an orbit over' b'its poles. launched in late it carries particles-and-fields' b'experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for' b'various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.' b'' b'since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send ulysses far out of' b'the ecliptic plane, it went to jupiter instead, and stole energy from' b"that planet by sliding over jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist" b'manuver in february this bent its path into a solar orbit tilted' b"about degrees to the ecliptic. it will pass over the sun's south pole" b'in the summer of its aphelion is au, and, surprisingly, its' b"perihelion is about au-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft" b"that's always further from the sun than the earth is!" b'' b"while in jupiter's neigborhood, ulysses studied the magnetic and" b'radiation environment. for a short summary of these results, see' b'*science*, v. p. september for gory technical' b'detail, see the many articles in the same issue.' b'' b'' b'other space science missions (note: this is based on a posting by ron' b'baalke in with isas/nasda information contributed by yoshiro' b'on updated shuttle manifests;
