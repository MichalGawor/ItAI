b'' b'' b'bullshit. the *bush* administration and the career gestapo were' b'responsible for this horror, and the careerists presented it to the' b"new presidency as a fait accompli. that doesn't excuse clinton and" b"gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it, but let's lay" b'the body at the proper door to start with.' b'' b'the final stages of denial... i can hardly imagine what the result' b'would have been if the clinton administration had actually supported' b"this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so" b"obviously doing. i don't believe the chip originated with the clinton" b'administration either, but the clinton administration has embraced it' b'and brought it to fruition.' b'' b'both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons' b'for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem' b"to feel that they're doing you a favor. if this is really surprising" b"to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of" b"previous evidence. there's only one political party (not calling" b'anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals' b"worthy in and of themselves. if you're voting for the big two, you're" b'supporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their' b'histories), regardless of whether you personally support that' b'reduction. to paint clinton and gore as unwitting tools is really' b'stretching things.' b'' b'--' b'when you have to kill a man it costs nothing to be polite. churchill'
