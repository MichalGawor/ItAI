b'' b'' b' suppose two cubic bezier curves (control points v1,..,v4 and w1,..,w4)' b' which have equal first and last control points (v1 w1, v4 w4). how do i' b' get upper bound for distance between these curves.' b'' b'which distance? the distance between one point (t ti) on the first curve' b'and a point on the other curve with same parameter (u ti)?' b'' b'' b' any references appreciated. thanks in anvance.' b'' b' pekka siltanen' b''
