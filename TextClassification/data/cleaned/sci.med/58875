b'' b'' b'a friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post' b'the following information.' b'' b'a few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting' b'to fall out. she would touch her head and strands of hair would' b'just fall right out. (by the way, she is or years old).' b'it continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the' b'size of a half dollar. since that time, she has gotten two' b"more bald spots of the same size. other symptoms she's" b'described include: several months of an irregular menstrual' b'cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been' b'extremely regular); laryngitis every few days she will wake' b'up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day' b"it's fine; dizzy spells she claims that she's had or b'very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that' b'knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.' b'' b"she went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason" b'for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected' b'thyroid problems. he did the blood work and claims that everything' b'came back normal.' b'' b"she's very concerned and very confused. does anyone have any" b'ideas or suggestions? i told her that i thought she should' b'see an endocrinologist. does that sound like the right idea?' b'' b'** by the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently' b"taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't" b"recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm," b'coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall' b'out.' b'' b'thanks in advance for any help!' b'' b'' b'' b''
