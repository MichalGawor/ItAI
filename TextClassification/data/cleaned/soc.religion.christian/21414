b'' b' one last point: an ex-catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine' b' on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that mary' b' did not die. this is not a correct summary of what catholics believe.' b' the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying' b' whether mary did or did not die. in fact, the consensus among catholic' b' theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die. this would make' b' sense: christ died, and his mother, who waited at the foot of the' b' cross, would want to share in his death.' b'' b'the above article is a good short summary of traditional christian' b'teaching concerning the death of mary.' b'also very good is "re: question about the virgin mary" by micheal d.' b'walker. he tells the story very well.' b'i would like to add that in the eastern orthodox church we celebrate "the' b'dormition (or falling asleep) of the theotokos (the mother of god)". the' b'icon for this day shows mary lying on a bed surrounded by the apostles' b'who are weeping. christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what' b"seems to be a small child. this is, in fact, mary's soul already with" b'christ in heaven. the assumption of mary is one more confirmation for us' b'as christians that christ did indeed conquer death. it forshadows the' b'general resurrection on the last day. the disciples were not surprised' b"to find mary's body missing from the grave. she was the mother of the" b'savior. she was the first of all christians. she gave birth to the word' b'of god. if it were not for her we would not be saved. this is why we' b'pray in the orthodox church, "through the prayers of the theotokos,' b'savior save us."' b'' b'timothy richardson'
