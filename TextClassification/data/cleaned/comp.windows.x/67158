b'' b'[again, poseted for a friend]' b'' b'okay, i got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone),' b'lets try again:' b'' b'how can i tell if a colorcell is read-only?' b'' b'i want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap' b'once i start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary' b'nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to' b'a requested color.' b'' b'once i determine if a cell is read-only, i assume i can then just request' b'an xalloccolor() with the exact same color specifications and it will' b"then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get" b'freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another' b'application.' b'' b"so far, the only way i've figured out to do this is to write my own" b'error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my' b'colormap is all full up. it should error out if the cell is non-shareable.' b'but life would be much easier if i could just detect the' b'read-only/shareable stuff directly...' b'' b'any ideas?' b''
