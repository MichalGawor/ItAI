b'' b'' b'i was recently talking to a possible employer mine! and he made a reference to a' b'48-bit graphics computer/image processing system. i seem to remember it being called image or' b"something akin to that. anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color a 12-bit alpha channel. that's" b"60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for? specifically the 48-bit color? that's b'trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve. is this an anti-aliasing thing? or' b'is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.' b'' b"also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are sgi's flagship products? i know of" b'iris, indigo, and crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line?' b'(sadly, i have access to none of them. just a dec sigh.)' b'' b'eric oehler' b''
