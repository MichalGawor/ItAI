b'' b'' b'hello there. the other day i was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought' b'about constructing an old-time crytal radio set. i figured on' b'substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the' b'antenna coil, etc., myself.' b'' b'the only problem i seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning' b'capacitor you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which' b'used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits. well these things seem to' b'be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats. trimmer' b'capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this' b'application.' b'' b'so, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the' b'0--360 pf range?' b'' b'manythanks.' b'' b'--' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'greg neill, ounce (ouns), n. the standard unit of' b'hnsx supercomputers inc.| prevention, equal to one pound of cure.'
