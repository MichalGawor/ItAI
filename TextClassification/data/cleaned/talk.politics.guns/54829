b'' b'' b'' b'firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area. it would not' b'be economic to smuggle them in. all production would have to be' b'local. there are not all that many people who have both the skill' b'and motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.' b'high-ranking crime figures could obtain imported uzis and such, but' b'the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun' b'- and would pay through the nose for it.' b'' b'good point you make. however, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,' b'homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate' b'fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun. recall' b'the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the allies during world war ii for' b'use by partisans. they were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of' b'effective fire beyond a few feet. but they were useful as a means of' b'killing german soldiers for their guns.' b'' b"also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the sten gun, was" b'specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.' b"the point's been made here that one could make a sten clone with steel" b'tubing, hand tools and a welder.' b'' b"i still think that while the point is good, i think there's a difference" b'between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown' b"locally; there's no need to import the stuff. if guns are banned, i" b'think the demand for "real" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling' b'economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot. in any case, the' b"result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have" b'firearms, and "bad guys" will continue to have access to them, one way' b"or another. and i don't see that as a necessary situation." b'--'
