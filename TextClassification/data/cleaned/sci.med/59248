b'' b'' b'' b'' b'my year son is so plagued. lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems' b"to keep it under control. but let him get bopped there, and he'll recur for" b'days! also allergies, colds, dry air all seem to contribute. but again, the' b'vaseline, or a&d ointment, or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring.' b'' b'if you can get it, you might want to try a canadian over-the-counter product' b'called secaris, which is a water-soluble gel. compared to vaseline or other' b"greasy ointments, secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's" b'already there.' b'' b'' b'secaris is reasonably inexpensive cdn for a tube), and is indeed an' b'over the counter medication. why it does not appear to be available in the' b"us, i don't know. it's manufactured in montreal." b'' b"it's a nasal lubricant, and is intended to help nosebleeds that result from" b'dry mucous membranes.' b'' b"from some of the replies to my original posting, it's evident that some" b'people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected' b"from environmental influences (ie, dry air). but i've had no responses" b'from anyone with experience with rutin. is there another newsgroup that' b'might have specifics on herbal remedies?' b'' b'but thanks to all those who did reply with their experiences.' b'--' b'robert allison'
