b'' b'another one rescued from the bit bucket...' b'' b'over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and' b'elsewhere on the net. generally, the discussion comes down to the' b'contention on the one hand that tsv contains such blood libel against' b'islam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probably' b'some sort of punishment; and on the other that rushdie, particularly' b'as a non-muslim in a western country, had every right to write and' b'publish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find it' b'offensive, without fear of persecution or death.' b'' b'i am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in an' b'interesting position, because i think this is a fine book, only' b"incidentally concerned with islam, and moreover i'm damned if i can" b'find anything malevolently offensive in it.' b'' b'over the years, when i have made this point, various primarily muslim' b'posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book' b'and had called it such things as "filth and lies", "i would rank' b'rushdie\'s book with hitler\'s mein kempf or worse", and so on.' b'unfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attempts' b'to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so' b'offensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, or' b'inaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to' b'believe that few of them have actually read it]. corrections and' b'attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.' b'' b'anyway, since i seem to be the only one following this particular line' b'of discussion, i wonder how many of the rest of the readership have' b'read this book? what are your thoughts on it?' b'--' b'these are my opinions. for a nominal fee, they can be yours.' b'' b'' b'--' b'these are my opinions. for a nominal fee, they can be yours.'
