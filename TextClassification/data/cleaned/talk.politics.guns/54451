b'' b'' b'| i have been convinced of the right of americans to an effective' b'| self-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the' b'| pro-rkba arguments presented here.' b'|' b'| the numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a' b'| million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring' b'| criminal activity, seem valid to me. likewise the number' b'| of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?). however,' b'| it is surprising that the "evil antigun empire (darth vader' b'| breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare' b'| "all legitimate gun defenses" vs. "all gun crimes." instead,' b'| it\'s always "all legitimate gun defenses," which includes' b'| cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and' b'| cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just' b'| criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which' b'| the victim died.' b'|' b"| why is this? of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say" b'| that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the' b'| consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that' b'| a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn' b'| into a gun-basd robbery+homicide. whereas in the legitimate' b'| gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who' b'| were deterred would have committed more crime or more' b'| serious crimes had they not been deterred.' b'' b'i think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost; all other' b"gun related crimes don't result in lives_lost. on the other hand," b'its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses' b'prevented lives from being lost. in other words, the lives_lost' b'is pretty clear [its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter' b'number], while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful' b"self defenses. clearly that percentage doesn't have to be real" b'high to show that lives_saved lives_lost.' b'' b'as a semi-related point, check out kleck\'s "point blank". i believe' b'it goes into some related areas; it also is well written and informative.' b'' b'|' b'| -case kim' b'|' b'|' b'' b'--' b'(and last but not least a disclaimer) these opinions are mine..'
