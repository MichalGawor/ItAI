b'' b"it's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, the" b'formatting software installs a driver on the disc, if you insert the' b"disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's" b'memory and then controls the drive, and if this driver is incompatible' b'with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written' b'is that correct?' b'' b'thanks,' b'jim frazier'
