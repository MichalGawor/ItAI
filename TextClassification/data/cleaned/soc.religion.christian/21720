(it included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g. the' b'virgin birth.) the term is now being used by the press to describe' b'aggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who' b'are attempting to legislate religion.' b'' b'legalism is yet another ill-defined term. however there is some' b'reason for its use in this context. in fact the common theological' b'definition is the believe that salvation is through the law. i hope' b'no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this' b'view. however there is a basic difference in approach over what we' b'expect to get out of the bible. the conservative approach expects to' b'find specific behavioral rules. generally the posters advocating this' b"approach talk about the relevant passages from paul's letter as god's" b'law. the liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it' b'regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the' b"culture and other things. it's easy to see why a liberal would regard" b"the conservative approach as legalism. it's hard to know quite what" b'other term to use. the issue in this case is not inerrancy, because' b'no one is saying that paul made a factual error. rather, the question' b'is whether his statements are to be taken as law. calling the' b"positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology. i haven't" b'seen any good alternative.' b'' b'--clh]'
