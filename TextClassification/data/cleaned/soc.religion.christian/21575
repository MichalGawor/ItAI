b'' b'' b'[bible verses ag./ used ag. homosexuality deleted]' b'' b'anyone who thinks being gay and christianity are not compatible should' b'check out dignity, integrity, more light presbyterian churches, affirmation,' b'mcc churches, etc. meet some gay christians, find out who they are, pray' b'with them, discuss scripture with them, and only *then* form your opinion.' b'' b'also check out the episcopal church although by no means all' b'episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women, there' b'certainly is a fairly large percentage (in my experience) who are. i' b'am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and' b'living in a monogamous homosexual relationship. this in no way' b'diminishes his ability to minister in fact he has a very' b'significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his' b'community, as well as a very significant aids ministry.' b'' b'my uncle is gay and when i found this out i had a good long think' b'about what the bible has to say about this and what i feel god thinks' b'about this. obviously my conclusions may be wrong; nonetheless they' b'are my own and they feel right to me. i believe that the one' b'important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament' b'passages cited above did not know was that there is scientific' b'evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly _inherent_' b'rather than completely learned. this means that to a certain extent' b'-- or to a great extent homosexuals cannot choose how to feel about' b'other people which is why reports of "curing" homosexuals always' b"chill me and make me feel ill. please not that, although i can't cite" b'sources where you can find this information, there is homosexual' b'behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals, which is in itself' b'suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned, or at least that' b'the word "unnatural" shouldn\'t really apply....' b'' b'please remember that whatever you believe, gays and lesbians shoul not' b'be excluded from your love and acceptance. christ loved us all, and' b'we all sin. and he himself never said anything against homosexuals b'rather it is paul (who also came out with such wonderful wisdom as' b'"women shouldn\'t speak in church" and "women should keep their heads' b'covered in church" not exact quotations as i don\'t have my bible' b'handy) who says these things. i have a tendency to take some of the' b'things paul says with a grain of salt....' b'' b"well, that's all i'll say for now." b'' b'*************************************************' b'*ms o b'*nasa langley research center b'*hampton, va b'*************************************************' b'' b'vera noyes' b'-------' b"the lord is risen indeed. let's party!"
