b'' b' i forgot to ask: is this the highest points total francis has' b'had in a season? has he ever had a point season before,' b'either with the pens or the whalers?' b'' b'' b'francis got in his last full season with hartford.' b'' b'in agreement with your previous post, i think francis is a tremendous and' b'generally underrated complete player. i would love to have him here in a' b'capitals uniform where he would certainly be the center (even though' b'pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated).' b'francis impresses me in many ways as an "ethical dale hunter". tons of' b'heart and can-do attitude with a lot of different skills, but none of' b'the cheap shots and few penalty minutes. not to mention nearly always' b"coming through when it's important." b''
