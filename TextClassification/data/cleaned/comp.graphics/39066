b'' b'' b'' b' i put it to you thus: where has the hacker ethic gone? if it still exists,' b' where? and, if it does exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers"' b' allowing this to perpetuate itself? why are they not creating new, innovative,' b' interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the' b' computer industry?' b'' b'since this was posted on comp.ai, i assume there is an ai angle to this. hacking is' b"what ai students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g." b"thesis research write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly," b'etc. no-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.' b'producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time resources that' b'not many people can, or want to, afford particularly during a recession.' b'' b'in addition, over the last years, i think there has been a de-emphasis on producing' b'running programs in ai research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to' b'problem-solving. students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.' b'at a conference a year or two ago, johann de kleer suggested that everyone should' b"'get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas b"and i have to say i'm inclined to agree." b'' b"(i don't claim to be a superhacker, but i don't think that invalidates my remarks." b"and i'm sure this isn't the whole story.)" b'' b'' b'--' b'peter jackson, dept of electrical computer eng, clarkson university' b'"opinions expressed are not those of my employer or any other organization"' b'second violin, fiddling firefighters ensemble (rome branch)'
