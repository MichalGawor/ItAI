b'' b'i have had a sore throat for almost a week. when i look into' b'the mirror with the aid of a flash light, i see white plaques in' b'the very back of my throat (on the sides). i went to a health' b'center to have a throat culture taken. they said that i do not' b'have strep throat. could a viral infection cause white plaques' b'on the sides of my throat?' b'' b'first, i am not a doctor. i know about this because i have been' b'through it.' b'' b'it sounds like tonsilitis (lit. swollen tonsils). feel under your jaw' b'hinge for a swelling on each side. if you find them, its tonsilitis.' b"i've had this a couple of times in the past. the doctor prescribed a" b'weeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up.' b'' b'in my case it was associated with glandular fever, which is a viral' b'infection which (from my point of view) resembled flu and tonsilitis' b'that kept coming back for a year or so. there is a blood test for' b'this.' b'' b'in conclusion, see a doctor (if you have not done so already).' b'' b'paul.' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------' b'these ideas and others like them can be had gec-marconi research is not' b'for each from any reputable idealist. responsible for my opinions'
