b'' b'' b' what is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling? couple hours after' b'you "feel" sober? what? or should i just work with "if i drink tonight, i' b'don\'t ride until tomorrow"?' b'' b'this thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court' b'a few years ago. while i was waiting my turn to state my case and' b'plea of why i was going in a in my cage, i had the opportunity' b'to listen to some of the "creative excuses" offered the judge by others.' b'' b'after listening to a number of "well, i was passing a very slow truck' b'that suddenly speed up" versions, i decided that the judge had heard' b'just about every story in the book and then some. he was less than' b'impressed with any of them.' b'' b'this young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a' b'rather drill sargent looking ohio state highyway patrol trooper.' b'he was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of mph in a mph' b'zone. it was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had' b'alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.' b'' b'the judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose' b'and said in his sternest voice: "well son, those are some pretty' b'fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle. what do you have to say for' b'your self?"' b'' b'"well sir", meekly the defenant replied, "i just was over to my' b'buddys and we had a couple of beers and i was on my way home."' b'he offered nothing more or less. just had a couple of beers and' b'was doing mph on his way home.' b'' b'the judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the' b'maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him' b'to attend remedial drivers training school.' b'' b"isn't america great??" b'' b'' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------' b'bill mohrman 81-cb900c' b'motorola sps' b'columbus, oh' b'------------------- disclaimers apply
