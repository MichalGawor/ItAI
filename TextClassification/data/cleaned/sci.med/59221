b'' b'' b'i have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning epilepsy and' b'seizures. i am also interested in this subject i have a son with' b'epilepsy and i am very active with the local association. i posted a' b'message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it' b'is again.' b'' b'is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on epilepsy and' b'seizures? this would allow us to hold discussions and share' b'information via electronic mail. i already run a listserver for two' b'other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.' b'' b'if you are interested, mail me a note. if i get enough replies, i will' b'make it happen and provide you with the details.' b'' b'btw, i have also started a database on epilepsy. this is part of my' b'research on natural language question answering systems. users of this' b'service are able to ask questions about epilepsy and the program' b'searches the database and retrieves its best response. the technology' b'works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have' b'been seen before. all new questions that are not answered are recorded' b'and used to improve the system.' b'' b'this database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new' b'information. to try it out, do the following' b'' b'telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca' b'login: chat' b'' b'then select the epilepsy item from the menu of databases.' b'' b'--' b'andrew patrick, ph.d. communications research centre, ottawa, canada' b'' b'for a good time, run "telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca" and login as "chat".'
