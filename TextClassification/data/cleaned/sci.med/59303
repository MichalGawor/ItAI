b'' b'' b"as for how foods taste: if i'm not allergic to msg and i like" b"the taste of it, why shouldn't i use it? saying i shouldn't use" b"it is like saying i shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor" b'has an ulcer.' b'' b"julie, it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it (msg or" b'something else for that matter) simply because you are not allergic' b'to it. for example you might not be allergic to (animal) fats, and' b"like their taste, yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them" b'(regularly). msg might have other bad (or good, i am not up on' b"knowledge of msg) effects on your body in the long run, maybe that's" b'reason enough not to use it.' b'' b'perhaps i should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese' b'which all have msg in them. it occurs naturally.' b'' b"i'm not going to quit eating something that i like just because" b'it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some*' b'people. i would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over' b'what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting' b'reports of what is good/bad for you.' b'' b'i may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me.' b"fine. i've made my decision and i don't think it's appropriate" b'for anyone to try to \'convert\' me. "it\'s for your own good" are' b'the most obnoxious and harmful words, imo, in the english (or' b'any other) language.' b'' b'' b"altho' your example of the ulcer is funny, it isn't an" b'appropriate comparison at all.' b'' b"i think it is. i get tired of people saying 'don't eat x because" b"it's bad!' well, x may not be bad for everyone. and even if" b"it is, so what? give people all the information but don't ram" b'your decisions down their throats.' b'' b'julie' b'disclaimer: all opinions here belong to my cat and no one else'
