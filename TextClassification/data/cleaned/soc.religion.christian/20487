b'' b"matt. 'go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find" b"there, invite to the wedding feast.'..." b'' b"hmmmmmm. sounds like your theology and christ's are at odds. which one am i" b'to believe?' b'' b'in this parable, jesus tells the parable of the wedding feast. "the kingdom' b'of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son".' b'so the wedding clothes were customary, and "given" to those who "chose" to' b'attend. this man "refused" to wear the clothes. the wedding clothes are' b'equalivant to the "clothes of righteousness". when jesus died for our sins,' b'those "clothes" were then provided. like that man, it is our decision to' b'put the clothes on.'
