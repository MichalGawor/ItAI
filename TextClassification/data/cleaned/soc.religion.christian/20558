b'' b"i'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already," b'but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the' b'environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into' b'pantheism?' b'' b'yes.' b'' b'(i am adamantly an environmentalist. i will not use styrofoam table service.' b'please keep that in mind as you read this post i do not wish to attack' b'environmentalism)' b'' b'a half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie. a complete lie will' b'rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more' b'powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.' b'' b'satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something' b"other than god's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the" b'health of future generations is based. it is being treated with respect. you' b"think he's going to happily leave it at that? no. when one error is rejected," b'it is his style to push people to the opposite error. therefore the earth is' b"not god's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is" b'god. mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.' b'' b'i see two facets of a response to it:' b'' b'1: care for the environment. treat it with proper respect, both because it is' b"god's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because" b'showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not' b'constitute what the apostle paul called "becoming all things to all men so' b'that by all possible means i might save some."' b'' b'don\'t say "forget the environment, i\'ve got important things to spend my time' b'on." putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your' b'credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.' b'' b'2: show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not' b'creator. show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and' b'glory. show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords' b'woven in the infinite tapestry.' b'' b'################################################################################' b'# "god, give me mountains "but the greatest jonathan hayward b'################################################################################'
