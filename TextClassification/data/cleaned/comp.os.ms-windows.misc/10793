b'' b'i really think you are comparing apples and oranges. nobody disputes' b'that os/2 has more big os features. the question is does an' b'individual need the power. the sales of windows vs os/2 answer that' b'question. the next question is even if i did want to run os/2' b'and i had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse' b'set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my' b'work. go to your local computer store to answer this one.' b'i think the comparison you need to be doing is nt vs os2/2.1. this' b'is where the new battle lines will be drawn. windows has won' b'the single user pc war the next one will be the client server' b'war and the entries are nt, os2/2.1, unix and netware b"granted these os's will be eventually scaled down to be" b"attractive to the single user pc and that will probably be phase ii'" b'of the war. who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure' b'is fun watching and arguing about it tho.' b'thx dave l' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
