b'' b'according to the osf/motif style guide, one should use cursor shapes to give' b'the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. so' b'a "hourglass" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a' b'"caution" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in' b'another. defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level.' b'so defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain' b'subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. when cursors have been defined' b'for some windows, e.g. a "crosswire" cursor for a drawingarea, things get even' b'more complicated. my intuition says that things should be easier, but is this' b'so? if anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me' b'know. the topics on "busy cursors" in the several faq\'s are not helpful, since' b'they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window' b"attribute set to 'none'." b'-----------------------------------------------------------------' b'hans geurtsen phone: b'surface: waardgelder b'nl-3905 th veenendaal' b''
