(i thought i heard something on the news about' b'|this.)' b'' b'the ss has previously ruled that since the seperate governments were in' b'essence seperate sovereigns, then double jeopardy does not apply.' b'' b'(if this is true, then could defendents also be tried under city and' b'county governments?)' b'' b'this mornings paper said that the aclu has decided to reinstate its' b'opposition to this kind of thing. they had earlier suspended their' b'opposition while they examined the king case. there might be hope' b'for the aclu after all.' b'--' b"mob rule isn't any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government" b"it ain't charity if you are using someone else's money." b"wilson's theory of relativity: if you go back far enough, we're all related."
