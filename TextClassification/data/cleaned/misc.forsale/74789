b'' b'|' b'|' b'| recently i bought a musical instrument through the internet and had' b'| it shipped to me via ups ground. the shipping was done through a' b'| mail box service, mailboxes, etc. being somewhat surprised at the' b'| price, i compared prices of shipping this way to shipping directly' b'| through ups and this is a summary. i am not making any endorsements' b'| or condemnations but merely presenting the facts from which you may' b'| draw your own conclusions.' b'| b'|' b"| i've encountered the same thing with mailboxes, etc. and i suggest" b'| anyone to use the original ups service if at all possible. shipping' b'| to virginia from cleveland was around for pounds, and c.o.d.' b'| was as opposed to for ups.' b'' b"i'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. now, when i" b"buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, i'll specify that i" b'only pick up the normal ups charges (as if delivered directly to' b"ups), as i've been burned by shipping charges for a pkg." b"i will never use a mailing service unless i don't have the" b"right box and the buyer needs whatever immediately. i'll also" b'tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.' b'' b'other things to watch out for/consider:' b'' b'the rates are to higher than ups direct.' b'' b'for a non-ups (truck) package, they quoted a rate' b'of fed ex economy air was only for the' b'same weight! rps (a trucking package company, in many' b'cities) only wanted guess who got it. the mailbox' b'operator told me i was not telling the truth about' b"competitors' rates, said rps was unreliable (i've used them" b'before with no problems), etc. right.' b'' b'a cod check goes to the mailing service. our local' b'mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the' b'remade check. all this for an additional over the' b'ups cod charge. what a deal.... b'' b'for packages over they charge you about double over' b"what ups charges them for insurance. i've never had" b'a claim, but other netters (is ralph seguin out there?)' b'have told horror stories about them...' b'' b'all package traces have to be done through mailbox by' b'mailbox.' b'' b'our local mailbox operator told me i was lying when i' b'asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared' b'to direct ups. does he ever check? probably not...' b'' b"their ups ground rates come close to fed ex's economy" b'air rate, and fed ex will pick up!' b'' b'ups will pick up for a charge in most areas!' b'' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------' b'dave medin\t\t\tphone:\t(205) (w)' b'ssd--networking\t\t\t\t(205) (h)' b'intergraph corp.' b'huntsville, al 35894\t\tuucp: ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin' b'' b'******* everywhere you look (at least around my office) b'' b'* the opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)'
