b'' b'' b' david thibedeau (sp?), one of the cult members, said that the fire' b'was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the' b'facilities knocked over a lantern.' b'' b'in two places at once? bit of a coincidence, that.' b'' b'never lived out in the country i see. years ago i had a place' b'where i had to carry in propane every month, hook the bottle up' b'to copper line, to supply both the stove, and a type of water-' b'heater called a flash-heater. a flash heater has a pilot lamp.' b'' b"here's the point. if the davidians had their propane tanks hooked" b'up to copper (or some such) lines, run through the ceiling spaces' b'-- when the fbi started wrecking the place, they could easily have' b'ruptured the lines. which then would start spreading out through' b"the overhead. and since it was a country home, it wasn't necessarily" b'built with non-flamable insulation.' b'' b"it's probably more plausible than anything else, that the fire started" b'mainly as a result of accident or willful negligence on the part of' b'the fbi, which should have known better (ie. manslaughter).' b'' b"it's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day the fire" b"wouldn't have started." b'' b'whatever the faults the fbi had, the fact is that responsibility' b'for those deaths lies with koresh.' b'' b'paul, what "fact?"'
