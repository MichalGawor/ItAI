b'' b'' b"as of last week, mac's place had the applied engineering quicksilver card" b'(32k cache, one pds slot, socket for fpu) on sale for (without fpu).' b'regular price is b'' b'no idea if this is still going on, but i can get the phone no. if anyone is' b'interested (i found their ad in macuser).' b'' b'' b'can some people with cache cards please post speedometer numbers they get' b'with the cards. i have only one report, which seems to indicate that' b'a 32k cache card gives you only about a speedup!! access to memory takes' b'longer when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card' b"of 32k may be worth i don't know what kind of numbers 64k cards get" b'you. also i found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards' b'via software(read about it in the mac iisi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)' b'' b"so is a good deal or not, i still don't know."
