b'' b'' b'' b'you could take a screw driver and hammer and start punching holes in' b'various locations and when some black slippery stuff starts pouring' b'out then you would know that the oil drain plug is nearby (within a foot' b'or two anyway). close the holes with toilet paper before refileing with oil' b'though.' b'' b"you have to *refill* the engine with oil! wow, no wonder i can't get" b"an engine to last more than my first oil change. don't forget to" b'punch holes in the radiator too, it will spray nice refreshing water' b' b'on the engine and keep it nice cool. b'' b'-steve' b'' b'gee, you really make me confused. what is radiator? where is it located?' b'what does it look like? will it release any radiation (since it sounds' b'like radia-tion genera-tor) when you punch holes?' b'' b'' b'of course it releases radiation! thats why your car goes faster when' b'you punch the holes in it. all that radiation gets on your engine' b'and gives it "pep" (scientific term). you get more horsepower b"torque too! if you don't know what hp torque are, you can read" b'mile long threads on the subject, but they are all wrong. horsepower' b'is how much power a horse can make pulling a subaru, and torque is' b'a name invented by craftsman for a wrench.' b'' b'-steve' b''
