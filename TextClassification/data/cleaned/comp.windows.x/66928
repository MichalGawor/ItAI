b'' b'' b'' b' ports of motif to both 386bsd and linux are available for a fee of about' b' this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to' b' redistribute. the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups' b' pertaining to motif has been high.' b'' b'' b' i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial' b' and non-commercial software (ie. you will only get free software using' b' athena or openlook widget sets, and only get commercial software using' b' the motif widget sets).' b'' b'' b" i can't see why. if just about every workstation will come with motif" b' by default and you can buy it for under for the "free" unix' b" platforms, i can't see this causing major problems." b'' b'let me add another of my concerns: yes, i can buy a port of motif for "cheap",' b'but i cannot get the source for "cheap", hence i am limited to using whatever x' b'libraries the motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of' b'motif. i have been told that motif can be used with any x, but i have not' b'seen it myself).' b'' b'currently, i have x11r5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which' b'only three came with motif. on those three, i am unable to use the x11r5' b'libraries to build motif clients, because i get link errors between the' b'vendor-supplied port of motif and my x11r5. i anticipate having this same' b'problem when x11r6 becomes available.' b'' b'the result is that i cannot build motif clients that rely on x11r5, since i do' b'not have motif compiled under x11r5. true, i could buy another port of motif,' b'but that sort of ruins the whole idea of "free", doesn\'t it?' b'' b'cheers,' b'' b'tom mcconnell' b'--' b'intel, corp. c3-91 phone: b'5000 w. chandler blvd. the opinions expressed are my own. no one in' b'chandler, az their right mind would claim them.'
