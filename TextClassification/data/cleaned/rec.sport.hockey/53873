b'' b'my vote goes to john vanbiesbrouck. his mask has a skyline of new york' b'city, and on the sides there are a bunch of bees (beezer). it looks' b'really sharp.' b'' b'funny you should mention this; one time on hnic don cherry pointed out' b"vanbiesbrouck's mask. he _hated_ it. i think he said something to the effect" b'of:' b'"you see? he was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask' b'and he can\'t stop a beachball!"' b'' b'you may or may not take cherry seriously at all, but i cracked up when i heard' b'it.' b'' b'i think ed belfour has the current best mask in the nhl btw. i also like' b"moog's, and i'll give fuhr's new one an honourable mention, although i haven't" b"seen it closely yet (it looked good from a distance!). what's also neat is" b'chevaldae\'s in detroit; they call him "chevy" so he has two checkered flags' b'painted at the top as in an auto race.' b'' b''
