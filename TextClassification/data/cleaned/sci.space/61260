b'' b'' b'' b'a bright light phenomenon was observed in the eastern finland' b'on april at ut two people saw a bright, luminous' b'pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near' b'mikkeli. the head of the pillar was circular. the lower part' b'was a little winding. it was like a monster they told. they' b'were little frightened. soon the yellowish pillar became' b'enlarged. a bright spot like the sun was appeared in the middle' b'of the phenomenon. at last the light landed behind the nearby' b'forest. now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were' b'visible till morning sunrise.' b'' b'the same phenomenon was observed also by jaakko kokkonen in' b'lappeenranta. at ut he saw a luminous yellowish trail in' b'the low northeastern horizont. the altitude of the trail was' b'only about degrees. soon the trail began to grow taller.' b'a loop was appeared in the head of the trail. it was like a' b'spoon. this lasted only seconds. now the altitude was about' b'five degress above horizont. he noted a bright spot at the' b'upper stage of loop. the spot was at magnitude the loop' b'became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of' b'the loop. a cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright' b'spot. after a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails' b'were only visible in the low horizont. luminous trails were still' b'visible at ut in the morning sky.' b'' b"the phenomenon was caused by a russian rocket. i don't know if" b'there were satellite launches in plesetsk cosmodrome near' b'arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. since b'we have observed over rocket phenomena in finland. most of' b'these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium' b'experiments and other chemical releases. during these years we' b'have observed satellite launches.' b'' b'leo wikholm' b'' b'=====================================================================' b'ursa astronomical association i phone b'satellite and rocket phenomena sect. i fax b'laivanvarustajankatu c i bbs b'finland i' b'====================================================================='
