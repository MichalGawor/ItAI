b'' b"this posting reminded me about a long-standing question i've had." b'does it' b'pay to consider an underwater camera for pictures taken on land but' b'in' b'harsh environments (e.g. rain, snow, heat, cold, mud, dust)? or are' b'the' b'lenses, etc. all "tuned" for the refractive index of water?' b'' b'i have had a nikon l35aw since unfortunately it is no longer' b'made. it is a p s sealed to resist water to a depth of feet. it' b'is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and' b'dusty conditions. it takes aa batteries (hooray). it has the solid,' b'heavy feel of old-style nikons and has taken all the abuse i have' b'been able to give it. this includes a lot of water (rain, river and' b'sea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon' b'against a mugger. shouting and swinging the camera by the strap' b"didn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera" b'did. this is my, "never be without a camera" camera. the current' b'water-resistant (sport touch i think is the name) model is nothing' b'like as solid or well sealed.' b'' b'don mackie his opinions'
