b'' b'[referring to mary]' b'she was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to original sin,' b'but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life. this was' b'possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by god.' b'' b'i have quite a problem with the idea that mary never committed a sin.' b'was mary fully human? if it is possible for god to miraculously make' b'a person free of original sin, and free of committing sin their whole' b"life, then what is the purpose of the incarnation of jesus? why can't" b'god just repeat the miracle done for mary to make all the rest of us' b'sinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that?' b'' b"i don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption, or the" b'perpetual virginity (both of which i regard as catholic dogma about which' b'i will agree to disagree with my catholic brothers and sisters in' b'christ), and i even believe in the virgin birth of jesus, but this' b"concept of mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the" b'rest of christian doctrine as i understand it.' b'' b'==' b'seanna watson bell-northern research, pray that at the end of living,' b'| god will find his people busy' b'opinion, what opinions? oh *these* opinions. planting trees and sowing seeds.' b"no, they're not bnr's, they're mine. b"i knew i'd left them somewhere. --fred kaan"
