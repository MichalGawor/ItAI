b'' b' i would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for' b' humans. i am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere' b' evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet. the question' b' is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.' b'' b'this is a good question. there are major blind spots in our understanding' b"of what makes the earth habitable. for example, why does the earth's" b'atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does? the naive' b'answer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete. photosynthesis' b"by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced" b'is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten. what is needed' b'is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of' b'the resulting reduced material.' b'' b'on earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic' b'matter, mostly from oceanic sources. however, this burial requires' b'continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow' b'that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).' b'' b'this suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without' b'continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating' b'an oxygen atmosphere. in particular, an all-ocean planet may have a' b'hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.' b'' b"there is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere" b'has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least' b'2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o2 to' b'weathering in the absence of replenishment. no convincing feedback' b'mechanism has been identified. perhaps the reason is the weak' b'anthropic principle: if during the last myr or so, the oxygen' b"level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about" b'it.' b'' b'paul f. dietz'
