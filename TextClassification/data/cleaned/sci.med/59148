b'' b'' b' someone wrote in expressing concern about getting aids from acupuncture' b' needles.....' b'' b'unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who' b'themselves has aids..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get aids' b'from acupuncture needles. generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal' b'immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant' b'involved with acupuncture needle insertion.' b'' b'isn\'t this what hiv is about the "normal immune response" to an exposure?' b'' b'most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away.' b'' b'i had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back. the needles were taken' b'from a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly not' b'sterile or even clean for that matter. more than likely they were fresh' b'from the previous patient. i was concerned, but i kept my mouth shut. i' b'probably should have raised hell!' b'' b'any comments? no excuses.'
