b'' b'' b'' b' i have a simple test. i take several people who can speak' b' only one language (e.g. chinese, russian, german, english).' b' then i let the "gifted one" start "speaking in toungues".' b' the audience should understand the "gifted one" clearly' b' in their native language. however, the "gifted one" can' b' only hear himself speaking in his own language.' b' works everytime. b'' b'this thread si starting to get really silly. such nonsense do not' b'belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on' b'this issue.' b'' b'we chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define' b'our own christianity. we see in parts. if you see something that i do' b'not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on' b'your belief!' b'' b'there is no wonder that your "miracle" does not work. you designet it' b'yourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like' b'the one you describe, i see no reason why your "miracle" should really' b'happen. god is the one who does miracles, not humans!' b'' b'after all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed' b'for the same goal, following different paths. remember that we are' b'going to spend eternity together. if i can not stand your view here on' b'earth, how can i possibly stand spending eternity together with you?' b'' b'tongues is a question of belief. not wether you believe in jesus, but' b'if you believe that he is able to give you this gift. just as any' b'other of the gifts mentioned in the bible. but there is no evidence in' b'the bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way' b'better than others.' b'' b' perhaps i would believe the "gifted ones" more if they were' b" glorifying god rather than themselves. then perhaps we'd" b' witness a real miracle.' b'' b'maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more' b"interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying god, i don't know." b'but if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are' b'faked.' b'' b'in the bible you will find that jesus did not always do miracles. he' b'said that "i do nothing, except what my father tells me." perhaps it' b'woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that' b'example!' b'' b'in him,' b'bjorn' b'--' b'______________________________________________________________________' b's-mail: e-mail:' b'|__ sintef delab' b'| n-7034 trondheim tel: b'|__/|__/|_ norway fax: b'______________________________________________________________________'
