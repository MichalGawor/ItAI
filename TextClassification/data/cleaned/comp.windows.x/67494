b'' b'greetings.' b'' b'i am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively' b'create/edit/view a visual "model" (i.e. topology) of their network, and' b'i was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to' b'simplify this task.' b'' b"in the past i have used visual edge's uim/x product to develop other" b'guis, so i am familiar with uimss in general.' b'' b'the topology will support objects and connecting links. once the' b'topology is created, i want to provide the user with capabilities to' b'support grouping, zooming, etc.' b'' b'i am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than x drawing' b'routines to accomplish this. specifically, the zooming and grouping' b'aspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming, if i have' b'to "roll my own".' b'' b'suggestions?' b'' b'-greg' b''
