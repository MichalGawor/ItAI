(their 'security light' didn't help matters" b"much either.) but i've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of" b'high air traffic. so i know the skies are rarely perfect.' b'' b"but there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't" b"fouled in some way. (i mean they've been trying this forever b"like, concerning tesla's idea to banish night, wow!) i don't watch" b'commercial television, but i can imagine just how disgusting beer,' b'truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.' b"if ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at" b'least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last' b'beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.' b'' b'to be open about this though, i have here my listing of the passage' b'of hst in the evening sky for this weekend tonight friday at' b'8:25 p.m. edt it will reach an altitude of degrees on the' b"local meridian from baltimore vicinity. i'll be trying to see it" b'if i can it _is_ my mealticket after all. so i suppose i could' b'be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky' b'while complaining about billboards proposed by others. be that' b'as it may, i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,' b"even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved." b'' b'regards,' b'wm. hathaway' b'baltimore md'
