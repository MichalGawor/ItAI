b'' b' my main question is the bulb: where can i get uv bulbs? do they' b' need a lot of power? etc., etc.' b'' b'' b'he ones i have seen are all fluorescent tubes. maybe you could find a' b'small tube to go in one of those hand-held fluoro lanterns?' b'' b' one other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-uv' b' light being cheaper to get at than actual uv light. does anyone' b' know what he was referring to?' b'' b'blue lights. ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the' b'spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (x-rays, cosmic rays etc).' b'' b'possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people' b"with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up" b'most of the uv), however since most people use uv to get other things' b"to `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not" b'work as well, if it worked at all.
