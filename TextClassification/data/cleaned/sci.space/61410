b'' b'having read in the past about the fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft, i had' b'assumed that the command loss timer had that sort of function. however i' b'always find disturbing the oxymoron of a "no-op" command that does something.' b'if the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not' b'a "no-op" command.' b'' b'i know its semantics, but the "no-op" _doesn\'t_ do anything. the' b'command loss timer is simply looking for a command, any command. a' b'"no-op" is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the big' b'bit bucket in the sky. "no-op" also get used as timekeepers to provide' b'millisecond delays between command sequences (used on the thruster preps' b'on gro, er, compton) and to verify command links at the beginning of' b'tdrs events. all in all, a rather useful command. and, an intelligent' b'fdc test on galileo (the command loss timer).' b'' b"(still looking for gro data, even though i'm the wrong david)"
