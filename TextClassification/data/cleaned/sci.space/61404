b'' b' does anyone have a reference (something i can look up, not just your own' b' recollections i have a few of those myself) on the temperature of the' b' (night) sky as seen from space?' b'' b' note, i am *not* talking about the temperature of the microwave background' b" radiation. there are more things in the sky than just the mbr; what i'm" b' after is total blackbody temperature what a thermal radiator would see,' b' disregarding (or shielding against) the sun and nearby large warm objects.' b'' b'' b"i'm not sure if this will help you, but the (local) interstellar" b'radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups. if i' b'remember things correctly, the models involved contributions from three' b'different bb sources, so there\'s no obvious "temperature" of background' b'radiation in our local area. however, the following references give the' b'interstellar radiation density as a function of wavelength, and you can' b'integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an "effective"' b'temperature if you like:' b'' b'witt and johnson astrophys. j. b'henry et al. astrophys. j. b'mathis et al. astron. astrophys. b'' b'as you can see, the references are out of date, but they might get you' b'started.' b'' b'hope this helps,' b'' b'julie'
