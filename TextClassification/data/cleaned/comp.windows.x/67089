b'' b'hello netlanders:' b'' b'i am a novice x user with a question for any xgod.' b'' b'my computer configuration with the x problem is as follows:' b'' b'486dx50/256/16ram running esix b'wangtek at-style interface m tape drive.' b'i have loaded the basic os (which includes nsu) and' b'inet utilities (tcp/ip).' b'i ftp-ed the xfree86 (x11r5) binaries and installed properly.' b'' b'i can execute startx and run x-windows with no problems.' b'however, if i try to access the tape drive while in x, the' b'machine locks up instantly. if i am out of x and access the' b'tape, the tape drive works fine. soon as i try to' b'startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background' b'pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked. i have to login' b'from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.' b'' b"i've contacted esix about this problem. they claim their x-window x11r4" b'server (which i have) works with the wangtek tape drive. they also' b"claim i only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run x; i don't" b'need inet (tcp/ip). my experience has been that i need both to get' b"xfree86 to work. i'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet" b'packages to get x to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.' b'' b'i would like to get both x and my tape drive to co-exist on the same' b'system. if you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.' b'' b'one colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict. if this is true,' b'what direction should i look to resolve the conflict b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'at&t bell laboratories' b'263 shuman blvd.' b'naperville, il
