b'' b'hello,' b'' b" i'm investigating the purchase of an object oriented application framework. i have" b'come across a few that look good:' b'zinc' b'----' b' has a platform independent resource strategy. (not too important for me right now)' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'just a thought on resources, it is very important if you do use a' b'multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources. i have' b'used glockenspeil commonview under motif and os2. i wrote a resource' b"converter from os2 to motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially" b'the naming scheme. in motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.' b'with windows you can call the ok button id_ok in every instance,' b"this doesn't work for motif, you'd have to call it dialog1_ok," b'and motif expects a text string rather than a number. so' b'your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the' b'proper resource identifier.' b"i'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does" b'use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to' b'port to. by the way, i would never use commonview or glockenspiel' b'for anything b'' b'' b'' b'alex.' b'' b'' b'--' b'__ alex colburn' b'| image analysis facility' b'| __|\t university of iowa'
