b'' b"here's my analysis of jose canseco, circa sep and jose canseco," b'circa june b'' b"1. he's bulked up too much. period. he needs to lose about pounds," b' not gain more bulk.' b'' b"i've been saying that for at least years now and even the a's conditioning" b'guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help' b"his back.although i don't for one second believe jose used steroids,his" b'back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience' b'because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see jeff' b'bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and imho jose is too big for his' b'frame.' b'' b'' b"2. his bat speed has absolutely vanished. conservatively, i'd say he's" b" lost of his bat speed, and that's a huge amount of speed." b'' b"i can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that" b'jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.' b'' b'' b'3. that open stance is killing him. note that he acts sort of like' b' brian downing way open to start, then closes up as ball is' b' released. downing could do this without significant head movement b" canseco can't. also, note that canseco doesn't always close his" b' stance the same way sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,' b" they're fully closed. without a good starting point, it's hard" b' to make adjustments in your swing.' b'' b"i don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with" b"the a's, and had no problems with it then. it might be that pre-back" b'problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance' b"caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts" b"him. the old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're" b'cold, its a hitch.' b'' b'first, minimize movement before the swing. close and widen the stance,' b'and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing. hopefully, this' b'will cut down on the time i need to swing, and will allow me to move' b'the bathead more freely.' b'' b"the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance he's comfortable" b'with for more than a few months. he changes his stance so much, he loses' b"track of where the strike zone is. in wednesday's night game, he was" b'clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to' b'me. i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because' b"he's changed his stance so much." b'' b"i'm also a bit concerned that because he's got palmer and gonzalez hitting" b"all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw" b"himself up even worse. larussa always said that canseco's famous batting" b'practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged' b'bad hitting habits.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'russ smith' b'*******************************************************************************' b'"i don\'t know anything about x\'s, but i know about some o."' b'george gervin on being an assistant coach' b'********************************************************************************' b'' b'' b'' b''
