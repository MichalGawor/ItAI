b'' b'' b' first of all i never said the holocaust. i said before the' b" holocaust. i'm not ignorant of the holocaust and know more" b' about nazi germany than most people (maybe including you).' b'' b"uh oh! the first sign of an argument without merit--the stating of one's" b'"qualifications" in an area. if you know something about nazi germany,' b"show it. if you don't, shut up. simple as that." b'' b" \ti don't think the suffering of some jews during wwii" b' justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government. any' b' attempt to call civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is' b' not appreciated.' b'' b'all jews suffered during wwii, not just our beloved who perished or were' b'tortured. we all suffered. second, the name-calling was directed against' b'you, not civil-libertarians in general. your name-dropping of a fancy' b'sounding political term is yet another attempt to "cite qualifications"' b'in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument. go' b'back to the minors, junior.'
