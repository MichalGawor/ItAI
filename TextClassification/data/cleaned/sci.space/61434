b'' b'regarding the feasability of retrieving the hst for repair and' b'relaunching it:' b'' b'(caution: speculation mode engaged)' b"there is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet." b"i expect that retrieving hst would involve 'damaging' it considerably in" b'order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay. most of the deployed' b'items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not' b'retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand. they would' b'have to be removed by the astronauts. (the only advantage that this' b"might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due" b'to thermal cycle stresses...)' b'' b'i also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the' b'hst optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are' b'much less so.) can the moveable optical components even be re-caged' b'(i assume that they were caged for launch)?' b'' b'' b'it would be nice if someone here from the hst program was talking instead' b'of all the speculation that is going on here. from what i understand from' b'dr. frank six of the marshall space flight center there is no insrmountable' b'problem in bringing hst back. it was designed that way to begin with.' b'' b'also it is my understanding that the solar arrays will be one of the items' b'replaced on this mission. the originals were built by brit aerospace and' b'i think the new ones are too. i am currently working with the guys at msfc' b'that are in charge is the hst power system, although i have not spoken with' b'them in a long time about hst.' b'' b'dennis, university of alabama in huntsville' b''
