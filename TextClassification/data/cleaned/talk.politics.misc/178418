b'' b'joe,' b'' b'as usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture' b'is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explaining' b'problems in our community. from your post, you apparently find the idea that' b'something is wrong with african americans, value-wise, culture wise or' b'something, very appealing. i never cease to be amazed at how eager non african' b'americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert' b'that something is wrong with us. the socio-economic factors which we know help' b'to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large' b'proportion, i mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we' b'somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is' b'laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. but' b'nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. no, that has' b'socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a' b'dysfunction.' b'' b'basically, i think this tendency for non african americans to believe that' b"something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to" b'deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african' b'americans, and that this is about of the problem. it could not possible be' b'that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has' b'a very effective negative effect on us. no, something is wrong with us.' b'non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they' b'are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good' b'hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. i would get angry if it' b"werent' so damn typical." b'' b'peace aaron'
