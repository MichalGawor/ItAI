b'' b'' b" isn't there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving" b' a non-invasive use of ultra-sound where the patient is lowered' b" into some sort of liquid when he/she undergoes treatment? i'm sure" b" i've read about it somewhere. if i remember it correctly it is a" b' painless and effective treatment.' b' a couple of weeks ago i visited a hospital here in stockholm and' b' saw big signs showing the way to the "kidney stone chrusher" b'' b'i saw this a few years ago on "tomorrow\'s world" (low-brow bbc' b'technology news program). the patient is lowered into a bath of' b'de-ionized water and carefully positioned. high intensity pressure' b"waves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't get" b'electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct). these waves are' b'focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to' b'break up. this is completely painless.' b'' b'of course, you then have to get these little bits of gravel through' b'the urethra. ouch!' b'' b'paul.' b'' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------' b'these ideas and others like them can be had gec-marconi research is not' b'for each from any reputable idealist. responsible for my opinions'
