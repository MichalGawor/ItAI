b'' b'' b'my windows installation has somehow gone awry. whenever i try to run' b'windows now, the logo comes up ok, but when it tries to enter windows' b"itself, the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong" b"graphics mode or something. it's completely illegible although functional" b'as i can still exit to dos with an alt-e return combination.' b'' b'i tried to reinstall windows again, but if you recall, halfway through the' b'installation process, install takes you into windows and there my graphics' b'problem surfaces again so i cannot complete the re-installation.' b'' b'all this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my' b'config.sys and autoexec.bat have been restored to what they were before' b'this problem cropped up.' b'' b"i'm running a 486-33dx with a diamond stealth vram (i've resinstalled the" b"stealth video drivers again but with no luck). i'm also using qemm and" b'stacker but windows is installed on an un-stacked partition. and of' b'course, it worked perfectly before.' b'' b'any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated. thanks.' b'' b'-hutch-' b''
