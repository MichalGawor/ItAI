b'' b'' b'' b' you seem to be a little confused. the socialistic hackers who yell' b' about proprietary software are hardly enamored of motif, which is just' b' as objectionable to that mindset as news is.' b'' b' if i might wear my socialistic hacker hat for a moment, i tar news and' b' motif with the same brush, and that brush is not technical.' b'' b"begging everyone's pardon, i was not slamming motif, nor was i necessarily" b'plugging/flaming the two. i was responding to the sweet blithe statement in:' b'' b'rick this is one area where microsoft nt has a big advantage. since' b'rick they control the whole show, there are no issues like this where' b'rick licensees create incompatible defacto standards.' b'' b'this happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when' b'they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will' b'also be happy to use it. i remember when _sunview_ was hot stuff (and am not,' b'by that statement, endorsing sun and its products, this is just my experience),' b'and when openwindows became hot stuff, that was when i started hearing, as' b'mentioned before, the "socialistic masses" that were bent on destroying' b'_anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including openwindows. i mentioned' b'motif in the same breath, because that is what sun has decided to turn its' b"attention to, not because i hate it. mr. richardson's position, i believe, is" b'a healthy one, and i am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to' b'flame and destroy nt, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be' b'free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are' b'no de facto standards.' b'' b'it was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.' b'' b'mrs. henne' b''
