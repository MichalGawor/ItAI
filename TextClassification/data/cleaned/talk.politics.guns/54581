b'' b'' b'in the videos of the original batf attack on the bd church, did anyone' b"happen to see batf agents on the highest structure, where koresh's" b"room was? i don't recall seeing batf agents higher than the roof of the" b'lowest structures, so i made an assumption that batf helos did the' b'firing down into the tower. any other info on how the rounds came' b'through the roof?'
