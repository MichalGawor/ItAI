b'' b'this week, many of you have asked about my earlier postings on ot, nt and' b'intertestiment exegesis on the homosexual issue. i have refered you to the faq' b'files, which i find out, no longer contains them. they are too long for me to' b'mail to each of you, each article, but will try to get them back on the faq' b'file.' b'' b'because of the renewed interest on this subject, i will type, with permission,' b"an article by james deyoung. i think it is one of the best articles that i've" b"read todate from the conservative position. i can't post it all at once, so it" b"will come piece meal and not daily. after i'm done retyping the entire" b'article, i will make it available for the faq file. talk to clh.' b'' b"also, for those who can't get through to me, you may try one of these:" b'' b'the source and nt meaning' b'of arsenokoitai, with implications' b'for christian ethics and ministry' b'' b'' b'james b. deyoung' b'professor of new testament' b'western conservative baptist seminary' b'portland, oregon' b'' b'traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in cor b'and tim refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex,' b'specifically homosexualitiy. some restrict the term\'s meaning to "active male' b'prostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,' b'namely "homosexuals." more recently the definition "homosexual" has been' b'opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term' b'"homosexuals" is anachronistic. in addition, criticism of the traditional' b'rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes' b'heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals.' b'a concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only' b'factor in the ancient world. the foregoing oppositition to the translation of' b'arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses.' b'finally, this study argues that paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it' b'from the lxx of lev (cf. and using it for homosexual orientation' b'and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline' b'(i cor and legislation in society tim b'' b'*************************************' b'' b'introduction' b'' b'coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has' b'been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or' b'sodomy. as part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used' b'twice by the apostle paul cor i tim has received vigorous' b'scrutiny. this issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since' b'so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements. more particularly,' b'the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church' b'and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.' b'' b'this study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and' b'evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence' b'to point to a resolution. several writers and their positions represent the' b'modern debate on this word. three authors, bailey, boswell, and scroggs, have' b'provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider' b'acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the' b'ministry.' b'' b'' b'footnotes:' b'_______________________' b'1. for convenience sake, the term "homosexual" is used to encompass both' b'same-sex orientation and same-sex behavior. the meaning of this term is one of' b'the main considerations of this study.' b'2. these times are differnt from just over a century ago. then p fairbairn' b'(pastoral epistles [edinburg, could write of arsenokoitai thit it' b'is a "term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent."' b'unknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and' b'study. the present writer endorses the pauline authorship of the pastoral' b'epistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see donald guthrie,' b'new testament introduction, [4th ed; for an extensive' b'discussion and citation of supporters of the pauline authorship).' b'3. for example, see scroggs\' influence on m. olson, "untangling the web," the' b'other side (april for a study suggesting a further prohibition' b'of homosexuality in the ot, see a. phillips, "unconvering the father\'s skirt,"' b'vt (jan, for a bibliography of other sources dealing with' b'arsenokoitai, see the wisondisc religion indexes (ny: h. wison co.,
