b'' b'' b'i have been at a shooting range where' b'gang members were "practicing" shooting.' b'' b'how do "we" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops' b'or even law-abiding menacing minorities. btw why the sneer quotes?' b'' b'"we" know because the area that the gun shop/shooting range is in is right on' b'the border of the west side of chicago. that is a gang infested area. there' b'are many, many bad things going on in that area. also, i have several friends' b'that live very close to that area who have had problems with some of these' b'folks. by the way, where did i say that they were minorities? do you think' b'that only minorities have gangs? not so. as far as the quotes are concerned' b"it was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship. i" b"don't know about you but i have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by" b'taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting. if' b"you would have been there andy it would've been obvious to you too. of course" b'it might not have been. who knows. all i do know is that i was there, i live' b'here and i know that they were gang bangers. when you live here long enough it' b'becomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc. one last' b'thing. my sister is a social worker. she makes it her point to find these' b'things out (gang signs, colors, etc) because it is in her best interest to do' b'so. she is nice enough to let me know these things so i can watch out for' b'myself as i live right on the border of the west side of the city. enough said.' b'' b'jason'
