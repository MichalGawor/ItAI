b'' b'' b'are there traditional' b'signals for slow down!! or go faster!! or i hafta go pee!! etc.???' b'' b'my experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means "slow down".' b'' b'seriously, concentrate on being very smooth, and you will make her' b'experience much more enjoyable. even a normal upshift causes your' b'passenger to bob, so i ease off the throttle before pulling in the' b"clutch to eliminate this. it's more work, but your passenger will" b"appreciate it! also, i've found that using more rear brake than normal" b'helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, which' b"makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on. if you're going" b'sport riding, have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves' b"against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your" b'arms. (again your bike will dive less too)' b'' b'--' b'paul thompson apple computer'
