b'' b'quantum lps240a hard disk phantom seeks' b'' b'i just purchased and installed a 240mb quantum hard drive, model' b'lps240a, and have a concern about its behavior.' b'' b'although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to' b'file i/o, it performs what i call phantom seeks.' b'' b'when the pc is absolutely idle, i can hear a spurt of activity in the' b'drive every seconds, lasting seconds. this activity seems to' b'be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk led never' b'comes on. [the disk led is attached to the disk controller card, not' b'the drive.]' b'' b'my other hard disk, a seagate st3283a, does not have this kind' b'behavior.' b'' b'can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon?' b'' b'--' b'---------------------' b'hpg200/11' b'(408) b'---------------------'
