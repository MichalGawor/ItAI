b'' b'' b"i agree with nick. what's the big deal about long games? if you want" b"to watch baseball, there's that much more baseball to watch. and yes," b'baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.' b'' b"i don't really mind the length of games either. if they want to speed" b"the games up in sensible ways, that's fine with me too. however, what" b'i object to is the assertion by baseball people (whitey herzog, buck' b"rodgers are who i've heard say this) that games are too long because" b'hitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to' b'be expanded.' b'--' b'john franjione' b'department of chemical engineering' b'university of colorado, boulder'
