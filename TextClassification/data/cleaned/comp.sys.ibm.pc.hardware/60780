b'' b'you unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the parity error' b'checking enabled or disabled. i assume you mean it gives you a parity error' b"when it's enabled, and not when it's disabled. how high will the count go on" b'the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs? does the system beep' b"at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps? the error could be occuring in" b'cache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms.' b'' b'the fact that you have ami bios is not conclusive in determining the board' b'manufacturer either. boards are made by thousands of small taiwanese companies' b'(among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some' b'simm sockets to make your board. i tend to doubt your problem is with your' b'ide controller, also.' b'' b'anyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better.' b'' b'mrb' b''
