b'' b'news:' b'=====' b'for the first time all season, the flames are now injury-free. the only player' b'remaining on the limp is center carey wilson who, even when healthy, is not' b'a major part of the team.' b'' b'trent yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season' b'game against san jose. he potted his first of the year in that game, and has' b'also scored goals in both game and game against los angeles.' b'' b'thoughts on game b'==================' b'' b'the flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with' b'los angeles on sunday afternoon. they seemed more interested in throwing' b'big hits than in scoring goals. they physically dominated the kings, but that' b'was the only area they dominated in. the game plan was to rush the net and' b'try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced l.a. defence and the shaky' b'kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the flames' b'conducted a steady march to the penalty box. particularily stupid was theoren' b'fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming warren' b"rychel's face into the dasher while rychel was on his knees." b'' b'goaltender mike vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the' b'loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. he got' b'very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and' b"sweeping away rebounds. in fact, marty mcsorley's goal actually went in off" b"chris dahlquist's skate in front of the net." b'' b'thoughts on game b'==================' b'' b'the flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the' b'potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.' b'the first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the kings. but calgary' b'came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the kings, scoring' b'five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a win.' b'' b'the deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. calgary' b'dominated on faceoffs as they did in game but they were able to make better' b'use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. calgary' b'also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while l.a. only went 1-for-8 and gave up' b"a shorthanded goal to joel otto. l.a.'s powerplay goal also came late in the" b"game with the outcome already decided. the kings' powerplay failed them when" b'they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods.' b'' b'the flames lost rw greg paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he' b"was leveled by alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgary's 7th goal. charlie" b'huddy left the game for the kings with a groin injury.' b'' b'the game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. first, craig berube of' b'calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for' b'instigating when he went after tony granato for no apparent reason. granato' b'drew a minor for some strange reason. (turtling perhaps). this was followed' b'30 seconds later by warren rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct' b'for hitting frank musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a' b'fight. musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. hardy and' b'yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (gregson thought that musil' b'turtling amounted to fighting, but that yawney and hardy throwing punches at' b"each other was just roughing? where's this guy from.....)" b'' b'upcoming games:' b'==============' b'friday april at l.a.' b'sunday april at l.a.' b'tuesday april home to l.a.' b'thursday april at l.a.
