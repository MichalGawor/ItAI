b'' b'' b'' b'i am an ulf (and pgh) fan, and what pisses me off about the whole adam graves/' b'ulf samuesson debate is that ulf plays hard-hitting hockey (nothing wrong with' b'that) while graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to' b'intentionally hurt someone (which bites!).' b'' b"jeesus... i never thought i'd see the day when i defended a ranger...." b'' b"you obviously don't watch much hockey if you think that graves is a" b'goon. he is one of the hardest working rangers (check that-- the' b'hardest working ranger). he had goals this year (not bad for a' b'checking type of player), and showed up for every single game this' b'season (unlike that stiff messier). he is fearless, and throws clean' b'checks. he will also stand up to someone after he hits them, not like' b'that pussy oaf.' b'' b"exactly my point. if you'd watch games more closely, you'd see a lot" b'of goons going after him. ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical' b'players for pgh are left alone. ulf plays rough hockey, but only when' b'other players are putting the rush on mario or jagr. if you want to say anyone' b"on the penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it's jennings or caufield. don'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can't beat the pens" b'even when they take dives (like gartner) to try for the cheap penalties.' b'' b'as for his slash of lemieux, fine. it was a cheap shot. it is the' b'exception, not the rule. i bet you think mike gartner is a goon' b"because of the time that he slashed the hell out of oaf's arm last" b'year, right? after all, he did get a suspension for it...' b'' b"hey, that's fine! if a player does something stupid, he should be penalized" b"including ulf. or mario (you're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter. it's pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon, because you'll see everyone take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you'resomeone who is shadowed as much as ulf is." b'' b'-jpc' b'' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'john p. curcio \t\t go bruins!\t\t philips laboratories' b'(914) \t \t\t briarcliff manor, ny b'' b'' b'' b'********************************************************************************tim drozinski' b'"chew electric death, snarling cur!" spaceman spiff' b''
