the basic organization of the cell and of genetic' b'material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected' b'other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as' b'relates to current computational approaches. dr. noordewier has' b'appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers, and' b'has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition' b'to his

artificial intelligence will be' b'presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological' b'applications. fundamental techniques, symbolic programming' b'languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as' b'selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge' b'representation, inference, and machine learning. the intended' b'audience includes biologists with some computational background,' b'but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence. dr.' b'lathrop, co-developer of ariadne and related technologies, has' b'worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to' b'biological problems in both academia and industry.' b'' b'3:00-5:45pm "neural networks, statistics, and information theory' b'in biological sequence analysis" dr. alan lapedes (los alamos' b'national laboratory)' b'' b'this tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of' b'intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine' b'learning techniques applied to sequence analysis. closely' b'interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical' b'neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general' b'characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such' b'approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic' b'views of sequence data. dr. lapedes, of the theoretical' b'division at los alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such' b'techniques in this domain.' b'' b'3:00-5:45pm "genetic algorithms and genetic programming"' b'prof. john koza (stanford university)' b'' b'the genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly' b'non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally' b'inspired by a biological metaphor. this tutorial will cover both' b'the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and' b'characteristics of the algorithm. genetic programming, an' b'extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size' b'and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will' b'also be addressed. particular attention will be paid to' b'biological applications, and to identifying resources and software' b'that will permit attendees to begin using the methods. dr. koza,' b'a consulting professor of computer science at stanford, has taught' b'this subject since and is the author of a standard text in' b'the field.' b'' b'3:00-5:45pm "linguistic methods in sequence analysis"' b'prof. david searls (university of pennsylvania)' b'& shmuel pietrokovski (weizmann institute)' b'' b'approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies' b'are increasingly in evidence. these involve the adaptation of' b'tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic' b'pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of' b'genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the' b'identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes' b'in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and' b'functional relatedness. dr. searls, who holds research faculty' b'appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn,' b'represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order' b'syntactic approaches to sequence data, while shmuel pietrokovski' b'has studied and published with prof. edward trifinov in the area' b'of word-based analyses.' b'' b'registration form' b'mail, with check made out to "ismb-93", to:' b'' b'ismb conference, c/o j. shavlik' b'computer sciences department' b'university of wisconsin' b'1210 west dayton
