b'' b'hi, i am using a dtk 386-20mhz 13meg memory to run a variety of' b'programs, and have had problems off and on with lock up,' b'but now i am trying to run an application that wants a lot of memory' b'over a period of time (playmation bit rendered) and it is' b'locking up everytime. i have an ati ultra w/2meg which i have' b'tried in each of the video modes, i have excluded the region of' b'video memory from a000-c800 segments from the use of emm386,' b'have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to' b"prevent swapping) and i have rem'd all tsr's and utilities in config.syus" b'and autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling' b'my hp dashboard. even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv,' b"no tsr's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still" b'locks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except' b'3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows' b'screen, but simply does a full reset immediately). just about out' b'of ideas, anyone out there have any???? thanks' b'tom branham'
