b'' b'' b'i was skeptical before the game but was pleasantly surprised at the' b'coverage. i was particularly impressed by the close range camera coverage' b'of work in the corners and behind the play without losing a beat getting' b'back to the puck.' b'' b"thorne is good and i've always been a fan of clement (but i miss" b'mike emrick!). my boyfriend, who is not a hockey fan, even looked up' b'at one point and said, "these guys are pretty good announcers." (this' b'is the same guy who said that rick tocchet looks like charles bronson...:)' b'' b'mom.' b'' b'' b'' b'i have one complaint for the cameramen doing the jersey-pitt series: show' b'the shots, not the hits. on more than one occassion the camera zoomed in' b'on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot. they panned' b"back to show the rebound. maybe mom's camera people were a little more" b'experienced.' b'' b'' b'' b'joseph stiehm' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
