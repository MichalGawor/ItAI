b'' b'' b'i am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the user' b'being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters. also,' b'the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so' b'that they can move around while the user is "exploring" the wireframe' b'world.' b'' b'to do this, i am thinking of using the srgp package described in the' b'van dam, foley and feiner book, but i was wondering if there was' b'another pd graphics package out there which was faster. i would like' b'to make the program as fast as possible so that it provides' b'satisfactory real time performance on a sun ipx.' b'' b"ideally, i'm looking for a pd graphics package which will allow me to" b'open a new window under x, and allow me to draw lines within the' b'window. also, it would also need to have some sort of event driven' b'interaction handling since the user is going to move around the' b'wireframe models using the keyboard.' b'' b'if you know or wrote such a package, i would be grateful if you could' b'direct me to a ftp site which contains the package.' b'' b'thank you.' b'' b'--' b'===============================================================================' b''
