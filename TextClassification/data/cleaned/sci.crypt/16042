b'' b"i'm afraid this doesn't work either. we can pick up laptop screens without any" b'problem. b'' b"i heard somewhere (can't name the source) that tempest does not necessarily" b'pick-up just crts, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip. if' b'that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything' b'on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller. can anybody verify' b'or refute this?' b'' b"yes, that's true. tempest is nothing magic, it's just listening to any" b'available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques' b'you know to separate out the interesting stuff.' b'' b'the nice thing about old crts is that they used to put out lots of' b"signal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully," b'you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked' b'chevy step-van. some brands of electric typewriters were even worse.' b"in both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the" b'user is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is' b'paging out to disk, etc.' b'' b"with newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder to" b'isolate the fun parts. tempest-rated equipment has much lower signal levels.' b'but "everything has vibrations", as master chuan said.' b'--' b'#\t\t\t\tpray for peace; bill' b"#\t no, i'm *from* new jersey, i only *work* in cyberspace...." b'# white house commect line fax
