viewed as hints and suggestions.' b'x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are' b'x allowed. even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.' b'x' b'x you should read the current ioccc rules, prior to submitting entries.' b'x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.' b'x' b'x changes from the draft are noted by change bars. ---\t\t b'x' b'x' b'xwhat is new in b'x' b'x the entry format is better (for us anyway). the program mkentry.c' b'x has been updated. see entry format.' b'x' b'x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c' b'x compiler. certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers' b'x fits are no longer permitted. some of the new issues deal with' b'x non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, c preprocessor' b'x directives and the exit() function. see our likes and dislikes.' b'x' b'x' b'xhints and suggestions:' b'x' b'x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests. see' b'x for more information for details on how to get previous winners.' b'x' b'x keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries' b'x may not be valid entries this year. what was unique and novel one year' b"x might be 'old' the next year." b'x' b'x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways. we typically apply' b'x a number of tests to an entry:' b'x' b'x\t* look at the original source' b'x\t* convert ansi tri-graphs to ascii' b"x\t* c pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines" b"x\t* c pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines" b'x\t* run it through a c beautifier' b'x\t* examine the algorithm' b'x\t* lint it' b'x\t* compile it' b'x\t* execute it' b'x' b'x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.' b'x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been' b"x 'cleaned up' by the c pre-processor and a c beautifier." b'x' b'x your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests. in certain' b'x cases, a test is not important. entries that compete for the' b"x 'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as" b'x others in terms of their algorithm. on the other hand, given' b'x two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that' b'x does something interesting when you run it.' b'x' b'x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules. as such, we leave' b'x the contest open for creative rule interpretation. as in real life' b'x programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request' b"x is important. for this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the" b"x rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way." b'x' b'x if you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know' b'x in the remarks section. please note that an invitation to abuse' b'x is not an invitation to break. we are strict when it comes to the' b'x byte size limit. also, abusing the entry format tends to' b'x annoy more than amuse.' b'x' b'x we do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries' b"x to attempt to exploit them. we will award 'worst abuse of the rules'" b'x and then plug the hole next year. even so, we will attempt to use' b'x the smallest plug needed, if not smaller. b'x' b'x check out your program and be sure that it works. we sometimes make' b'x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly' b'x in or near the final round. on the other hand, we have seen some' b"x of the best entries fall down because they didn't work." b'x' b'x we tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that' b'x is a prime number. if you do have a bug, you are better off' b'x documenting it. noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power' b'x of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry. and sometimes,' b'x a strange bug/feature can even help the entry! of course, a correctly' b'x working entry is best.' b'x' b'x' b'xour likes and dislikes:' b'x' b"x doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'. we" b"x tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests" b"x that we apply. simply abusing #defines or -dfoo=bar won't go as far" b'x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.' b'x' b'x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:' b'x' b'x\t#define d define' b"x\t#d foo\t\t don't expect this to turn into #define foo" b'x' b'x\tint i;' b"x\tj;\t\t don't use such implicit type declaration" b'x\tint k;' b'x' b'x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler. if you' b'x must use non-ansi c, such as k&r c, you must avoid areas that result in' b'x compile/link errors for ansi c compilers.' b'x' b'x unfortunately, some ansi c compilers require array indexes to be of b'x integral type. thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should b'x not be used in this rule may be relaxed in future contests.\t b'x' b'x\tint i;' b'x\tchar *c;' b'x\ti[c];\t\t use c[i] instead' b'x\t(i+3)["string"]; use "string"[i+3] instead' b'x' b'x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of' b'x arguments, be careful. systems implement va_list as a wide variety' b'x of ways. because of this, a number of operations using va_list are' b'x not portable and must not be used:' b'x' b'x\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable' b'x\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable' b'x\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg' b'x\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg' b'x\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables' b'x\t* using va_list as a structure or union' b'x' b"x in particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s." b'x' b'x avoid using <varargs.h, use <stdarg.h instead.' b'x' b'x if you use c preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, b"x the leading must be the first character on a line. while some" b"x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not." b'x' b'x because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries' b'x must not assume that it returns an int.' b'x' b'x small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.' b'x while such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do' b'x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people' b'x attempt to completely understand. for this reason, we look for' b'x programs that are compact, and are instructional.' b'x' b'x one line programs should be short one line programs, say around b'x bytes long. getting close to bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.' b'x' b'x we tend to dislike programs that:' b'x' b'x\t* are very hardware specific' b'x\t* are very os or un*x version specific' b'x\t (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific' b'x\t code is likely not to be)' b'x\t* dump core or have compiler warnings' b"x\t (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)" b"x\t* won't compile under both bsd or sys v un*x" b'x\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit' b'x\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri-graphs' b'x\t* are longer than they need to be' b'x\t* are similar to previous winners' b'x\t* are identical to previous losers b'x' b'x unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the' b"x 'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program" b'x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.' b'x' b'x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size' b"x limit. it is one thing to make use of a several -d's to help out," b"x but it is quite another to use bytes of -d's in order to" b'x try and squeeze the source under the size limit. you should feel' b'x free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off' b'x if you show some amount of restraint.' b'x' b'x we allowed whitespace, and in certain cases or do not impact' b'x your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get' b'x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.' b'x' b'x given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob' b'x of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical c' b'x program, we tend to favor the second version. of course, a third' b'x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting' b'x and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!' b'x' b"x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'" b'x program. we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim' b'x to be the smallest. there is nothing wrong with self-replicating' b'x programs. in fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.' b"x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)" b'x know of a smaller one!' b'x' b'x x client entries should be as portable as possible. entries that' b"x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. don't" b"x depend on a particular type of display. for example, don't depend" b"x on color or a given size. don't require backing store." b'x' b'x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and' b'x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x client' b'x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the' b'x athena widget set (libx11.a, libxaw.a, libxmu.a and libxt.a).' b"x don't use m*tif, xv*ew, or openl*ok toolkits, since not everyone" b'x has them. avoid depending on a particular window manager. not' b'x everyone has x11r5, and some people are stuck back in x11r4 (or' b'x earlier), so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5. better' b'x yet, try to make your entry run on all version x window systems.' b'x' b'x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on' b'x .xdefaults. if you must do so, be sure to note the required lines' b'x in the ---remark--- section.' b'x' b'x we like programs that:' b'x' b'x\t* are as concise and small as they need to be' b'x\t* do something at least quasi-interesting' b'x\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)' b'x\t* are portable' b'x\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style' b'x\t* make use of a number of different types of obfuscation' b'x\t* make us laugh and/or throw up b'x' b"x some types of programs can't excel in some areas. of course, your" b"x program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several" b'x areas really does help.' b'x' b'x we freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in' b'x the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning. if you had to' b'x read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.' b'x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well.' b'x' b'x be creative!' b'x' b'x' b'xentry format:' b'x' b'x in order to help us process the many entries, we must request
