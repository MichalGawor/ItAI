b'' b'' b'' b"one more way, which works in manual trans cars i've driven, and it is my" b'personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this' b'one, too).' b'' b'while pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out' b'slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into' b"position. if you do it right, the car won't jump backward, nor will the" b'gears grind.... you will just glide back.' b'' b'-sam' b'' b'i can vouch for this method in my sho. this is the only sure way of' b'putting in the reverse without any problem _every_ time.' b'' b'vikas sontakke\t\tdigital equipment corporation, maynard ma.' b'uucp:\t\t{decvax,ucbvax,allegra}!decwrl!helix.enet!sontakke'
