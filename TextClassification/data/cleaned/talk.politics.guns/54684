of the firearms-politics mailing list, karl kleinpaste,' b'has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for rkba' b'related information. this directory can be used for things like' b'articles by kates, wright, tonso, levinson, supreme court decisions,' b"the ria vs us decision, copies of legislation, and so on. it's not" b'meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.' b'' b"so, in the future if you're looking for something check there first" b'and then ask here.' b'' b'instructions:' b'' b'short version for techies:' b'' b'the site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu. place contributions into the' b'directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba. the ftp commands' b'get, put, mget, or mput should work. give the command "type binary"' b'to be sure files are transferred correctly. your files will be moved' b'to the rkba directory. to get a file use the commands get or mget.' b'' b'i will maintain an index which you should get first to check if' b'the file you want to read or write already is archived.' b'' b'long version for non-techies:' b'' b'in order for you to use this archive your computer must be on' b'the internet. to connect to the archive site run the command:' b'' b'ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu' b'' b"if that doesn't work you cannot use this archive. if the ftp" b"command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a" b'login:' b'name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):' b'' b'instead of lvc your initials will appear. answer this prompt with:' b'' b'ftp' b'' b"next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:" b'' b'guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:' b'' b'i would enter:' b'' b'' b"you'll enter your own e-mail address. you'll get these lines" b'or similar as output:' b'' b'remote system is unix.' b'using binary mode to transfer files.' b'' b'next, the command prompt is printed:' b'' b'ftp' b'' b'if you do not get the line "using binary mode to transfer files."' b'run the command:' b'' b'type binary' b'' b"now you're logged in to the archive machine. there are many" b'directories on this machine but the two you are concerned with are' b'' b'/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba' b'and' b'/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming' b'' b'there are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.' b'' b'when you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon. to retreive' b'files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:' b'' b'cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba' b'or' b'cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba' b'' b'to submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with' b'the command:' b'' b'cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming' b'or' b'cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming' b'' b"once you do this you'll get another ftp prompt asking you to enter" b'another command.' b'' b'to find the names of the existing files in the directory you are' b'in run the command:' b'' b'ls -l' b'' b'this will produce something like:' b'' b'total b'-r--r--r-- karl jun dmn_gratia_ccp' b'-r--r--r-- karl apr index' b'-r--r--r-- karl jun knox_aw_lies' b'-r--r--r-- karl apr s361' b'-r--r--r-- karl jun wsj_crimestrike' b'-r--r--r-- karl jan academia-bias' b'-r--r--r-- karl mar academics' b'-r--r--r-- karl aug aclu' b'... and so on b'' b'each line corresponds to one file. reading right to left, the fields' b'are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of' b'the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need' b'to be concerned with.' b'' b'to get a file run the command "get" followed by the name of the file' b'you want, for example:' b'' b'get index' b'or' b'get noduty' b'' b'after the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:' b'' b'transfer complete.' b'19580 bytes received in seconds kbytes/s)' b'' b'you can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.' b'you can use the mget command to retreive multiple files. if the' b'file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/hr1025' b'you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first' b'and then retrieve it:' b'' b'cd congress/103rd' b'get hr1025' b'' b"once you're finished you can log off with the command:" b'' b'quit' b'' b'if you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little' b'different. first of all you should find out if the file already' b'exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above' b"and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry. the" b'index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba' b'directory. for example:' b'' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'file: whitemanslaw' b'' b"white man's law by william r. tonso, from the december b'reason magazine' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b"once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login" b'and change to the incoming directory command (see above). once' b'you are in the incoming directory use the command:' b'' b'put file_name' b'' b'in this case:' b'' b'put whitemanslaw' b'' b'again there\'ll be a "transfer complete, so many bytes transfered' b'in so many seconds" message. now your file is on the archive' b'machine.' b'' b'another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/. be sure' b"there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same" b"as the file you want to write. if you use the same name you'll" b"overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message]." b'' b'your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a' b'file by the same name in the rkba directory.' b'' b'once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for' b'the index file and i will add it to the file.' b'' b'if you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute' b"a file email the file to me and i'll take care of the rest." b'' b'if you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so' b'be sure to let me know first.' b'' b'if you have any questions feel free to ask me.' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'--' b'' b'' b'' b''
