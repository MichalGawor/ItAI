b'' b' i had asked everyone about problems installing a meg' b' simm and an meg simm in my centris but the folks at the' b' local apple store called the folks in cupertino and found that' b" you can't have simms of different speeds in one machine, even" b' if they are both fast enough ie my ns meg and 60ns b' meg simms were incompatibable... just thought people might' b' want to know.....' b'' b"there's absolutely no reason why differences in the dram access time" b'_alone_ would cause an incompatibility. there would have to be another' b"difference between the simms for there to be a problem. i've often used" b"memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever. as long as it's" b'as fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine.' b'' b'just out of curiosity, did you actually try this and see a problem, or' b"were you told it wouldn't work and so never tried it? also out of" b'curiosity, do you know exactly who in cupertino you dealer talked to (as' b"i'd like to find out what they're basing this recommendation on)." b'' b'- dale adams' b'apple computer, inc.'
