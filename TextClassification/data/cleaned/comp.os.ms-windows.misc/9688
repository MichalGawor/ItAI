b'' b'' b'we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using' b'w4wg for a while now. we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail' b'package so we got the smtp gateway. you also need a tcp/ip transport' b"package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they" b'require to get the smtp gateway to work. you need a dedicated pc' b'for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another' b'dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff. we do not have the remote mail' b'going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.' b'' b"there is a glitch somewhere in the system though. i don't know if it" b'is ms mail, the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the' b'mail that is sent. the scenario is this. the outgoing mail goes to a' b'unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go. if that mail' b'is routed to the vax, the vax has problems some times receiving the mail.' b'most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail' b'on the vax forwarded to some other location. that is the main gotcha.' b'where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header' b'then a message saying "boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)". if you' b'can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok. the system people' b'of course say that the vax is not the problem, the gateway is probably' b'the problem. if anyone wants to get help it is only for one' b'support call. (until problem is worked out) phooey to that i say. i' b'am looking vigorously for a better idea.' b'' b'if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew, please' b'drop me a note anyone. the next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ip' b'built in they say........ the netxt itteration of w4wg' b'' b'good luck!!!!!' b'' b'*******************************************************************' b'utah state university' b'cooperative extension' b'systems specialist' b'umc voice: b'logan, ut fax: b'*******************************************************************' b''
