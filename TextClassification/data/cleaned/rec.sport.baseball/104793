b'' b'just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the dodgers (one of' b'my least favorite) in la (sweet!). also the mets (my other least' b'favorite team) loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a' b'great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight.' b'' b'big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be' b'hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots' b'of hits and not many runs. hopefully with the coaches stress on' b'situational hitting in spring training, the runners lob will be lower' b'this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and' b"lankford and zeile's off year)." b'' b"i don't know why all the fuss about the fillies. the media and all the" b'filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.' b'give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games' b"and we'll see who is in first then. i believe the cardinal pitching" b'staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the' b'difference.' b'' b'on a side note, a few years ago a comment was made by some' b'baseball player or manager about the dodger defense. he was asked' b'where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied "fair." i' b'remember it being in the "they said it" section of sports illustrated.' b'i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.' b'' b'go redbirds!!' b'' b'gary wieman'
