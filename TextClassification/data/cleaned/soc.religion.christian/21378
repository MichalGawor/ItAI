b'' b'somewhere, someone told me that satan was the angel in charge of' b'music in heaven, and on top of that, he was the most beautiful' b"of the angels. isn't it funny that these days how mtv has become" b'the "bible" of music and beauty these days. mtv controls what bands' b'are popular, no matter how bad they are. in fact, it is better to' b'be politically correct like u2, madonna than to have any' b'musical talent. then of course, you have this television station' b'that tells us all how to dress. think about it, who started the' b'retro-fashion craze?? mtv and madonna. gag.' b'' b'anyway, just food for thought. it is really my own wierd theory.' b'' b'if revelation was to come true today, i think mtv would the "ever' b'changing waters" (music and fashion world) that the beast would' b'arise from, and madonna will be the whore of babylon, riding the' b'beast and drinking the blood of the martyrs.' b'' b'hmmmm....great idea for a book/movie.....' b'' b'' b'--' b"steven c. salaris we're...a lot more dangerous than live crew" b'we have ideas. we have a philosophy.' b'geoff tate queensryche'
