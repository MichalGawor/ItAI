b'' b'' b' also, perihelions of gehrels3 were:' b' b' april jupiter radii' b' august jupiter radii' b' b' where jupiter radius km mi au. so the' b' figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.' b' is that the case for the figure as well?' b' b" sorry, _perijoves_...i'm not used to talking this language." b'' b'hmmmm.... the prefix "peri-" is greek, not latin, so it\'s usually used' b"with the greek form of the name of the body being orbited. (that's why" b'it\'s "perihelion" rather than "perisol", "perigee" rather than "periterr",' b'and "pericynthion" rather than "perilune".) so for jupiter i\'d expect it' b'to be something like "perizeon".) b'' b'___ bob' b'/__) b'robert k. coe churchill st, sudbury, massachusetts
