b'' b'| as i announced at the x technical conference in january, i would like' b'| to' b'| make imake-tex, the imake support for using the tex typesetting system,' b'| publically available. currently imake-tex is in beta test here at the' b'| computer science department of dortmund university, and i am looking' b'| for' b'| some more beta testers, preferably with different tex and imake' b'| installations.' b'' b'judging from the responses so far, i have not made clear enough in my' b'article quoted above that imake-tex is not for installing tex, but for' b'*using* it. with imake-tex, you will never again have to fiddle around with' b'calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). simply' b'type "make" and your document\'s dvi file will be up-to-date. all you have' b'to do is to write a simple imakefile and let imake generate a suitable' b'makefile for you. here is such an imakefile:' b'' b'#include "tex.tmpl"' b'paperformata4()' b'simplelatextarget(document)' b'' b'the generated makefile provides the following commands:' b'' b'make depend: searching the tex source files for dependencies like' b'\\input{somefile}' b'' b'make dvi: generate an up-to-date dvi file' b'' b'make viewdvi: display it on your screen' b'' b'make ps: generate a postscript version of your document' b'' b'make viewps: display it' b'' b'make clean: remove unnecessary things' b'' b'make veryclean: remove even the dvi file' b'' b'make makefiles: generate makefiles in subdirectories' b'' b'' b'if b'' b'a) ...this seems attractive to you,' b'b) ...you are willing to test imake-tex and send me a short test report,' b'c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary english documentation' b'(however, the german version is completed and included),' b'' b'then you are invited as a beta tester. i am looking forward to your e-mail.' b'' b'--' b'dipl.-inform. rainer klute i r b immer richtig beraten' b'univ. dortmund, irb' b'postfach tel.: b'd-w4600 dortmund fax b'' b'new address after june 30th: univ. dortmund, d-44221 dortmund'
