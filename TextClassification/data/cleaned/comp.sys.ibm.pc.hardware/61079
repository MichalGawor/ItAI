b'' b'' b'also, dblspace is crap. it writes about slower than stacker, reads about' b'20% slower, and compresses about less. all tests were made on the same' b'computer with the same disk, no cache, and the same (big) files were used.' b'' b"couldn't agree more. on my i don't miss the speed. it's still" b'faster than a normal disk read would be. as for the less compression,' b'' b'koberg' b'' b'i recall reading a review article in pc computing wherein they reported' b'a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using stacker b'this was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the fact' b'that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. does' b'anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of stacker' b'and dblspace?' b'' b'bs' b''
