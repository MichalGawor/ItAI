b'' b'' b'' b'[h] \tthe armenians in nagarno-karabagh are simply defending their rights' b'[h] to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are invading their' b'[h] territorium...' b'' b'[he]\thomeland? first nagarno-karabagh was armenians homeland today' b'[he]\tfizuli, lacin and several villages (in azerbadjan)' b"[he]\tare their homeland. can't you see the" b'[he]\tthe "great armenia" dream in this?' b'' b'greater armenia would stretch from karabakh, to the black sea, to the' b'mediterranean, so if you use the term "greater armenia" use it with care.' b'' b'[he] with facist methods like' b'[he]\tkilling, raping and bombing villages. the last move was the' b'[he]\tblast of a truck with kurdish refugees, trying to' b'[he]\tescape the from lacin, a city that was "given" to the kurds' b'[he]\tby the armenians.' b'' b'it has always been up to the azeris to end their announced winning of karabakh' b'by removing the armenians! when the president of azerbaijan, elchibey, came to' b'power last year, he announced he would be be "swimming in lake sevan [in' b'armeniaxn] by july". well, he was wrong! if elchibey is going to shell the' b'armenians of karabakh from aghdam, his people will pay the price! if elchibey' b'is going to shell karabakh from fizuli his people will pay the price! if' b'elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing armenia from the hills of' b'kelbajar, his people will pay the price.' b'' b'it also seems other non-azeri minorities in azerbaijan have understood they' b'are next in line in this process of forced azerification or deportation. just' b'look at the situation with the lezgians.' b'' b'about the kurds...what kurds! according to the azerbaijani government, there' b"are no kurds in azerbaijan. can't they make up their minds? oh i see, there" b'are only kurds when the azeris want them to be kurds! and anyway, this b'kurd refugee" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in' b'baku, modified in ankara. other examples of this are armenia has no border' b'with iran, and the ridiculous story of the "intercepting" of armenian military' b'conversations as appeared in the new york times supposedly translated by' b'somebody unknown, from armenian into azeri turkish, submitted by an unnamed' b'"special correspondent" to the ny times from baku. real accurate!' b'' b'[h] however, i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane' b'[h] to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one' b'[h] that happened last summer. turkey searched an american plane' b'[h] (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to armenia.' b'[h]' b'' b'no, henrik, these turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.' b'' b"[he]\tdon't speak about things you don't know: american cargo planes" b'[he]\twere heading to armenia. when the turkish authorities' b'[he]\tannounced that they were going to search these cargo' b"[he]\tplanes of these planes returned to it's base in germany." b'[he]\t5 of these planes were searched in turkey. the content of' b'[he]\tof the other planes? not hard to guess, is it? it was sure not' b'[he]\thumanitarian aid.....' b'' b'your "facts" in error. shipments of all kinds that have transversed turkey' b'have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. some american planes' b'were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. rail shipments' b'were held up last fall and last winter from entering armenian from turkey' b'for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of armenia. wheat was' b'confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with "crap" and dirt, then' b"shipped to armenia. u.s. planes don't have to use turkish air bases. the u.s." b'uses these bases to bomb iraq. anyway, u.s. planes can fly over georgia, which' b'they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of turkish' b'chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed' b'anything other than a paranoid turkish military.' b'' b"[he]\tsearch turkish planes? you don't know what you are talking about." b"[he]\tsince it's content is announced to be weapons?" b'' b'well, big mouth ozal said military weapons are being provided to azerbaijan' b'from turkey, yet demirel and others say no. no wonder you are so confused!' b'' b"[he]\tturkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons" b'[he]\tto azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan' b'[he]\tit self, not the karabag province. so why search a plane for weapons' b"[he]\tsince it's content is announced to be weapons?" b'' b'you are correct, all turkish planes should be simply shot down! nice, slow' b'moving air transports!' b'' b'' b'--' b"s.d.p.a. center for regional studies the armenian border, when we can't" b'p.o. box even explain b'cambridge, ma turkish mp, march
