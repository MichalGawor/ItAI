b'' b'' b'i just bought a little gizmo that is supposed to be installed "in' b'series with the tip or ring lines" of the phone wire. which ones are' b'those? suppose i am holding a regular phone wire, such that the little' b'plastic tooth (on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead' b'ends that you plug into the phone) is facing down, and away from me.' b'which of the wires that i see is the "tip" and which is the "ring"?' b'' b'mike levin' b'' b'mike, ring is the red wire. tip is the green wire of most standard' b'phone lines. they two constitute the two wires most often used for' b'voice telephone (the two live lines). they are the two innermost' b'connectors of an rj-11 phone jack.' b'' b'another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from red to' b'green (ring to tip. tip/green being at ground potential of the' b'voltmeter), it should read volts in the on-hook no-ring position).' b"i am sure it's v and not volts. doesn't hurt a phone too" b"much if they're reversed, it's just bad if one happens to somehow get" b'grounded to earth ground elsewhere).' b'' b'additionally, when off-hook, the voltage drops to about to volts' b'dc. i think it is supposed to correspond to a to ma current' b'loop. and lastly, when ringing, the two wires develop an ac potential' b'of about v p-p at to hz across them (where you get the' b'electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).' b'' b'hope that clears things...' b'' b'' b''
