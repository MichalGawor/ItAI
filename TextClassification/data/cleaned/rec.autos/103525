b'' b'| anyone else experiencing a similar problem?' b'|' b'| this concerns the clutch on a honda accord speed. when the clutch' b'| is first used in the morning, about the first miles of shifting, there' b'| is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up. then the' b'| clutch shifts smoothly. this chatter started when i moved to the san' b'| francisco bay area from a low-humidity environment. the dealer stated' b'| that this is known to happen since honda changed from an asbestos to' b'| non-asbestos clutch material. no remedy!! seems that moisture on clutch' b'| surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates.' b'|' b'| any comments out there?' b'' b"the clutch on my honda civic ex-v (ex in the u.s.) does this too." b"it's annoying. now that i think about, it _is_ worse when the humidity is" b"high. the dealer also claims there's nothing they can do since the clutch is" b'a "self-adjusting hydraulic design". yeah, right.' b'' b'' b"one of the reasons i sold my civic vx was the chattery-grabby clutch" b"although i din't notice it being any worse in humid weather, perhaps because" b'its always humid around here. i was told by honda that it has to do with' b'changing from asbestos to non-asbestos linings, which began around b"someone could make some good money selling the old-fashion variety if it's" b'legal to manufacture them these days. my feeling is that since many other' b"car makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineering" b'problem on the part of honda. three things to look out for on all honda' b'products clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.' b''
