b'' b'well, after days of hearing that of the bd bodies had' b'been shot in the head (horrors! another jonestown! crazed' b'cultists! child abusers! whackos in waco!), last night the' b'medical examiner was on tv and was pretty vehement in denying' b'that any of them had bullet wounds... he seemed just a tad upset' b'at the feds for having spread that rumor.' b'' b'funny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no' b'evidence one way or another that there were bullet wounds b'not a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are' b'deemed speculative. including reports that there were no' b'bullet wounds.' b'' b'before long, i think all the kneejerk government apologists' b'are going to start getting pretty pissed off at how easily' b'they were misled.' b'' b'before long, i think all the kneejerk conspiracy theorists' b'are going to start getting pretty pissed off at how easily' b'they mislead themselves. also, pretty disappointed at' b'being ignored by the coutnry.' b'' b'--' b'| the koresh cult standoff is over may his victims recquiescat in pace b'| b'| (the above is a net.moment of silence)
