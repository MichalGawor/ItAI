b'' b': i have seen the existance of electronics solder with a silver' b': content that seems to have good wetting and fatique reatings.' b': can anyone tell me why it is not used? (silver is not such an expensive' b': metal).' b':' b':' b': andy' b':' b'' b'for the most part, silver-solder is not used for general soldering' b'tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth. silver-solder, when' b'exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field, will actually' b'grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically' b'short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field. for this' b'reason, silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies.' b'fortunatly, tin-lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites' b'as fast as silver-solder. therefore, it is used extensively.' b'' b'' b'jerry long' b'' b'****************************************' b'disclaimer.... opinions are my own and' b'do not reflect those of my employer.' b'****************************************'
