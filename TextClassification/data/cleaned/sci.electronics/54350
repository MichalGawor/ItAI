b'' b'\tjust a quick question. what standard lab solvents can be used to' b'clean electronic equipment and components safely (ie not corrode, dissolve,' b'short-out, etc the equipment)?' b'\twater?\t:-)' b'\tmethanol?' b'\tccl4?' b'' b'you don\'t say what kind of "electronic equipment" you mean. it\'s hard' b"to give a generic answer. there is essentially no solvent that won't" b'do things like washing lubricant out of switches.' b'' b"when we've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things, we've just" b'used distilled water. the key thing to remember is to make sure the gear' b'is *completely* dry before powering it up again. we let it dry for' b'several days to be damn sure.' b'' b'i doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water. i would' b'be very wary of ccl4, not least because it is dangerous to *you* even' b"if it's not going to harm the equipment not only is it poisonous," b"but i believe it's now known to be carcinogenic." b'--'
