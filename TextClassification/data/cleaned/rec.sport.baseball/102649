b'' b"i've said the braves would improve by injury as well. here's how." b'' b'javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson.' b'ryan klasko is a better firstbaseman than bream.' b' chipper jones is a better shortstop than anyone the braves' b' put out there.' b'' b'mel nieves is better than nixon/sanders.' b'' b"that's how. it forces them to play the young guys." b'' b'- bob gaj' b'' b' i continue to be amazed at these comments. while lopez might *some' b' day* be a better catcher than olson, i find it totally amazing for' b' you to suggest that this year-old with three seasons of professional' b' baseball is *now* better than olson, a five-year mlb veteran who is' b' noted for his ability to call a game, and who has a better-than-average' b' arm. oh, perhaps you are talking about hitting. well, sure, lopez' b' *might* hit better. perhaps he *probably* will.' b'' b' but has there ever in the history of baseball been a 22-year-old (or' b' younger) *rookie* catcher who compared favorably among all league' b" catchers in terms of defense and brought a bat? wasn't it" b'' b'yes, ivan rodriguez, last year. batted and threw out of the' b'baserunners. not too shabby for a rookie from aa. years old last' b'year.' b'' b' sandy alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year?' b" not. wasn't it benito santiago who was supposed to be that good" b' in his rookie year? not.' b'' b' i can continue this thread with the others mentioned, but you get' b' the point. you and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the' b' seasoned veterans in favor of the hot *young* rookies. perhaps b' just perhaps the management team of the pennant-winning braves' b' knows something more than you do. and perhaps what they know is' b' that very, very few and 22-year old rookies come up to the majors' b' and make an impact.' b'' b'' b' --\tthe beastmaster' b'' b'' b'' b' b' mark singer' b'--' b'roy f. cabaniss......................*wait till tommy meets the lord and' b"western kentucky university..........*finds out that he's wearing pinstripes." b'all opinions contained herein........*gaylord perry (talking about lasorda)' b"are all mine own, and that's the sin.*baseball, what a way to spend a day!!"
