you only buy the packages your" b'particular application/interest calls for.' b'' b'each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from' b'a common "parameter file" which must be (in vms anyway) in your "default' b'directory." some utilities will share parameters and use the same' b'parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting' b'up a series of operations. the standard pci environment contains a' b'scripting language very similar to ibm-pc basic, but which allows you to' b'automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,' b'lengthy or difficult series of utility executions. (in vms i can also' b"invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure.) there's" b'also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled' b'language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the pci' b'data structures (database file, parameter file).' b'' b'the pci software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but' b'requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the' b'level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle' b'a few other things as well. for instance, the tape i/o package offers a' b'utility for reading headerless multi-band (what adobe photoshop on the' b'macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different' b'"interleave" orders. this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the' b'graphic-arts industry\'s "ct2t" format, would probably (i haven\'t tried)' b'handle targa, and so on. above all, however, you have to know what' b"you're doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start" b'over. it\'s worth noting that the pci "database" file is designed to' b'contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map' b'information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of' b'other information (i observe that a remote-sensing image tape often' b'contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,' b'longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this' b'can go into the pci "database").' b'' b'i _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used. on vax' b'systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific' b'third-party display systems (the name gould/deanza seems to come to' b'mind). one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would' b'display directly from a pci "database" file to a peritek vct-q (q-bus' b'24-bit directcolor) display subsystem. pci software could be "overkill"' b'in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"' b"applications/users, i.e. those for whom a mac/pc largely doesn't suffice" b"(although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time). it's" b'probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada, a country which' b'does a lot of its land/resource management via remote sensing; i believe' b'the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these' b'areas.' b'' b'spam (spectral analysis manager)' b'--------------------------------' b'back in jpl developed something called spam (spectral analysis' b'manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time. that was designed' b'for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery (byte data, pixels' b'across by lines by bands); a modified version has since' b'been developed for aviris (airborne visual and infrared imaging' b'spectrometer) which uses much larger images.' b'' b'spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, pc and' b'ihs transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).' b'actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement' b'(stretching). spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.' b'' b'the original spam uses x or sunview to display. the aviris version may' b'require vicar, an executive based on tae, and may also require a frame' b"buffer. i can refer you to people if you're interested. pcw requires x" b'for display.' b'' b'map ii' b'------' b'among the mac gis systems, map ii is distributed by john wiley.' b'' b'clrview' b'-------' b'clrview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit' b'the real-time capabilities of silicon graphics iris computers.' b'' b'this program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the' b'visualization of information from cad and gis sources. it supports' b'the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as dxf,' b'tin, dem, lattices, and arc/info coverages among others.' b'' b'clrview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca b'in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.' b'' b'contact:' b'rodney hoinkes' b'head of design applications' b'centre for landscape research' b'university of toronto' b'tel: b'' b'==========================================================================' b'' b'end of resource listing' b'--' b'nick (nikolaos) fotis national technical univ. of athens, greece' b'halandri, gr uucp: mcsun!ariadne!theseas!nfotis' b'athens, greece fax:
