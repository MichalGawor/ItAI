b'' b'i am getting garbled output when serial printing thru windows works' b'etc. this has occurred on several systems and goes if a laserjet is' b'used. i suspect that there is no need for handshaking in this case due' b'to the capacity (memory/speed) of it. there is no problem printing from' b"dos. are there any obvious tweaks i'm missing. i'm sure its not just" b'me with this problem. thanks for reading.... john atherton' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
