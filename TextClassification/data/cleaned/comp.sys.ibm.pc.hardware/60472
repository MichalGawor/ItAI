b'' b' anybody seen the date get stuck?' b'' b" i'm running ms-dos with a menu system alive all the time. the machine" b' is left running all the time.' b'' b' suddenly, the date no longer rolls over. the time is (reasonably) accurate' b' allways, but we have to change the date by hand every morning. this involves' b' exiting the menu system to get to dos.' b'' b' anyone have the slightest idea why this should be? even a clue as to whether' b' the hardware (battery? cmos?) or dos is broken?' b'' b'i bet it suddenly started sticking when you started leaving the pc running the' b'menu all night. there is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in' b"pc's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input" b'via a dos call rather than a bios call (as menus often use) otherwise the code' b'to update the date after midnight never gets called.' b'' b"somebody might be able to correct the details in case i've mis-rememberred" b'them, but i think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)' b'or add a tsr or system patch or something. as far as i know the cmos clock' b"keeps the right time (in fact about seconds/day better than dos's clock)." b'' b'mark aitchison, university of canterbury.'
