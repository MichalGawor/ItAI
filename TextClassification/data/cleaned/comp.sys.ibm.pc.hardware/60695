b'' b'i just installed a dx2-66 cpu in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a cpu' b'cooler on the chip. after about hour, the weight of the cooler was enough' b'to dislodge the cpu from its mount. it ended up bending a few pins' b'on the cpu, but luckily the power was not on yet. i ended up' b'pressing the cpu deeply into its socket and then putting the cpu' b'cooler back on. so far so good.' b'' b'have others had this problem? how do you ensure that the weight of' b'the cpu fan and heatsink do not eventually work the cpu out of its' b'socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?' b'' b'--'
