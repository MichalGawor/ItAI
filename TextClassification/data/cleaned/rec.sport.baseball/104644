b'' b'' b"a reasonable umpire would do as he's been instructed to do this season: get" b'the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous' b'length of games. i for one am glad to see this happen, and hope more' b'umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if' b"the batter won't get back in the box." b'' b'' b'a "reasonable" umpire would have recognized that ron gant was' b'disturbed with the call. a "reasonable" umpire would have realized that' b'there was a 1-run game in progress, with two outs in the ninth. what' b'ron gant did was try to regain his composure. what a "normal" baseball' b'player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument' b"with the umpire, and since you can't argue balls and strikes, he would" b'have been ejected from the game. ron gant, by trying to avoid such a' b'conflict, was penalized for showing some restraint.' b'' b'incidentally, a "reasonable" home plate umpire would not have been' b'so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire, as gant' b'requested. if the home plate umpire had appealed to first, the first base' b'umpire could have wrung up the strike, and gant would not have been so' b'upset. if the call had been a ball, and the catcher had requested the' b'appeal, it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help.' b'' b'finally, the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so-called' b'efforts to "speed up the game." the game was played very quickly, it was' b'just at hours when the stuff happened in the ninth, and the only delays' b'in the entire game had been *the result* of actions by the umpires (other than' b'deion having to clean garbage off the field).' b'' b'--' b's to my correspondents: my email has been changed. e'
