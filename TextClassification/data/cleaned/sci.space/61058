b'' b'' b'' b'' b'i heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in' b'that essentially says "if you never hear from earth again,' b'here\'s what to do." this was a back up in the event a receiver' b'burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but' b'still some data).' b'' b'' b'voyager has the unusual luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the' b"solar system. all it's doing is collecting fields data, and routinely" b'squirting it down. one of the mariners is also in stable' b'solar orbit, and still providing similiar solar data.' b'' b'something in a planetary orbit, is subject to much more complex forces.' b'' b'comsats, in "stable geosynch orbits, require almost daily' b'stationkeeping operations.' b'' b'for the occasional deep space bird, like pff after pluto, sure' b'it could be left on "auto-pilot". but things like galileo or' b"magellan, i'd suspect they need enough housekeeping that" b"even untended they'd end up unusable after a while." b'' b'the better question should be.' b'' b'why not transfer o&m of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding' b'to support these kind of ongoing science missions.' b'' b'pat' b'' b'when ongoing ops are mentioned, it seems to always quote operations' b'and data analysis. how much would it cost to collect the data' b'and let it be analyzed whenever. kinda like all that landsat data' b'that sat around for years before someone analyzed it for the ozone hole.' b'' b'even if you let teh bird drift, it may get hosed by some' b'cosmic phenomena.' b'' b'since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for' b'startup, if some type of cosmic bem took out the probe, it might' b"not be such a big loss. obviously you can't plan for" b'everything, but the most obvious things can be considered.' b'' b'' b'| "i know you believe you understand what it is that you b'| think i said. but i am not sure that you realize that b'| what i said is not what i meant." b'' b''
