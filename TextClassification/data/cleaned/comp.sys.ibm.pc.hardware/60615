b'' b'' b' [stuff about the connection between ide and ida deleated]' b' 8mhz clock, bit width, 5mb/sec.' b' if ide speed come from ida where does the 8.3mb/s sighted for ide' b' come from?' b'' b'well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3mhz bus, bits' b'wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3m' b'bytes/sec. someone said that it really takes clock cycles to' b'perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5mb/s,' b'which is the commonly-used figure for isa bus speed. however, i' b'believe a two-clock transfer is possible wait states).' b'--' b'os/2 will do for me until amigados for the comes along...'
