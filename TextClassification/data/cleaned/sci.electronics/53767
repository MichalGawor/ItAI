b'' b'' b'just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles' b'on your electronic odometer with an oscillator....' b'' b"i wouldn't expect to be able to do this. not because the engineers at bmw are" b'putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile' b'environment for electronics, and i would expect the software to be conservative.' b'' b'if i were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,' b'it would have the following features just off the top of my head b'' b'* debouncing/deglitching is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? b'* smoothing: the rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:' b'this is a car, not an electron.' b'* top speed limit: anything above 200mph is ridiculous: must be' b'electrical noise or contact bounce' b'' b'as for getting in and presetting the pins: if this is the circuit board out of' b'a bmw dashboard, i seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the' b'middle of the card. good luck getting at the counter b'' b"i wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter: remember, it's" b"probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected. after all," b'a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics; there used to be an' b'app note in the national semiconductor linear databook that went into this' b'in good detail.' b'' b'' b'' b'- jerry kaidor'
