b'' b' not that the question is anything important, but i am still curious:' b' why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green? i have seen' b' a few blue ones, but no red, yellow, company logo etc. is there a' b' technical reason or could it be that the marketing "geniuses" have' b' not tought about it (yet)?' b' b' juha' b'the color of the board shows the composition of it, hence the use of it.' b'' b'original and older boards were bakelite composition, and were brown.' b'phenolic (spelling) was a tan' b'most "non filled" fiberglass boards used in computers are green.' b'filled fiberglass is blue.' b'teflon is white.' b'' b'as boards evolved more and more demands were made of them. first boards were' b"used mainly in audio circuitry. couldn't be used in high voltage or rf because" b'it would arc and burn. most boards today are fiberglass, the type being chosen' b'by its use and cost.' b'' b'boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon (and ceramic) as the' b'fiberglass, and other boards are conductive (they actually work more as a' b'capacitive dialectric, but the word conductive simplifies explaination) at the' b'high frequencies.' b'' b'another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections' b'is a thin flexible (mostly mylar) material and is used to connect the front of' b'the vehicle (etc) to the back instead of wiring harnesses. camcorders use this' b'to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance.' b'' b'am working on a generator made by hewlet packard right now and the entire board' b'is gold plated, boy it looks expensive!!!' b'' b'hope i got most of my facts right as i am working from memory of material read.' b'' b'my education was pre-transister!' b'--' b'73, tom' b'================================================================================' b'tom wagner, audio visual technician. malaspina college nanaimo british columbia' b'(604)753-3245, loc fax:755-8742 callsign:ve7gda weapon:.45 kentucky rifle' b'snail mail to: site q4, c2. rr#4, nanaimo, british columbia, canada, v9r 5x9' b'' b'i do not recyle..... i keep everything!
