b'' b'i need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to' b'deliver joules at volts. this implies a 200uf cap. i have built' b'a very satisfactorily operating version from a max641, but do not like' b'the idea of using a single source part. it seems that the ubiquitous' b'camera flash circuit is what i want, but i cant get mine apart without' b'breaking it. i would appreciate receiving the circuit description or' b'a source of one. i have already looked in several electronics circuits' b'handbooks to no avail. thanx' b'--' b'______________________________________________' b'| "mind your business", on first us coin b'|____________________________________________|'
