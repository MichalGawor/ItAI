b'' b'hi all,' b'' b'in short: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing' b'on svga graphics.' b'' b'complete:' b'i am thinking of a simple but fast molecular' b'graphics program to write on pc or clones. (ball-and-stick type)' b'' b"reasons: programs that i've seen are far too slow for this purpose." b'' b'platform: class machine.' b'800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 vga graphics' b'(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering' b'purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for' b'speed reason.)' b'(hope the code would be generic enough for different svga' b'cards. my own card is based on trident 8900c, not vesa?)' b'' b"what i'm looking for?" b'1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes' b'on above-mentioned svga resolutions.' b'presumably in assembly languagine.' b'yes, very fast please.' b'2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.' b'drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of' b'text, else later.' b'(you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule)' b'2) and any other codes (preferentially in c) that can help the' b'project.' b'' b'final remarks;-' b'non-profit. expected to become share-, free-ware.' b'' b'any help is appreciated.' b'thanks' b'' b'-frankie' b'' b'ps pls also email, i may miss reply-post.'
