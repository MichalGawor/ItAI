b'' b"here's one i hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or" b'contribution to:' b'' b'in the state of virginia radar detectors are illegal, period. if' b'you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will' b'not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.' b'the fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle' b'(even if it is not on) is sorry, tourist, ignorance of' b'the law is no excuse they will get you too!' b'' b'it used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for' b'an officer to actually see the radar detector. not any more! many' b'law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.' b'right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up rf' b'from the radar detector itself. my first reaction was "no way!"' b'but, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police' b'are writing citations right and left for people using radar' b'detectors. one news story quoted an officer as saying that he had' b'found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,' b'and he could never figure out where it was but he knew it was' b'there. this tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.' b'' b'now, before i get flamed, please understand that i do drive at or' b'near the speed limit. i do not need a radar detector to keep me' b'from getting a speeding ticket. but, i do like to know when my' b'speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning. my radar' b'detector now stays locked in my trunk when i am in virginia (which' b'is what they want and yes, what the law says, and i intend to' b'obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.' b'' b'for my fellow hams, i am not a microwave person my mind only' b'works in the hf spectrum between and meters. microwave' b'enlightment may be necessary.' b'' b'so, the questions are b'what do the radar detector detectors actually detect?' b'would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray rf generated by' b'a radar detector, or is the rf actually being emitted by the detector' b'antenna?' b'are any brands "quieter" than others?' b'' b'==============================================================================' b'randy t. agee ars wb4bzx at some point, you probably pondered the' b'p.o. box 20th floor meaning of life, and you came up with a' b'virginia department of education satisfactory answer, which has or has not' b'richmond, va stood the test of time, or you shrugged' b'phone mightily, muttered "beats the heck out of' b'=============================================================================' b''
