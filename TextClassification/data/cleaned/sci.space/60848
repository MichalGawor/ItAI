b'' b'' b'the difficulties of a high isp otv include:' b'long transfer times (radiation damage from vanallen belts for both' b'the spacecraft and otv' b'arcjets or xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have' b'to have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of' b'radiation damage) or big solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy)' b'that make attitude control and docking a big pain.' b'' b'if you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with' b'current technology. nuclear power sources are strongly restricted' b'by international treaty.' b'' b'refueling (even for very high isp like xenon) is still required and]' b'turn out to be a pain.' b'' b'you either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation' b'to do docking or and refueling) b'' b"you still can't do much plane change because the deltav required is so high!" b'' b'the air force continues to look at doing things this way though. i suppose' b'they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and' b'the problems get solved. not impossible in principle, but hard to' b'do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today.' b'' b"just a few random thoughts on high isp otv's. i designed one once..." b'' b'steve collins'
