b'' b'' b'hi all,' b" this is the first time i've posted to the net, so i hope this is" b'going to the right people.' b" i'm looking for software packages that run on an ibm pc clone that" b'allows me to display openlook and motif windows on the pc.' b' the idea is to use the pc as a cheap x windows terminal for use by' b'process engineers at work.' b'' b'if you already own all the "clone" equipment then there are lots of such' b'programs (see a current copy of unix world magazine).' b'' b'*but* your performance will suck lemons running an xserver on a clone.' b'(from experience). you would be much better off with an xterminal if this' b'is a new install. the performance will be at least four times better.' b'in addition it would be much easier to install and use. on top of that' b'they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4mb ram, ethernet card,' b'very high performance graphics card, good monitor, server software, tcp/ip' b'for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole' b'lot of b'' b'i can get tektronix xp11 terminals for under and the performance' b'is over xstones.....' b'--' b'/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\' b'| mark a. davis lake taylor hospital norfolk, va (804)-461-5001x431 b'\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/'
