b'' b'| question is "on what authority do we proclaim that the requirements of the' b'| b'| fourth commandment are no longer relevant to modern christians?" please' b'| b"i don't believe most christians believe they are *above* the law. however," b'we are not saved by adherence to the law. the law exists to tell us what' b'is sinful. we all sin.' b'' b'hence we are "all" above the law where "all" in this case refers to' b'christians.' b'' b'jews believe that their sins are atoned for with' b'blood sacrifice of animals as described in the old testament.' b'' b'when was the last time you heard about a jewish animal sacrifice?' b'' b'christians' b'believe that their sins are atoned for by the blood sacrifice of jesus.' b'' b'the blood sacrifice of an innocent man?' b'' b"this does not make the law 'irrelevant'." b'' b"then why don't christians follow it, why don't they even follow their" b'own ten commandments?' b'' b'breaking the law *is* sinful,' b'and we are to avoid sinful ways, but sinning, by itself, does not jeopardize' b'salvation.' b'' b'so, in short; hitler is in heaven and gandhi is in hell?' b'' b"note that i'm not a theologian. but this is the gist of several" b"sermons i've heard lately and some bible studies i've been through." b'' b'did you ever wonder if someone, perhaps a great deceiver, was pulling' b'your leg?'
