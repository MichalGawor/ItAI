b'' b'just to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not' b'the only important thing. he is imo the best fielder of bad throws from' b'the other infielders. i have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch' b'balls off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad' b'infinitum. *and* he gets the out, much of the time. some of the things' b'he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing. you have to give' b'mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot' b'near the bag (yes, i am sure he gets a few calls because he is mattingly b'' b'--' b"keith keller\t\t\t\tlet's go rangers!!!!!" b"in this corner\t\t\t\tlet's go quakers!!!!!" b'weighing in at almost every weight imaginable b'life, and all that surrounds it.\t\t blues traveler,
