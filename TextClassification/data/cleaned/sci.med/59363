b'' b'' b' msg is common in many food we eat, including chinese (though some oriental' b" restaurants might put a tad too much in them). i've noticed that when i" b' go out and eat in most of the chinese food restaurants, i will usually get' b' a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards. this happens to many' b' of my friends and relatives too. and, heh, we eat chinese food all the' b" time at home (but we don't use msg when we're cooking for ourselves)" b'' b'heck, i seem to feel like that *every* time i eat out. including' b'in the cafeteria at work. about half the time, the headache intensifies' b'until nothing will make it go away except throwing up. ick.' b'' b"as you might imagine, i don't eat out a lot. i guess my tolerance" b'for food additives has plummeted since i switched to eating mostly' b"steamed veggies. they're easy to fix, that's all." b'' b"i won't even mention what happened the last time i ate corned" b'beef.
