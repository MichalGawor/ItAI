you see, it was an arbitrary act of "retaliation".' b'' b'' b'| if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel, is it not working? why' b'| is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages?

while i also hope for this to happen, it will' b'| only occur when arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the' b'| responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their' b'| soil. they have to prove it (or provide some "guaratees"), there is no way' b'| israel is going to accept their "word"- not with their past attitude of' b'| tolerance towards "anti-israel guerillas in-residence".' b'| b'| if israel is not willing to accept the "word" of others then, imho, it has' b"| no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks." b'|' b'| this is just another "selectively applied" statement.' b'|' b'| the reason for this drawn-out impasse between ababs/palestinians and israelis' b'| is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other. by your' b'| criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.' b'|' b'| that is precisely why the palestinians (in their recent pisga proposal for' b'| the "interim" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are' b'| demanding conditions that essentially define "autonomy" already. they do' b'| not trust that israel will "follow through" the entire process and allow' b'| palestinians to reach full autonomy.' b'|' b'| do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians?' b"| if you do, then why should israel's view of arabs/palestinians" b"| be any different? why should they trust the arab/palestinians' words?" b'| since they don\'t, they are very reluctant to give up "tangible assets' b'| (land, control of areas) in exchange for "words". for this reason,' b'| they are also concerned about the sorts of "guarantees" they will have' b'| that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached.' b'' b'first, i believe that my statement applies to both sides.' b'' b'having said that, i think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately' b'negotiable and what is not. for example, no country has the right to abuse' b"one's human rights. deciding whether there will be one or two states in" b'palestine is a legitimate question. while de facto one state exists, israel' b'must treat all within its domain equitably.' b'' b'| tim, you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been' b'| disarmed. hezbollah remains the only independent militia. hezbollah does' b'| not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up' b'| sheikh mosavi, his wife, and young son.' b'|' b'| while the "major armaments" (those allowing people to wage "civil wars")' b'| have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still' b'| remain to some extent. rocket attacks still continue, and "commando"' b'| raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard' b'| for human life (yours of that of others). such attacks also continue.' b'' b'yes, i am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify' b"occupying your neighbor's land. israel must resolve its disputes with the" b'native palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks.' b'' b'| of course, if israel would withdraw from lebanon' b"| and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't" b'| make the lebanese so mad as to do that.' b'|' b'| bat guano. the situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks' b'| were commonplace.' b'' b'not true. lebanese were not attacking israel in the 1970s. with a strong' b'lebanese government (free from syrian and israeli interference) i believe' b'that the border could be adequately patrolled. the palestinian heavy' b'weapons have been siezed in past years and i do not see as significant a' b'threat as once existed.' b'' b"please, tim, don't fall into the trap of treating lebanese and palestinians" b'as all part of the same group. there are too many who think all arabs or all' b'muslims are the same. too many times i have seen people support the bombing' b'of palestinian camps in "retaliation" for an idf death at the hands of the' b'lebanese resistance or the shelling of lebanese villages in "retaliation" for' b'a palestinian attack.' b'| tim'
