b'' b'' b'a great many computer programmers read "dr. dobb\'s journal". in a recent' b'issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read. it' b'said:' b'' b'"there\'s nothing wrong if microsoft setting the standards for the computer' b'industry. the industry needs an ibm for the 90\'s."' b'' b'where has the hacker ethic gone? not the "cracker" ethic, which is something' b'entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the' b'free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative? why is' b'it that people and corporations like bill gates, ibm, and intel are able to' b'have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry? why is it that, if a person' b'like myself posts messages to usenet on how to get into the little nooks,' b'crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any' b'useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely' b'ignored) why is it that people like steve jobs have to abandon their efforts to' b'make truly innovative products? i ask those of you who call yourselves' b'hackers, why is this? and further, how can you let it go on? it is a fact' b'that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so' b'for a long time to come. it has allowed the propagation of information in a' b'volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller' b'than it was before. i shudder to think what that world will be like if the' b'corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the' b'286, windows, and the ibm product line on the computer-using public.' b'' b'that is not to say i am against business per se; people who profit off of' b'innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me. in fact, i applaud' b'it; that is the american way. but those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative' b'systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the' b'problem. and, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for' b'blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.' b'' b'i put it to you thus: where has the hacker ethic gone? if it still exists,' b'where? and, if it does exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers"' b'allowing this to perpetuate itself? why are they not creating new, innovative,' b'interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the' b'computer industry?' b'' b'i await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.' b'' b'+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+' b'| "szechuan death" khan singh b'| "star trek ii: the wrath of khan"|' b'+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+'
