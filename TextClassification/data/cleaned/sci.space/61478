b'' b'' b'being wierd again, so be warned:' b'' b'is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to' b'keep watch? i help it better to ask questions before i spout an opinion.' b'' b'how about a mission (unmanned) to pluto to stay in orbit and record things' b'around and near and on pluto.. i know it is a strange idea, but why not??' b'it could do some scanning of not only pluto, but also of the solar system,' b'objects near and aaroundpluto, as well as seti and looking at the galaxy' b'without having much of the solar system to worry about..' b'' b'doing this in anything like reasonable time would require more' b'propulsion capability than we can manage. you would have to boost to' b'pluto and then slow back down. you could do something like a hohman' b'orbit, but i think that would take ridiculous amounts of time (my' b'rubber bible is at home).' b'' b'--' b'"insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live' b'in the real world." mary shafer, nasa ames dryden' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
