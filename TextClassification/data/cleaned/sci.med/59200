b'' b'i am looking for a rat cell line of adrenal gland cortical cell -type. i' b'have been looking at atcc without success and would very much appreciate any' b'help.' b'' b"i shot off a response to this last night that i've tried to cancel. it was" b'only a few minutes later while driving home that i remembered that your' b'message does specifically say cortical. my first reaction had been to suggest' b'the pc12 pheochromocytoma line. that may still be a good compromise, depending' b"on what you're doing. have you concidered using a mouse cell line from one" b'of the sv40 t antigen transgenic lines? another alternative might be primary' b'cells from bovine adrenal cortex.' b'' b'mike'
