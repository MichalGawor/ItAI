b'' b'' b"i've noticed an interesting phenomenon on my centris if i unplug the" b'keyboard and mouse and plug them in again without turning the power off,' b'the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed. i check' b'the "mouse" control panel, and there\'s no change in its setting there--it\'s' b'still on full speed, the way i like it. restarting the machine restores the' b'normal mouse speed.' b'' b'by the way, it happens with both the newer-style mouse that came with the' b"centris, and the older-style mouse from my iifx at work. thus i don't think" b"it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouse--it's" b'definitely a quirk of the adb interface (either hardware or software) in the' b'centris itself.' b'' b'i have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my lciii. perhaps it is' b'a quirk of the new machines?' b'' b'--dan'
