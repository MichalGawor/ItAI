b'' b'' b'' b'for a project of my own, i would like to build a infra-red remote control' b'receiver (for regular vcrs and tvs remotes). does anybody have any info' b'or tips on how to build such receiver b'in particular,' b'a) which photo detector should i use (which wavelength do remotes use) b'b) which ics or circuit should i use b'c) any suggestions for circuit layout' b'' b' \tanother suggestion find a brand of tv that uses an ir remote,' b' and go look at the sams photofact for it. you can often find some very' b' detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the' b' transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding' b' specs. if the system uses that.' b'' b"probably won't help. i'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer" b'used those little self-contained modules. i think sharp made them.' b'radio shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.)' b'' b'the module had leads: power, ground and demodulated output. it' b'contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator' b'all in a tiny metal can.' b'' b'if you want to buy one, try radio shack, or else a tv repair shop can' b'probably order one. btw the carrier frequency is khz, and each' b'different tv/vcr/cable box/stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse' b'scheme to perform each different function on their equipment.' b'' b'' b'jim ritterbusch' b'there is an art, the guide says, or rather a knack to flying. the' b'knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.' b''
