b'' b' i am trying to design a small 90mw 472mhz fm transmitter for remote alarm' b' use.' b'' b'' b'pretty high frequency for one chip...' b'' b' is there an fm transmitter ic available that can be used for this purpose?' b'' b' any help, circuits, info etc will be greatfully accepted.' b'' b'' b'' b'yes and no. i would use the fm transmitter chip from motorola (linear and' b'interface databook), a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer (e.g. sbl-1 from' b'mini circuits lab). everything is done in the fm chip and then mixed up with' b'the oscillator frequency. just have a look at the arrl handbook. there are lots' b"of ideas in there about oscillators and mixing. i don't think, there are single" b'chip designs for such high frequencies yet.' b'' b' thanks in advance.' b'' b' graham castledine.' b'' b'cheers robert hb9nby' b'--' b'robert ganter\t\t\t/------------\\' b'universitaet basel\t\t| i am a fan b'institut fuer informatik\t| of my plan b'basel/switzerland\t\t\\------------/'
