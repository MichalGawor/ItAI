b'' b'' b'are you for real? how many gold gloves does ozzie smith have? if a' b"guy hung around and hit homers a year for years, wouldn't he" b'be a given for the hall? is defense not just as important?' b'' b'frankly, no. offense and defense are equally important. but the' b'pitcher is of the defense. the primary role of every other player' b'is on offense. even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive' b'game than of the defensive game. (they might not do much with their' b"part of the offense, but that's another issue.)" b'' b'that being said, i think both smith and yount deserve the hof. they' b'hit pretty well in addition to their defense.' b'' b'cheers,' b'-valentine'
