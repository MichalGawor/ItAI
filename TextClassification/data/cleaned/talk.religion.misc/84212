b'' b' my hope is that brian will look and will see the ramifications of the' b' truck coming towards him. my hope is that brian will want to step out' b' of the way. my fear, though, is that brian will instead choose to glue himself' b' to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over. but if' b' he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing i can do beyond that' b' to change his mind. for it is his choice. but at this very moment,' b" brian hasn't gotten even that far. he is still at the point where he" b' does not want to look. sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his' b' head will not turn around to see the entire picture. so far he is' b' satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance.' b'' b'' b'the problem is that you imagine him inside this huge wall, unable' b'to see reality. while he imagines the same about you. clearly we' b'have a case where relativity plays a big role concerning looking' b'at opposite frames of reality.' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
