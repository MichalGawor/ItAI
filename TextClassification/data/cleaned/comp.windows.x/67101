b'' b'some one asked me recently why they when they used xquerybestcursor to see' b'if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the' b'server did not create cursors of that size. investigation showed that some x' b'servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while' b'others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. the interesting thing' b'to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware b'a sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are ok, while a' b"sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. so far i've also seen this behavior on" b'ncd and phase-x x terminals and have been told it also occurs on hps.' b'actually, the ncd is even more liberal sizes much larger then the root' b'winodw are gladly returned as ok. is xquerybestcursor semi-broken or is this' b"behavior correct? i'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor!" b'' b'--' b'national center for atmospheric research lokkar borni under sole-vegg' b"box boulder, co 80307-3000\t gjo'i med sitt shinn" b'303-497-2057 jagar borni inn.'
