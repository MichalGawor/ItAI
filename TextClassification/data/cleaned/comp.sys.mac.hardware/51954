b'' b'' b'' b"i'm currently trying to select which magneto-optical drive to purchase. i'm" b'primarily looking at 128mb drives, although i might consider 256mb ones.' b'' b'when looking through macworld and macuser ads, the prices for the 128mb drives' b'seem to range from just under (for the dgr 128rem portable, magic 128mb' b'portable fujitsu, or nudesign 128mb from macdirect) to about (for the' b'fwb hammerdisk and mass microsystems datapak mo/128). different drives' b'use different mechanisms most, fujitsu, sony, epson, probably some others.' b'' b'my problem is that after reading the nov macworld and apr macuser' b"reviews of these drives, i'm still not sure what to get. so, i'm asking" b'if anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128mb m-o drive or can shed' b'some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me' b'much?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or' b'anything else i should probably know.' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'john sasinowski' b''
