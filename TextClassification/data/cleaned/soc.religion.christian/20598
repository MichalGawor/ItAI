b'' b'i would like to see christians devote a bit less effort to _bashing_' b'paganism and more to figuring out how to present the gospel to pagans.' b'' b'christ is the answer; the pagans have a lot of the right questions.' b'unlike materialists, who deny the need for any spirituality.' b'' b'' b'' b'one of the things i find intersting about pagan beliefs is' b'their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. being' b'brought up in a christian household, i often wondered if there was god' b'the father, where was the mother? everyone i know who has a father' b'usually as a mother. it just seemed rather unbalanced to me.' b'fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not' b'fall into line with a lot others, recognized god as a being both' b'without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both' b'a masculine and feminine force. it provides a sense of balance i find' b'sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which i think is responsible' b'for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat' b'each other.' b'--' b'******************************************************************' b'your comfort is my silence!!!!! act-up! fight back! talk back!' b'******************************************************************'
