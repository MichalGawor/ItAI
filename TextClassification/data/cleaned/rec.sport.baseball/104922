b'' b'' b"i'd have to say the most impressive hrs i've ever see came from dave kingman" b'and his infamous moon-raker drives...' b'' b'i remember one he hit circa at wrigley field that went across' b'the street (in dead center field) and hit a house on the roof. he' b'whiffed a lot, but when he *did* connect, watch out!' b'' b'my favorite was the barry foote homer that bounced on waveland and through' b'a second floor window across the street. second though, would be the kong' b'drive that was last seen bouncing down the street that dead ends to the' b'park at waveland.' b'' b'mike timlin'
