b'' b'' b'i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues,' b'however, a couple of them seem as though they do not require "incredibly' b'perverse interpretations" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.' b'...' b'would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say' b'fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god? how does this apply' b'to homosexuals? i understand "fornication" to be sex outside of' b'marriage. is this an accurate definition? is there any such thing as' b'same-sex marriage in the bible? my understanding has always been that' b'the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband' b'and his wife. i am, however, willing to listen to scriptural evidence' b'to the contrary.' b'' b'if we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from' b'speaking in church. paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could' b'err. i find it interesting that christ never discussed the issue of' b'homosexuality, certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious' b'transgression christ would have condemned it.' b'i find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying' b"to stamp out something that christ didn't consider worth a single word" b'of condemnation. christ repeatedly warns us against judgement.' b'don\'t we risk "judgement in equal measure" when we condemn people who' b'god himself did not judge when he walked on the earth?' b'' b'--' b'| the love of christ is contagious!' b'--+--' b'|' b'' b'[i should not that many of our readers do in fact advocate forbiding' b'women from speaking in church. this is an issue we have discussed' b"in the past, and i'm not interested in redoing. --clh]"
