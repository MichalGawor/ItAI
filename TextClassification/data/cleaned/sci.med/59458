b'' b"recently i've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon" b'cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.' b'' b"no doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers. i'm" b'rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature' b'in the accepted academic/scientific journals. so, the righteous among' b'them will no doubt jump on that.' b'' b"also, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption" b"that it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the" b'gi tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for' b'maybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too.' b'' b"then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even" b'though he, like linus pauling, is lucid and robust well into his' b"nineties--but nevermind about that. he shouldn't charge for his" b"equipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the" b'fda. of course, with fda approval an md or pharmaceutical company can' b'charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as' b'thalidomide. but nevermind about that either.' b'' b'unfortunately, you dared to step into the sacred turf of net.medical.' b'discussion without a credential and without understanding that the' b'righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced' b'before dismissing you as a fool.' b'' b'but maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will' b'send you some reasonable responses by e-mail.' b'' b'1/2 b'' b'1/2 b'' b'oh yes, i did have a point. a few years ago an md with a thriving' b'practice in a very wealthy part of silicon valley once recommended that' b'i take such treatments to clear up a skin condition. (not through his' b"office, i might add.) although i'm sure that's not conclusive, it was" b'sure an unusual prescription!' b'' b'-r'
