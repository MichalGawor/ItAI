b'' b'' b'+---------------' b' back in the days of x11.1 i did analyse the xterm code. the cursor' b" was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character. i doesn't" b" seem to be changed 'til now." b' but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via' b' xtappaddtimeout or similar b'' b'the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous, though (see also desqview/x,' b'which does this in its dos windows). do you really want xterm to wake up every' b'half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt?' b'' b"so what? i'm running emu on a mhz box. i cannot make out any" b'difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or' b'not (if you think about it a bit, a cycle of ms is a hell a lot of' b'time for even the slowest pc). since you would of course only enable' b'the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this' b'application is active anyway. to repeat it, a blinking text cursor' b'costs almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when' b'designing the xterm software.' b'' b'michael' b'--' b'intelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer doofe mia' b'fermentation fault (coors dumped)'
