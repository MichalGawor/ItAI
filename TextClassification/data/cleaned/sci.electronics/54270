b'' b'' b" i'm wondering if i can tote my american touch tone phone around with me" b" to sweden and germany. it's dc powered, and i can buy a special adapter" b' for that in europe. the question is if the general electronics work' b" the same. i can buy a different wall plug and refit it (i'm sure i'd" b' have to), but would that do the trick?' b'' b'two things to watch for:' b'in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some' b'of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the' b'phone can be set to pulse dialing.' b"in sweden, the is the first digit and all other digits" b'are pushed "down" by one position; this makes dialing (and' b'in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.' b'otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign' b'phone to either the german or swedish phone system.' b'otoh neither you nor i would ever try that, as it is of course' b'illegal.' b'--' b'' b'i am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular american phone' b'on your home system. i vaguely remember a few years ago, when "deutsche' b'bundespost" split into postdienst, postbank, and telekom there was some' b'discussion about a new regulation. i know that cordless or cellular phones' b'still have to be approved by the telekom, but does that hold true for regular' b'phones? in my areacode in germany frechen, near koeln) you can use' b'touch-tone dialing. i assume, however, that most areas are still exclusively' b"set to pulse dialing. last time i checked (jan the cologne areacode b'was still solely pulse dialing.' b'' b'btw, touch tone does become more common in germany, bringin with it the' b"flourishing of services (in germany i just hope we'll all have" b'isdn some time at an affordable price idle wishes...' b'' b'markus iturriaga' b'"things go smoother with lard!"' b'' b'millard fillmore lives!' b'' b"===============we've=got=what=it=takes=to=take=what=you've=got.================="
