b'' b'here is someones "biblical" claim for the characteristics of satan:' b'' b'this is probably the portion of scripture that you were talking about, isaiah b'this does speak of the "morning star" which, according to you is the' b'babylonian prince. ok, so i turn your attention to daniel this passage' b'concerns a revelation of prophecy to daniel by the messenger from god. within' b'this passage, the messenger from god speaks of how he fought for weeks' b'against the prince of the persian kingdom. obviously, this prince was not an earthly' b'prince. this prince of the persian kingdom is probably one of the demons' b"in satan's hierarchy. as such, the morning star can be the prince of babylon w" b"ho can also be satan. another passage concerning satan's fall from heaven is" b'ezekiel b'' b'and separately:' b'' b'devil chose to try to become greater than god.' b"he wanted to sit on god's throne." b'when the devil was created, he was one of the most beautiful angels in heaven.' b'' b"we have here three distinct claims concerning the results of the devil's" b'decision making, a specific desire, and a physical description. now, in' b'support (aside from the minor detail that an author seldom writes an unbiased' b'account of the opposition) we see:' b'' b'isaiah b'' b'isa how art thou fallen from heaven, o lucifer, son of the' b'morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken' b'the nations!' b'' b'isa for thou hast said in thine heart, i will ascend into' b'--------------------' b'heaven, i will exalt my throne above the stars of god: i will sit' b'-----------------------------------------------------' b'also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:' b'' b'isa i will ascend above the heights of the clouds; i will' b'be like the most high.' b'' b'isa yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides' b'of the pit.' b'' b'' b"doesn't say sits on god's throne. says will exhault throne above the stars." b'' b'daniel b'' b'dan then said he unto me, fear not, daniel: for from the' b'first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to' b'chasten thyself before thy god, thy words were heard, and i am' b'come for thy words.' b'' b'dan but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me' b'------------------------------' b'one and twenty days: but, lo, michael, one of the chief princes,' b'------------------------' b'came to help me; and i remained there with the kings of persia.' b'' b'dan now i am come to make thee understand what shall be-' b'fall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for' b'many days.' b'' b'' b'see who is being discussed?' b'' b'' b'ezekiel b'' b'eze son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of' b'-----------' b'tyrus, and say unto him, thus saith the lord god; thou sealest up' b'-----' b'the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.' b'' b'eze thou hast been in eden the garden of god; every pre-' b'cious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the dia-' b'mond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the em-' b'erald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy ta-' b'brets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou' b'wast created.' b'' b'eze thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and i have' b'set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of god; thou hast' b'walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.' b'' b'eze thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou' b'wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.' b'' b'eze by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled' b'the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore' b'i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god: and i' b'will destroy thee, o covering cherub, from the midst of the' b'stones of fire.' b'' b'eze thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou' b'hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: i will' b'cast thee to the ground, i will lay thee before kings, that they' b'may behold thee.' b'' b'eze thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of' b'thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will' b'i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour' b'thee, and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight' b'of all them that behold thee.' b'' b'eze all they that know thee among the people shall be as-' b'tonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be' b'any more.' b'' b'' b'' b'anyone else to make a claim about the characteristics of the devil?' b''
