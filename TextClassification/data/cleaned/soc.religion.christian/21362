b'' b"who's law is it that a wedding has to happen in a church? the only reqirement" b'is that you and the bride agreee to marry each other. how also can you say b'"christian wedding" when the proces of marriage is nt really discussed in the' b'bible. why mus t a person get a civil marriage also? the only standards i' b'look to are those imposed upon me by god... not of society.' b'' b'if you want to live with someone, you can.' b"if you don't want to have a civil marriage, don't." b"if you don't want to have a wedding in a church, don't." b'if you want to call that a marriage, go right ahead.' b'' b"i hope that the young people that are around you, don't follow your example." b'' b'' b'|-------------------|' b'| gary chin b'| staff engineer b'| sun microsystems b'| mt. view, ca b'|-------------------|' b'' b'[if the original message claims that marriage is not discussed in the' b'bible, i have to disagree. various aspects of marriage are discussed' b"in some of paul's letters, ephesians sees marriage as a symbol of" b"god's relationship with the church. if it means specifically that the" b"marriage ceremony isn't described, then that seems to be true. but i" b'think what most people mean by christian marriage is not so much that' b'it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various' b'commitments to each other that are associated with marriage in the' b'bible. --clh]'
