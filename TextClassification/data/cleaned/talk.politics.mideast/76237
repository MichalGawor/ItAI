b'' b'\ti have just started reading the articles in this news' b'group. there seems to be an attempt by some members to quiet' b'other members with scare tactics. i believe one posting said' b'that all postings by one person are being forwarded to his' b'server who keeps a file on him in hope that "appropriate action' b'might be taken".' b"\ti don't know where you guys are from but in america" b'such attempts to curtail someones first amendment rights are' b'not appreciated. here, we let everyone speak their mind' b'regardless of how we feel about it. take your fascistic' b'repressive ideals back to where you came from.' b'' b'it would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of' b'freedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to-' b'frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do' b'occur. there are situations where a few extremely vocal, and' b'usually radical, people **do** drive people away, effectively stifle' b'all other ("opposing") views and generally "take over". *clearly*,' b'the purpose behind such actions is *to deprive* others of *their*' b'freedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of' b'the "media form" in question. while "freedom" of speech is to be valued,' b'this is not. how would you suggest that this sort of reoccuring problem be' b'alleviated? more particularly, how can this be controlled within the' b'structure of these newsgroups?' b'--' b'tim clock ph.d./graduate student' b'uci tel#: department of politics and society' b'fax#: university of california irvine' b'home tel#: irvine, ca
