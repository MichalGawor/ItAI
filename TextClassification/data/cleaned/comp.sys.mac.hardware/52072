b'' b'' b' yes, i know computers and harddisk drives should be always on. but what about' b" monitors? they generate a lots of heat. should i or shouldn't i keep them on" b' hours a day? any advice? thanks. take care...paul' b'' b'there has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement. true,' b'there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but' b"the internal power supply is well-protected. (i've turned my mac on and off" b'six or seven times a day for three years without problem). the monitor is' b'the same. to leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity twice as much' b'as a television, possibly more.' b'' b"turn it off when you're not using it. it'll save you money and the world" b'a few more resources.' b'' b'-kelley-' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------' b'i buy and pay for my own opinions'
