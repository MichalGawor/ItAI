b'' b'this is a rfd on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a' b'sharing on the "johannine hours" as proposed each month by the monks of' b'the ecumenical community of taize (pronounced te-zay) in france.' b'' b'name of proposed newsgroup:' b'==========================' b'' b'soc.religion.taize (unmoderated)' b'' b'' b'purpose of the group:' b'====================' b'' b'the taize community is an international ecumenical community of monks' b'based in france. many young adults come there to search for meaning in' b'their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a' b'sharing with others. this newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a' b'monthly "johannine hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each' b'month. a "johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given bible' b'passage, followed by some questions for reflection. any thoughts that' b'may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be' b'posted here. we are not interested in theological debate, and even less' b'in polemics. no expertise is required! the idea is to help one another' b'to deepen our understanding of scripture as it is related to our own' b'life-journey.' b'' b'the idea of "johannine hours" was born in taize as a simple response' b"to all those who were trying to assimilate the bible's message in the" b'midst of their daily life. because of work or studies, it is often' b'impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but' b'everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit' b'quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. there, in silence,' b'we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of' b'christ.' b'' b'during the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we' b'understand and not waste time worrying if, in some biblical expressions,' b'we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ. the idea is to' b'communicate to others what we have understood of christ, not burdening' b'them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought' b'us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.' b'' b'perhaps those who read and think about the "johannine hours" in this' b'newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.' b'' b'the important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the' b'personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect' b'of sharing, which through usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.' b'' b'background of the taize community:' b'=================================' b'' b'the following provides some background information on the life and' b'vocation of the taize (pronounced te-zay) community.' b'' b'"a parable of communion": august with europe in the grip of' b'world war ii, brother roger, aged set up home in the almost' b'abandoned village of taize, in eastern france. his dream: to bring' b'together a monastic community which would live out "a parable of' b'community", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of' b'the time. centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal' b'refugees, especially jews fleeing from the nazi occupation.' b'' b"an international and ecumenical community: taize's founder spent the" b'first two years alone. others joined him later and at easter b'seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and' b'celibacy. year by year, still others have entered the community, each' b'one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.' b'today, there are brothers, catholics and from various protestant' b'backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. some of them are' b'living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in asia, africa, north' b'and south america. the brothers accept no donations or gifts for' b'themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no' b'capital. the brothers earn their living and share with others' b'entirely through their own work. in sisters of saint andrew, an' b'international catholic community founded years ago, came to live' b'in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming' b'people in taize.' b'' b'taize and the young; the intercontinental meetings: young adults, and' b'less young, have been coming to taize in ever greater numbers since' b'1957. hundreds of thousands of people from europe and far beyond have' b'thus been brought together in a common search. intercontinental' b'meetings take place each week, sunday to sunday, throughout the year' b'and they include youth from between and countries during any' b'one week. the meetings give each person the opportunity to explore' b'the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner' b'life and human solidarity. the meetings in summer can have up to' b'6,000 participants a week. three times every day, the brothers and' b'everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the church' b'of reconciliation, built in when the village church became too' b'small.' b'' b'"a pilgrimage of trust on earth" the community has never wanted to' b'create a "movement" around itself. instead, people are called to' b'commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,' b'their city or village. to support them in this, taize has created' b'what it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". at the end of each' b'year, the pilgrimage has a "european meeting" which brings together' b'tens of thousands of young adults from every part of europe for' b'several days in a major city. there have also been meetings in asia' b'and in the united states. every year, brother roger writes an open' b'letter to the young. usually completed during a stay in one of the' b'poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages' b'and provide themes for reflexion for the following year.' b'' b'note: discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in' b'news.groups.' b'' b'' b'--' b'. 1st 1.10b taize-community, taize, france'
