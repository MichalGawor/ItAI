b'' b'' b'rule 7.09(k) states: "it is interference by a batter or runner when b'in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base' b'... he runs outside the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of)' b"the foul line and, in the umpire's judgment, interferes with the field-" b'er taking the throw at first base..."' b'' b'the key word in the rule is "and." a runner isn\'t out just for running' b"out of the baseline. he's out for interfering with the fielding of the" b'ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first. because the catcher' b"opted to throw the ball over the batter-runner's head, there's no inter-" b'ference.' b'' b"sorry, i still don't buy it. you're certainly right that the runner is" b'not out merely for running out of the baseline: he must interfere with' b'the play. but the argument here is over what constitutes interference.' b"you certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batter-runner" b"must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference: you haven't posted" b'a definition of interference at all.' b'' b'imo this calls for one of the "approved ruling[s]" that go in small print' b'in the rulebook. something like:' b'' b'approved ruling:' b'if in the judgement of the umpire the runner, by running to the left' b'of the allowed path, caused the fielder to make a bad throw, blocks the' b'vision of the fielder receiving the throw, or otherwise impedes the' b"defensive team's making a play on him, the batter-runner shall be" b'judeged guilty of interference.' b'' b'or' b'' b'approved ruling:' b'the runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes' b'contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball.' b'' b'--' b'in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor' b'rules trivia question--since it cannot be authoritatively answered.' b'--' b'len reed' b'holos software, inc.' b'voice: ext.
