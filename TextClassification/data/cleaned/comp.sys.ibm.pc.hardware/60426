b'' b'' b' can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why, if i get os/2, i might' b' need an scsi controler rather than an ide. will performance suffer that' b" much? for a 200mb or so drive? if i don't have a tape drive or cd-rom?" b' any help would be appreciated.' b'' b'' b'there is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you' b'more cpu power then you had before, and that is with i/o overlap.' b'with i/o overlap, your cpu can continue to "think" while disk' b'operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your cpu sits idly' b'waiting for each disk operation to finish and disk operations take' b'an *eternity*, compared to a fast cpu.' b'' b"so, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by" b'increasing the amount of overlapping you do.' b'' b'one way is with dma or bus mastering. either of these make it' b'possible for i/o devices to move their data into and out of memory' b'without interrupting the cpu. the alternative is for the cpu to move' b'the data. there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and' b'bus mastering. ide, however, is defined by the standard at interface' b'created for the ibm pc at, which requires the cpu to move all the data' b'bytes, with no dma.' b'--' b'os/2 will do for me until amigados for the comes along...'
