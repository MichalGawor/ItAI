b'' b'' b"last week's macweek article by ric ford indicated that david ramsey's" b'mac iix has been running nicely with a mac iici rom in it, offering' b'clean 32-bit rom code (liberating his iix from the virtual memory' b"nightmare caused by apple's 32-bit system enabler)." b'' b'does anyone know of a source for these roms? is it okay for a' b'remanufacturer to resell only rom chips from used machines? i know that' b'copies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to' b'resell the original used rom. (after all, reselling a used computer' b"involves the sale of the rom anyway, so what's the difference?)." b'' b"needless to say, i'm interested in purchasing such a rom. what would" b'be a reasonably price to offer?' b'' b'/\\/\\ morgan davis group
