(i know that this' b'would never happen, but it seems a lot more palettable than' b'a vat).' b'' b"canada's gst is collected as a sales tax and is considered a vat." b'funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was' b'never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it,' b'thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the gst b'one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).' b'' b'the stated intent of the tories was to use the gst to write down' b"our deficit. unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any" b'mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and' b"the money is now sitting in escrow. i don't know what is involved" b'in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the tories are not' b'fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending,' b"they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by" b'the end of this time the end of their second term years).' b'while they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up' b'in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business' b"rivals, the liberals (as in euro/uk), the tories' heir-apparent" b"for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of hillary" b'clinton b'' b'gld' b'--' b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ je me souviens b'gary l. dare'
