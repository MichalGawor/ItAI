b'' b'wrote:' b' i think this proves by point. the caps game goes into overtime but' b' "due to contractual obligations" they have to switch to the fucking baseball.' b' (sorry for my language but im pissed!) what the hell were they going to do' b' if their scheduled game went into overtime? espn get your head out of your' b' ass.' b'' b' now i know there are a lot' b'' b'hey american hockey fans,' b'' b'as a hockey fan i can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel. the' b"problem is that other americans don't give a shit about hockey. they view" b'it as a bunch of canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the' b'shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in' b'two-thirds of the us to see the stuff naturally. on the other hand' b'baseball is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* "national pasttime". baseball is so' b'romanticized in the us that you are supposed to forget that other sport' b'exist after april and before november i feel that since espn shows b'baseball games a week they should be able to show an ot hockey game instead' b'of the opening innings of a baseball game. hell, the game is going to last' b'2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first hrs? and i am an indians' b"fan! show the end of what you started, then switch! but then, i'm a" b'hockey fan, what do i know? baseball is the all mighty sport.' b'' b'jason' b'go whalers! pick well!'
