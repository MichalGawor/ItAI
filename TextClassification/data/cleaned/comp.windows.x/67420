b'' b"i am in the process of modifying an x application that uses xlib. i'd" b'like to include a timer-driven facility (for network polling)' b'' b'you have to do the same sorts of things that xt does with its main loop.' b'that is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a' b'select(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop. you can obtain the' b'file descriptor of the x display connection using' b'fd connectionnumber (display);' b'' b'the functionality of the main loop dispatcher in xt is quite useful.' b'the good news is, you can get the source and plagiarize!'
