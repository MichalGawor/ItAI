b'' b'' b'' b'has anyone had problems with ami pro after running pctools (v7.1)' b'compress? i have not corrupted data due to having caches other than' b'pc-cache running, so that is not it. the first time i try to run ami' b'pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (i think it was a)' b'segmentation fault in amipro.exe right before it finishes, with all times' b'after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when' b'it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module' b'amiproui.dll at i have not been able to fix this problem except' b'by reinstalling ami pro. this has happened twice, with both times being' b'after having ran compress on my hard drive. btw, i am not running stacker' b"or any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know," b"pctools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name. my system is" b'a 386-40mhz, with 16mb of ram and a nec (oem) hard drive, etc, but that' b"shouldn't make a difference." b'' b"please email me as i can't keep up with the newsgroup, and it will cut down" b'on net traffic anyways. thanks.' b'' b'-derek' b'' b''
