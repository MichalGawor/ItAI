b'' b'could someone please do one of the following:' b'1. point to an init that allows me to turn off power management on my' b'duo b'1. write an init that would allow me to turn off all power management on' b'duo b'2. point me to documentation on power management so that i can write such' b'an init.' b'3. explain to me why such an init is totally or partially impossible.' b'' b'ideally, of course, i would like to be able to turn in on and off on the' b'fly.' b'' b'surely such an init would be very helpful to powerbook owners who want to' b'do midi... i cannot imagine why it is not possible to do, unless it requires' b'apple to divluge some secret. and if that is the case, the surely apple' b'could write the init. (unless apple brings out new models so fast these' b"days that even they don't know how they work)." b'' b'scott petrack' b''
