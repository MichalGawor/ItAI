b'' b'' b': here is a press release from the california department of insurance.' b':' b': california insurance commissioner endorses federal legislation to' b': protect consumers from scam insurance companies' b'----------------' b'i may be a little dense but i would have thought that protecting consumers' b'from scam insurance companies would be the prime objective of something' b"called the cal insurance commission. if they aren't accomplishing that now" b'then why do we need them?' b'' b"very simple. an 'insurance commissioner' is a bureaucrat a regulator." b'it is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws. he/she cannot' b'make laws. if there is no law that covers a specific subject, say' b'scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one. so they have' b'to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted. for' b'the california insurance commissioner, there are two possible legislative' b'bodies: the california state legislature and the u.s. congress. we all' b'know how little the california state legislature accomplishes, esp.' b'along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement). so' b'garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance' b'of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam' b'companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to' b'have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.' b'' b'john eaton' b'!hp-vcd!johne'
