b'' b'in regards to fractal commpression, i have seen fractal compressed "movies".' b'they were both fairly impressive. the first one was a gray scale "movie" of' b'casablanca, it was 1.3mb and had minutes of fps video. it was a little' b'grainy but not bad at all. the second one i saw was only minutes but it' b'had bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2mb.' b'' b'i consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore. but unlike many' b"other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution. i don't know what" b'kind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" i saw but the guy' b'that showed them to me said it took minutes per frame to generate. but as' b'i said above playback was or more frames per second. and how else could you' b'put minutes on one floppy disk?' b'' b'my opinions are my own except where they are shared by others in which case i' b'will probably change my mind.'
