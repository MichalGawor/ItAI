b'' b'i built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch' b"audio. i got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing switched. i was doing" b'most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and' b'nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.' b'' b'' b'my question is:' b'' b'\tis there a good relay/relay circuit that i can use for switching' b'audio, so that there will be *no* noise of any kind on the audio lines.' b'' b'' b'i will appreciate any advice or references to advice. also, exact part' b'numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!' b'' b' are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp' b' out level signals? also, are the clicks you mentioning the big' b' clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact' b' bounce? how are you driving the relays? ttl gate output? switching' b' transistor? how are the relays connected to what you are driving?' b'' b' need more specifics to answer your question!! b'' b'as a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer' b'the circuit with the contacts. the noise you hear is due to the momentary' b'opening and closing of the path.' b'' b'the noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit. in high' b'impedance audio circuits a resistive "t" is constructed close to characteristic' b'impedance of the circuit. grounding the imputs (connected to the t) transfers' b'the audio.' b'' b'in low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are' b'shorted out or grounded. secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic' b'impedance.' b'' b'sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used' b'to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.' b'' b'telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "make before' b'break and vica versa" but i haven\'t seen any of these for years.' b'' b'nowadys switching is done electronically with op amps, etc.' b'' b'a novel circuit i used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. it consists' b'of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube. when the lamp is' b'off the cell is high resistance. turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers' b'passing the audio. once again this device in a "t" switches the audio. varying' b'the lamp resistance give a remote volume control. use variable resisters and' b'you have a mixer!' b'' b'lots of luck!' b'--' b'73, tom' b'================================================================================' b'tom wagner, audio visual technician. malaspina college nanaimo british columbia' b'(604)753-3245, loc fax:755-8742 callsign:ve7gda weapon:.45 kentucky rifle' b'snail mail to: site q4, c2. rr#4, nanaimo, british columbia, canada, v9r 5x9' b'' b'i do not recyle..... i keep everything!
