b'' b'' b'' b' after seeing hrivnak and tabarraci play, who' b' would you prefer to have? and how about' b' tyler larter? what ever happened to him??' b'' b' \tyou know what my answer will be: hrivnak! the choice is obvious.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'ok, but have you seen tabaracci play yet? in his two starts and' b"his relief effort for beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp don't" b"forget the shutout. i think he's let in just four goals over eight" b'periods of play. i like hrivnak, but we might actually have to give' b'some credit to david poile for a change after this trade.' b'' b"hopefully if tabaracci starts against the isles tonight, i haven't" b'jinxed him.' b'' b'frank salvatore'
