b'' b'' b' not honoring our wives can cause our prayers to be hindered:' b'' b' you husbands likewise, live with your wives in' b' an understanding way, as with a weaker vessel,' b' since she is a woman; and grant her honor as' b' a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your' b' prayers may not be hindered. i peter b'' b"one interpretation i've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin" b"of physically abusing one's wife. the husband is usually physically" b'stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.' b'he must honor her as his sister in christ. this would therefore be an' b'example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.' b'' b'this verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what' b"is god's will for his family without consulting his wife. god reveals" b'his will to both the husband and the wife. there needs to be some' b'degree of mutuality in decision making. even those whose understanding' b'of the bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the' b'husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.' b'one way to look at it is that god speaks to the wife through the husband' b'and to the husband through the wife.' b'' b''
