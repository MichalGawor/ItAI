b'' b'' b'anas omran has claimed that, "the israelis used to arrest, and' b'sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters." the assertion' b'by anas omran is, of course, a total fabrication. if there is an' b"once of truth iin it, i'm sure anas omran can document such a sad" b'and despicable event. otherwise we may assume that it is another' b'piece of anti-israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does' b'not know how to teach their children to tell the truth. if omran' b"would care to retract this 'error' i would be glad to retract the" b'accusation that he is a liar. if he can document such a claim, i' b'would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar. failing' b'to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.'
