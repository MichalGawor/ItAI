b'' b'after hearing endless debate (read: name-calling) over which os is better, dos' b'and windows or os/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple' b'of different operating systems, i have decided to put the two products to a' b'head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested. i have,' b'however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont really' b'do what it says (i.e. run windows apps) os/2 will not run windows' b'apps in enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but' b'os/2 which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to. i have heard' b'that os/2 beta is available via ftp, and i was wondering if anyone knew' b'where to obtain a copy. i would appreciate any information, as i would like,' b'once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.' b'' b"i don't think the question is:" b'"will os/2 x.x run windows y.y apps now?"' b'' b'a more important question is:' b'"will subsequent os/2 versions continue to run apps' b'from subsequent windows versions in the future?"' b'' b'can it keep up? will a future os/2 run windows apps?' b'ole2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come.' b'after this fall, i believe ibm no longer has any rights to' b'view microsoft code. after that, the only way to maintain' b'some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer. would' b'you want to reverse-engineer an ole2 application?' b'' b'' b'--' b'airborne geophysics' b'geological survey of canada, ottawa'
