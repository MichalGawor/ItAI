b'' b'in history seems to imply some pretty serious sin. the one of the' b'pastors in the church i attend, christchurch city elim, considers' b'that a prophesy of a natural disaster as a "judgement from the lord"' b'is a clear sign that the "prophesy" is not from the lord.' b'' b'i would like to see his reasoning behind this. you may have gotten' b'"burned" by natural disaster prophecies down there, but that' b'does not mean that every natural disaster/judgement prophecy is' b'false. take a quick look at the book of jeremiah and it is obvious' b'that judgement prophecies can be valid. here in the us, it seems like' b'we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies, though i' b'am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement.' b'' b'sometimes god does give words that are difficult to swallow. the' b'relative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to' b'dismiss it. much of the ot is not happy stuff.' b'' b'link hudson.'
