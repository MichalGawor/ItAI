b'' b' in answer' b'to a question from hawking, chahine described a proposed' b'drag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it\'s only' b'a concept."' b'' b"so what's a drag free satellite? coated with wd-40?" b'' b'i am puzzled by the term "concept." drag free may already have' b'been flown. it was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would' b"more accurately respond to motions from the earth's gravity field and" b'ignore drag. it was proposed many years ago and involved a ball' b'floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little' b'adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. the ball itself would' b'then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity' b'anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously' b'adjusting its position to compensate for drag.' b'' b'' b'(904) 644-4014\t\tfax or
