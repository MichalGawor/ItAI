b'' b'i am a bit nervous about posting this beacause it is begining to' b"stray fron the topic of space but then again that doesn't seem to" b'stop alot of other people. b'' b'with all of this talk about breathing at high pressures, i began' b'to think about the movie abyss. if you remember, in that movie one' b'of the characters dove to great depths by wearing a suit that used' b'a fluid that carries oxegen as opposed to some sort of gas. now i' b'have heard that mice can breath this fluid but for some reason, humans' b'are unable to. does anyone know more details about this?' b'' b'gregson vaux' b'' b'' b'i believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump' b'the liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after minutes.' b'so if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on' b"hold, or else!! that's about it. remember a liquid is several more times" b'as dense as a gas by its very nature. i think, depending on the gas' b'and liquid comparision of course!' b'' b'acurist' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
