b'' b'' b'sigha.' b'' b'1) trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my cb360t... are' b'there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a "slip-in" bulb replacement)?' b'' b'2) was told by a guy at the bike shop that my "not damn near bright enough"' b'incandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. so i went and' b'picked up this cheapo "motorcycle battery and charging system tester"...' b'hook it up to the battery, it\'s got lights on "very good charge"... start' b"the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even register. it's" b'supposed to light or lights if everything is ok, but it stays down at' b'the same point as just the battery.' b'' b'my question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up,' b"how the heck is the battery staying fully charged? i'd think it would be" b'darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...' b'' b"do the cb360t's have a problem with their charging system? are they" b'just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?' b'' b'is there an easy fix for this?' b'' b'3) happy noise: put miles on my bike this weekend, finally got myass an' b'endorsement.... which is really good, because my cage just quit running' b"worth a damn and i won't have money to repair it until the first... and" b'the weatherman says "bright and sunny all week, chance of rain on' b'friday"...' b'' b'<big grin, bugs in teeth'
