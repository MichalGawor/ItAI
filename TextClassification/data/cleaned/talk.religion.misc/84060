b'' b'jim and andy both have it incorrect i believe:' b'' b'the *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the' b'present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured' b'in the past. these *facts* exist with or without a theory.' b'' b'the *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate' b'to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both' b'coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions.' b'' b'the *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation,' b'relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they' b'behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain' b'how they interact... or even why.' b'' b'a theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict' b'the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this' b'fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported*' b'by the *facts*. a theory is a mental construct, a speculation,' b'a model. if it is a good model, it may be useful.' b'' b'in science a theory is something that is supported by the' b'evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence.' b'a *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not' b'yet enough evidence to support it. when a new hypothesis' b'is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain' b'*all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least' b'some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or' b'predict new facts.' b'' b"it is so simple.... i'm surprised that this subject gets" b'beat to death about once a month. a quick glance in a dictionary' b'would clear up of the confusion and bandwidth in this' b'newsgroup. then we could talk about really important things' b'like, why do men have nipples?' b'' b'-david utidjian-' b'' b'' b'' b'-'
