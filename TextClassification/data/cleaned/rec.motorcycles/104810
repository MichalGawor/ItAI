b'' b'a few random thoughts on riding with a passenger:' b'' b"there's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken" b'passengers very occasionally on the small etc) bikes i used to' b"ride in the uk it was hard i'm now riding a gs1100 and that's great," b'even moving from my freinds gsx600 i was riding recently. this may be due' b'in part to the fact that neither i, nor my regular passengers, are' b'particularly slimline b'' b'i always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes' b'their movements predictable.' b'' b'my regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,' b"i don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods." b"again that may be biased by the fact that i've had a couple of new passengers" b'(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,' b'making any kind of maneuvering difficult.' b'' b"i've also discovered that on longer trips i prefer a passenger who moves and" b'shifts their weight a bit. i recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about' b'a hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also' b'sitting very still and getting a sore back.' b'' b"we have a code system for turns, stop and for 'i need to shift position'." b'--' b'chris seabrook, fujitsu open systems solutions inc phone: +1-510-652-6200x118' b'6121 hollis street, emeryville, ca usa fax: b'| dod: b'per saltire gules and or, a sun counterchanged.'
