but i labored even more than all of them, yet not i,' b'but the grace of god with me.' b'' b'11 whether then it was i or they, so we preach and so you believed.' b'' b'12 now if christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead,' b'how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?' b'' b'13 but if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even christ has' b'been raised;' b'' b'14 and if christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your' b'faith also is vain.' b'' b'15 moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of god, because we' b'witnessed against god that he raised christ, whom he did not raise,' b'if in fact the dead are not raised.' b'' b'16 for if the dead are not raised, not even christ has been raised;' b'' b'17 and if christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are' b'still in your sins.' b'' b'18 then those also who have fallen asleep in christ have perished.' b'' b'19 if we have hoped in christ in this life only, we are of all men most' b'to be pitied.' b'' b'20 but now christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of' b'those who are asleep.' b'' b'21 for since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection' b'of the dead.' b'' b'22 for as in adam all die, so also in christ all shall be made alive.' b'' b'23 but each in his own order: christ the first fruits, after that those' b"who are christ's at his coming," b'' b'24 then comes the end, when he delivers up the kingdom to the god and' b'father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.' b'' b'25 for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.' b'' b'26 the last enemy that will be abolished is death.' b'' b'' b"logical proofs of jesus christ's resurrection" b'' b"1. jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen his" b'body because that would have perpetrated the' b'resurrection--the very opposite of what they' b'desired.' b'' b"2. jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen his" b'body because pontius pilate established guards' b'to stand watch over the tomb lest his body be' b'stolen.' b'' b"3. sadly (and ironically), many of jesus' disciples" b'did not believe in the resurrection until jesus' b'had risen from the dead.' b'' b'4. in nearly centuries, no body has ever been' b"produced to refute jesus' assertion that he" b'*would indeed* rise from the dead.' b'' b'5. the probability of being able to perpetrate such' b'a hoax successfully upon the entire world for' b'nearly centuries is astronomically negative!' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^'
