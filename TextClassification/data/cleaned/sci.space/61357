"common law"' b"rights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on a" b'bill of rights in the constitution, spelling out exactly what they' b'demanded from the government. legitimate or illegitimate, power is' b"power. that's why the federal government can force states to grant" b"their citizens rights they don't wish to: in a slugging match, the feds" b'win. period.' b'' b"and you're right, this doesn't belong in sci.space. i've said my" b'peace. no more frome me on rights (at least not here).' b'' b'most gracious regards,' b'whh' b'' b'doug loss'
