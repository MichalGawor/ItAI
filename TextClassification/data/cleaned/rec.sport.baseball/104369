b'' b'' b'after reading my local paper today, i found out that the phillies' b"started the season at i am not as old as but i've" b'heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that' b'season. they were ahead of the cardinals by games that season in' b'mid-august. they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the' b'cardinals took the division. games ahead and lost it.... i' b'hope this season is much different.' b'' b'' b'strictly from memory, i think the phillies were something like' b'ten games up with to go, lost in a row, and of last b'to lose to the cardinals. seems impossible, but thats how i' b'remember it. i also felt at the time that johnny callison of' b'the phillies lost the mvp as a by-product of their swoon.' b'' b'' b'jerry' b'' b'p.s. in a single team out of won the pennant; no divisions.'
