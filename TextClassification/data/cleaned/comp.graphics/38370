b'' b'\twe need a good concave -convex polygon conversion routine.' b"i've tried a couple without much luck. please e-mail responses and i" b'will post a summary of any replies. thank you.' b'' b'richard stoakley' b'' b'the problem is not precisely defined above, but if you need to find' b'the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon, then' b'you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon. there' b'are two ways to do this: use a somewhat tricky but by-now well' b'examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary,' b'or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull' b'routine and accept o(n log n). both methods are discussed in' b'preparata and shamos, for example.'
