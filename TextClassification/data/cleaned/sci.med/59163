b'' b'wrote:' b'' b'' b" a friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of crohn's" b' disease.' b'' b" but she can't seem to eat certain foods, such as fresh vegetables," b' without discomfort, and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence.' b'' b' her question is: are there any nutritionists who specialize in the' b" problems of people with crohn's disease b'' b' (i saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric).' b'' b' thanks in advance,' b' john eyles' b'' b'if she is having problems with fresh vegetables, the guess is that there' b'is some obstruction of the intestine. without knowing more it is not' b'possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,' b'or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine. in general, there are' b"no dietary limitations in patients with crohn's except as they relate" b'to obstruction. there is no evidence that any foods will bring on' b"recurrence of crohn's. it is important to distinguish recurrence from" b'recurrent symptoms. a physician would think of new inflammation as' b'recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the' b'intestine.' b'' b"your friend should look into membership in the crohn's and colitis" b'foundation of america. b'' b'good luck to your friend.' b'' b'steve holland'
