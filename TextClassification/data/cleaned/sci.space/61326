b'' b'thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my' b'question about which countries engage in space surveillance.' b"unfortunately, i apparently didn't make the meaning of the message" b'clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance,' b'rather than space surveillance' b'' b'what i meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at' b'the earth (satellite reconnaissance) but _was_ which countries have' b'programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of)' b'satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance).' b'' b'the us uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating' b'quasi-radar operated by the navy, to do this for satellites in leo, and' b'electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above km or so.' b'the fee, i understand, does much the same thing.' b'' b'amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches' b'and pcs for objects out to around km, enabling them to keep track' b"of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available." b'see the fascinating books by desmond king-hele for details, as well as' b'the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov. the' b'material posted in my previous message suggests that japan engages in' b'optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be' b'that other countries do also.' b'' b'which was the question i meant to ask: who are they, how do they do' b'it, and why do they do it?' b'' b'' b'allen thomson saic mclean, va' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b"oh, yes: i don't speak for saic." b''
