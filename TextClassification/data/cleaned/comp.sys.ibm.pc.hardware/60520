b'' b'i am unable to get my gateway 486dx2/66 to run windows' b"in 1280x1024. i ordered a 2m ati ultra pro, and i'm pretty" b'sure the 2m is really there because i *can* select' b'1024x768x65536. but no matter what i do with the flex program' b"in the ati's program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out." b'i have windows build of the drivers, dos the' b"drivers were installed by gateway, not by me, so perhaps there's" b'a file missing from the hard drive. it runs 1024x768 just fine.' b'i did go into the desktop window and select 1280x1024. sometimes' b'it refuses (ghosted out), other time it accepts it, but when i hit' b"ok and re-enter desktop, it's back to 1024x768. at no time does" b'it unghost 1280x1024 in the main flex window. help!' b'' b'--' b'| "black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall, b'| when your back\'s against the wall...." -leslie fish
