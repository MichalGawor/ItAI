b'' b" okay dod'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya b'' b'' b" the stud on the side of the bike that clunked when i turned was absent. i'm" b' fairly sure it was there before the event. in fact, the thread in' b' the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something' b' having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.' b'' b' okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this how can you' b' rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without' b' damaging the thread in the hole b'' b"you can't knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying" b'the threads. also part of the stud would still be in the hole.' b'therefore the stud was *not* in the hole before you touched something' b'down on that side of the bike.' b'....dr. doom'
