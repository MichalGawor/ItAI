b'' b'i have a simple test. i take several people who can speak' b'only one language (e.g. chinese, russian, german, english).' b'then i let the "gifted one" start "speaking in toungues".' b'the audience should understand the "gifted one" clearly' b'in their native language. however, the "gifted one" can' b'only hear himself speaking in his own language.' b'' b'that would be neat, but nowhere in the bible does it say' b'that one who has the gift of tounges can do this. if the gift' b'of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone,' b'no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the' b'gift of interpretation, and i corinthians would not have had to' b'have been written.' b'' b'' b'perhaps i would believe the "gifted ones" more if they were' b"glorifying god rather than themselves. then perhaps we'd" b'witness a real miracle.' b'' b"that's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million" b'christians world wide. sure, there are some who want glory' b'for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those' b'who do not have this gift. there were people like this in the corinthian' b'church also. that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all' b'who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.' b'i would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges' b'do so more often in private prayer than in public.' b'' b'link hudson' b'' b'[there were apparently those in the early church who claimed that' b'at pentecost the miracle was that the crowd were all given the' b'ability to understand the apostles speaking in greek. --clh]'
