b'' b'' b' we *do* need an alternative to nsa-bugged telephones, but' b" we're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized" b' cellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.' b'' b'so start a company and build them. this is still mostly a capitalist' b'economy...' b'' b'qualcomm had spare cycles in the dsps for their new cdma digital' b'cellular phones. they wanted to put strong crypto into them since they' b'had the capacity. the government decided to "discourage" them.' b'' b'really, none of this stuff is especially hard. all you need for a true' b'private phone is an isdn codec, a vocoder (either a chip or' b'software), an encryptor (a chip is fine, but software is more than' b'fast enough), a v.32 or v.32bis modem module, and maybe a' b'microcontroller to run the whole thing. its easy to do, its cheap. and' b'any "normal" company trying to put one out will likely get a visit' b'from the boys in the dark suits from washington, just like qualcomm' b'did. i suspect that companies like cylink are tolerated because their' b'products are too expensive.' b'' b'however, no law yet stops one from building really private phones, in' b'spite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new' b'"crime bill" and in connection with the clipper/skipjack big brother' b'chip. someone out there will build a unit to do all this. better yet,' b'prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any box with a' b'sound card into a secure phone.' b'' b'--' b'--' b'laissez faire, laissez passer. le monde va de lui meme.'
