b'' b'' b'[part of posting removed]' b'' b'* the sony cpd-1304 has better video circuitry than either of the' b'other two monitors. it can display apple 640x480, vga 640x480, vga' b'800x600 (though this has hz flicker), and apple 832x624 hz' b"refresh: no flicker at all). it might be able to display apple's" b"1024x768, but i'm not sure about this, and the pixels would be real" b'small anyway so it might not be that useful.' b'' b'note that with either sony monitor, you will need the proper adapter,' b'which both connects the video signals properly, but also informs the' b'macintosh video hardware of which display mode to use.' b'' b'[part of posting removed]' b'' b'--' b'epistemology and learning group, mit media lab cambridge, ma usa' b'' b"i'm assuming that the cabling tells the mac, at startup, what kind of" b"monitor is connected. now i think i've seen ads in popular mac" b"magazines for products (i'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a" b'video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions' b'on the fly (w/o restarting the mac).' b'' b'if you were to buy a would it be possible to switch back and' b'forth between apple 640x480 and apple 832x624 without restarting the' b'mac? is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software' b'intervene, or does the mac hardware occasionally probe the cable' b'setting and switch automatically?' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'eric'
