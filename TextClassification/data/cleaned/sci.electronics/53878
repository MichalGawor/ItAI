b'' b'' b'i have written a program and i want to market it. i would like certain degree' b'of protection, since my main custmers are individuals and not the' b'cooperations. i know laser hole burning method, and hardware key method,' b'however, my software is going to cost only so i can not afford that.' b'also, at this low price i can not afford people make too many copy of my' b'software. well, i guess say upto illigal copying is ok by me.' b'' b'however, i do not want someone to get a copy of pctools and copy my software.' b'off course, i never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying, since they' b'can develope a better program anyway.' b'' b"i wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if i were you. if you program" b'is any good, the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be' b'distributing the stripped version is well under a week.' b'' b'hardware methods prevent j. random loser from using his copy ii pc to pirate' b"your software, but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough" b'connections to "real" pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your "check for the' b'hole" code.' b'' b'you may want to price your software (depending on what it is) a tad' b'higher... a price change from to probably would turn off very few' b'potentials buyers, and that way you could tolerate more pirates (whose' b"numbers don't change with the price)." b'' b'as for the pirating figure... ha, ha. of course, a lot of pirates just' b'have this "thing" about having pirated software, even if they never use it,' b"so perhaps that really wouldn't count towards even so, is awfully" b'low.' b'' b'' b'---joel kolstad' b'' b"p.s. i assume you're talking pc software. if you're talking unix," b'hp-48, or something else somewhat obscure, copy protection might be a' b'slightly more viable alternative.'
