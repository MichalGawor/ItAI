b'' b'will clark' b'matt williams' b'robbie thompson' b'rod beck........all came up through the giants system.' b'' b'geez. everyone comes up with clark, williams, thompson. these guys' b"were all up in that's ancient history. so in the last years," b"noone, right? beck doesn't count. i said solid years." b'' b'btw, manwaring lead the ml last season in throwing out baserunners. he is' b'an excellent defensive catcher. i agree that his offensive skills are' b'limited but he does seem to be improving on them.' b'' b"let's see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch." b'as i remember, even bob brenly had a good throwout percentage under' b'roger craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown' b'out. of course, he suffered from ball strike homers a lot too.' b'i am not a big fan of manwaring.' b'' b'' b'--dave'
