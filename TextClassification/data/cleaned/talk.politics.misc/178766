b'' b'' b'' b'' b'|any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare' b'|a private state has drifted into anarchy. there are laws to control' b'|the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that' b'|they were being violated. they set out to obtain a legal warrant and' b'|attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang' b'|the doorbell.' b'|' b"| the batf, in a letter they've been sending out to people," b'|says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of' b'|surprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it' b'|slammed in their faces.' b'|' b'| it strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to' b'|serve a warrant by knocking on the door.' b'' b'presumably the b-d did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen' b'ready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the doorbell.' b'' b'once inside the building the batf would have been in control. trained' b'police officers are a match to any bunch of bozos playing at soldiers.' b'' b'' b'|had they' b'|expected the b-d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who' b'|would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up' b'|in a tank and broken the door down on day one.' b'|' b'| phill, the batf were in a firefight with the bd for *forty-five*' b'|minutes. i find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful' b"|citizens they *wouldn't* have shown up in live-stock trailers and would" b'|have retreated immediately.' b'' b'not a smart move. unless meant to be part of the surprize cover. even so' b'the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea. a side opening' b'truck would have been much better, more like a covered waggon.' b'' b'' b'| if they *were* expecting peacful citizens, why show up with over' b'|a hundred officers, some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying' b'|sub-machineguns, and national guard helicopters?' b'' b'sounds just about right to me. its the minimum amount of force that i' b'would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talk.politics.guns' b'annual dinner.' b'' b'michael hesseltine ordered the use of over crack troops including' b'members of the parachute regiment to remove approx hippy peace' b'protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles. he' b'even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings. just about the' b'most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener. that single' b'action probably cost him the position as prime minister. one of the elders' b'of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of toryism.' b'hesseltine ever after was something of a national joke.' b'' b'' b'phill hallam-baker'
