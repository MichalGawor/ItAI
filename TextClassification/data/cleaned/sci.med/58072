b'' b'' b'a friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically' b'every few months for the last years. an episode begins with extreme' b'tiredness followed by:' b'' b'1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,' b'knees, and hips.' b'2. generalized muscle pains' b'3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears' b'4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day' b'5. hemorrhaging in both eyes. her opthamologist calls it peripheral' b'retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy. (she' b"isn't diabetic--they checked." b'6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone' b'poles do not appear to be straight)' b'7. loss of peripheral vision.' b'' b'many tests have been run and all are normal except for something' b'called unidentified bright objects found on a mri of her brain. the only' b'thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone. at' b'times she had been on mg per day. whenever she gets down to mg' b'the symptoms become acute again.' b'' b'she is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming' b'worse with each episode and her vision is suffering. none of the docs she' b'has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop' b'it. any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks in' b'advance. kathy turner' b''
