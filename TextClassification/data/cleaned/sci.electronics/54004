b'' b'i would like to hook up some cameras that were recently donated to our' b'local community cable tv station which have sync inputs in the form' b'of horizontal and vertical drive. our station sync is a black burst' b'which works fine with other boxes with "genlock" style inputs. can' b'anyone point me at a design, article, or whatever showing how to produce' b'the horizontal vertical drive signals? thanks in advance.' b'jack powers' b''
