b'' b'' b" all in all, i'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the" b' moon for a year is wise and/or useful. how about: a prize for the' b' first' b' non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a' b' manned' b' moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from' b' lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.' b' find' b' some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure... having a single' b' goal' b' might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person' b' appeared' b" to win. and for those that didn't give up, i find something a little" b' scary' b" about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters. i'd" b' like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.' b'' b' lastly, about ten or fifteen years back i seem to recall that there was' b' an' b' english space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases' b' on' b' the cheap. i recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human' b" body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from" b' solar' b" flares, etc. unfortunately i don't remember the name of this magazine." b' does this ring a bell to anyone?' b'' b' craig keithley |"i don\'t remember, i don\'t recall,' b' apple computer, inc. |i got no memory of anything at all"' b'' b'' b'i love the idea of progressive developmental prizes, but the assumption' b'has' b'been all along that only the u.s. gummint could fund the prizes. it' b"wouldn't and couldn't do such a thing but b'' b'an eccentric billionaire could offer such a prize or series of prizes.' b'' b'anyone know h. ross perot or bill gates personally?' b'' b'john g.'
