b'' b'' b' i told some friends of mine two weeks ago that koresh was dead.' b' the fbi and the batf could not let a man like that live. he was' b' a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.' b' b' \t[...deleted...]' b' b" unfortunately, i think you've got it figured pretty well. i also ask" b' myself the question "why did they plan for so many months. why was' b' this so important to them? what was the government really up to?' b' why did they seal the warrant? were they after koresh or were they' b' after the first and second amendments, among others?' b'' b' allow me to play devils advocate a moment jg:' b'' b' \to what was called many months of *planning* was probably' b' \t the intelligence collecting: paperwork and interviews.' b'' b" \to it's important to them because it justifies budgets." b'' b' \to the warrant was sealed to keep from jeopardizing the' b" \t the government's case." b'' b' \to there was probably no one actually exercising oversite.' b' \t instead, a system of bureaucratic rules has been set' b' \t up for such incidents. like computer programs these' b' \t have to be debugged periodically. especially when used' b' \t in fringe areas. (cf. the "hostage rescue" program).' b' \t therefore no one was in charge. and no one can' b' \t reasonably be held responsible.' b'' b'baloney. either the programmer or the people who decided to let their' b'actions be governed by the program are clearly at fault. if you neglect' b'to do maintenance on your car, and the steering goes out, you _are_' b'responsible for the death of all those kids on the sidewalk your car' b'subsequently drives over "on its own".' b'' b'gene battin' b'no .sig yet'
