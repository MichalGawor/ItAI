b'' b'' b'| b'| this is not a fresh case of' b'| ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga' b'| of intense mutual hatred, destruction,...' b'| b'| every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and' b'| destruction. the holocaust was not a "fresh case." it was another' b"| chapter in a year history of attacks on jews in europe. that didn't" b'| make it acceptable. and balkan history does not make the genocide against' b'| bosnian muslims acceptable.' b'|' b'| i guess that it was not acceptable because germany *also* chose' b'| a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of' b'| other countries in peril. i wonder whether us or other countries' b'| would have risked themselves if only jews were persecuted and' b'| hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (i am no student of history' b'| and i am just asking questions.)' b'' b'actually, the record of the allies activities, in the face of' b'incontrovertible evidence as to what the nazis (may they rot in hell)' b'were doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done' b'nothing. the railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease' b'of doing so. the us, the "place of refuge" allowed in a bare pittance' b'of jews from europe, primarily for public relations, so that the' b'government could say it was "doing something". many ships with' b'refugees were turned away from us shores; some found refuge in cuba or' b'south america, many others sunk or had to return to europe (with' b'predictable consequences). the hope today is that we have' b'collectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other' b'countries\' "internal affairs". the sad reality is that this does not' b'seem to be the case.' b'' b'' b'--' b'sean philip (shlomo) engelson' b'yale department of computer science' b'box yale station' b'new haven, ct
