b'' b'' b'' b'i wish i had the figures with me to back me up, but i recall' b'statistics showing that women tended to have more accidents than men' b'but the damage was generally quite minor. men had fewer but far more' b'expensive accidents. the rate of total vehicle destruction was' b'*significantly* higher for men than women, particularly in the younger' b'male age groups.' b'' b'imho social considerations are probably the strongest influence here,' b'possibly more so than any difference between the sexes. social' b"influences often affect the type of car that's bought and the" b'situations the car is used in, and the type of car and driving' b'situations have a major effect on accident risk. thus if society' b"expects you to buy a mustang and race it on the street you're more" b'likely to do it, and our society expects that of males more than' b'females.' b'' b'i agree with some of your social influences, such as driving conditions,' b"but lets get real here. guys don't drag race becuase there expected too," b'we do it becuase its fun! (and we find out whose car is faster).' b'guys drive different than women becuase there men. when a driver is' b"driving 'unusually', i can usually figure out if it is a male or female" b'driver without looking at the driver.' b'social influences may give a person more reason to buy a vehicle that' b'has a certain amount of character which he or she would like associated' b'with. do you change your driving habits when no one is around?' b'' b"sheesh! i don't know what kind of women they have where you guys live," b'but there are some ladies here who will blow your doors off. or at least' b"they will try to, but we just can't let the youngsters get too uppity" b'with us old folks b'my b'mark b.' b'' b'jim frost' b'bob' b''
