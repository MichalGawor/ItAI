b'' b'' b' b' i ask this question because there is a tradition, and one that' b' is highly regarded by many people, that several hundred jews' b' elected to throw themselves off a cliff at masada rather than' b' submit to roman rule. the circumstances at masada and those at' b' waco would seem in general terms quite similar, and yet so far' b" as i'm aware nobody has seriously suggested that the jews were" b' insane.' b'' b' as has already been pointed out, the jews faced a totally' b' different fate at the hand of the romans than did koresh' b' at the hand of the feds. the jewish men would most likely' b' have been crucified, the the women and children sold into' b' slavery. one can well argue that koresh may have *thought*' b' that a similar fate awaited him, but there was scant rational' b' basis for that fear, so "insane" seems to describe any such' b' belief.' b'' b'what is the penalty if convicted of murdering federal agents' b'in texas? the death penalty.' b'' b' none of which excuses the reckless action of the feds, who' b' allegedly believing they were dealing with a nut, should' b' have exercise much more restraint. indeed, given their' b' *stated* goals of saving the children, one might also apply' b' the moniker "insane" to the feds\' actions.' b'' b'yup.' b'--' b'russ anderson disclaimer: any statements are my own and do not reflect' b'------------------ upon my employer or anyone else.
