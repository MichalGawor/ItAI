b'' b'i am making a search for a cad program that does a decent job' b'of making schematic drawings. the program needs to be in' b'ms-dos, windows if possible.' b'' b'what i want the cad program to do is to draw diagrams by' b'dragging elements onto the screen, and in this the elements' b'needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ics (case with pins).' b'it also needs to have provision for adding legends to the' b'components as well as their values. in other words i want to' b'produce quality drawings. printout would be to either pin' b'dot-matrix and/or laser printer.' b'' b'i would suggest draw for windows (by micrografx). i have this on my' b'home box. its quite impressive and only cost ukl100. it has a rather' b'nice clip-art library facility which you can expand with your own' b'drawings. there is no circuit component clip-art included, but you' b'could add your own quite easily.' b'' b'it works with any windows printer driver of course, and can also' b'export embedded postscript and pcx files.' b'' b'note: i am not connected with micrografx in any way.' b'' b'paul.' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------' b'these ideas and others like them can be had gec-marconi research is not' b'for each from any reputable idealist. responsible for my opinions'
