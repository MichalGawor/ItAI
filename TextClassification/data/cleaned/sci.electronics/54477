b'' b'does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data i/o (print spooler,' b'digital sampling, etc.) would be better implemented with a dma chip or a' b'dedicated microcontroller? essentially what i am trying to decide is the best' b'way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a' b'memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use' b'by the smart data i/o.' b'' b'which dma or microcontroller chip would be best to use? fast, cheap, and easy' b"to obtain would be nice, but i won't limit my choices to only those that fit" b'those characteristics. even an (under would do what i want,' b'but i am sure there is a better alternative like a microcontroller with' b'onchip (e)eprom.' b'' b'so i essentially want to hear about all dma and microcontrollers that are simple' b'to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a' b'few i/o lines.' b''
