b'' b'i have a 486/50mhz isa board with 256kbyte cache and megs' b'ram. i just bought the new soundblaster and tried to' b'install the card. the sb16 uses 16bit dma channel.i could' b'select between channel to it is the first card i ever' b'installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. after i tested' b'the card the first time, the computer crashed and i got a' b'parity error-system halted. this happens either from dos as' b'also from windows. so it seems that my bit dma channels' b'are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe' b'recocnize them and tests them ok until first access).' b'' b'well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a' b'special test program for dma problems? i eliminated the' b'problem temporaly by using only bit dma channel but it' b'makes the system slow!' b'' b'thanks for your help.' b'yours markus' b'' b'' b''
