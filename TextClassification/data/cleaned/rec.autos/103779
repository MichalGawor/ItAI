b'' b"i still can't understand all the hype about the impalla ss, it still has" b'the ugly caprice body (orca on wheels). the caprice was the worst new' b'body style to come out of detroit ever! now just because the lt1 engine' b'and a few suspension tweeks are being added.' b'' b'its still ugly, its still a barge. gm\'s answer to everything is "throw in' b'a v8 and someone will buy it." or "add some plastic ground affects' b'and a few stickers and call it a gt, gtz or ss, and someone will buy it."' b'' b'imho gm needs to scrap the caprice body completely and start over with a' b'blank sheet of paper. no minor modification (wheel well treatments, tail' b'amp modification, or nose re-design or even the lt1 engine) will help' b'the existing caprice.' b'' b'jeff'
