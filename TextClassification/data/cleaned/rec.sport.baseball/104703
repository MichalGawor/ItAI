b'' b"tim shippert recently posted summaries of last year's defensive average" b'stats in terms of the linear weights estimated run-value of defensive' b"performances, compared to league average. i've combined those with my" b'position-adjusted mlv numbers to come up with first-approximation total' b'run values for players last year. we can use these as a springboard for' b'reconsideration of the mvp award.' b'' b'major caveats: these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if' b'san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the' b'infield, that will cause some inaccuracies. the offensive numbers are' b'position-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and' b"inflate others to be fair. finally, we still don't know what to do about" b'catchers, and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions' b'of tony phillips and bip roberts.' b'' b"having said that, there are still some surprises. let's look national" b'league first. all numbers in total runs contributed over the season.' b'' b'player\t\toffense\t\tdefense\t\ttotal' b'' b'sandberg\t 44\t\t 32\t\t b'bonds\t\t 67\t\t 3\t\t b'walker\t\t 26\t\t 26\t\t b'justice\t\t 14\t\t 33\t\t b'daulton\t \t 44\t\t ??\t\t b'larkin\t\t 36\t\t 4\t\t b'grace\t\t 13\t\t 27\t\t b'' b'as i see it, these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season.' b"if you deflate sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley, you" b'get essentially a dead heat. had bonds been his usual defensive self, it' b"wouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case. darren" b'daulton needs or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,' b"and i couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible. a good case" b'could be made for any of sandberg, bonds, or daulton as top dude.' b'' b'my personal vote: bonds, sandberg, daulton, walker, justice.' b'' b'' b'in the american league:' b'' b'player\t\toffense\t\tdefense\t\ttotal' b'' b'ventura\t\t 22\t\t 34\t\t b'martinez\t 47\t\t -1\t\t b'b. anderson \t 21\t\t 25\t\t b'thomas\t\t 47\t\t -5\t\t b'r. henderson\t 25\t\t 16\t\t b'raines\t\t 17\t\t 23\t\t b'tettleton\t 33\t\t ??\t\t b'' b"ok, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked robin ventura as top" b"player in the al last year? i certainly didn't, but i'd have a hard time" b'arguing against him at this point. yes, i know these numbers are only' b"approximate, but that's a big gap between him and the guy. also, those" b'of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds.' b'' b"once again, there's a catcher in the ointment. if calling a game is as" b'important as it might be, runs is easy to make up (or give away). take' b"a guess, folks; i don't think we can do any better than that." b'' b'my personal vote (excluding pitchers):' b'' b'ventura, tettleton, anderson, martinez, henderson.' b'' b"i'm a big frank thomas fan, but i have to admit to a bias in favor of" b'balanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher' b'leverage in w/l record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with' b'negative defense.' b'' b'for the record:' b'' b'carlos baerga\t\t 27\t\t 5\t\t b'roberto alomar\t\t 35\t\t -2\t\t b'' b"forget it; it's a wash." b'' b'let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding' b"don mattingly's defense this past season. don recovered brilliantly from his" b"weak and to end up with" b'' b'mattingly\t\t -1\t\t 17\t\t runs' b'' b"which is clearly an above-average first baseman. however, it's still runs" b'behind mark mcgwire, runs behind frank thomas, and runs behind john' b"olerud. on the other hand, it's ahead of rafael palmeiro, cecil fielder, and" b'every other al first baseman not yet mentioned.' b'' b'--' b'member iie, orsa, tims, sabr hands not soft, eye not discerning' b'| and in denver they call you a slugger?' b'"the big catullus" galarraga and compare you to my own mattingly!?'
