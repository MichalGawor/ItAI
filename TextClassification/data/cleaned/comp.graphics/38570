b'' b'does anyone know of software that will allow' b'you to convert coreldraw (.cdr) files' b'containing bitmaps to scodal, as this is the' b"only format our bureau's filmrecorder recognises." b'' b'jeff lyall' b'' b'i used this combination for a while a qcr-z recorder,' b'i think and as far as i remember corel can export in' b"scodal (.scd) format. just select 'export' on the main" b'file menu. this may not be implemented in earlier versions,' b"of course, in which case you're on your own!!!" b'' b'also, i seem to think that the s/w for the qcr-z (at the time)' b'did strange (and very undesirable) things if any part of the' b'pic was outside the screen area on corel. i once spent an' b'afternoon painfully discovering that one pixel had somehow' b'strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!' b'' b"the qcr-z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill b'so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then' b'grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the' b'final slide as a circle (i think) and totally ignores the' b'shape of the object being filled!!!' b'' b"of course, if the recorder isn't a qcr, you can ignore all" b'this and feel suitably b'' b'cheers, toby.' b'____________________________________._.____._.__________._.__________._.______' b'____________________________________! b'___! b'___! toby freeman b'___! glasgow university b'___!____________________________!___! b'____________________________________!_!____!_!__\\____/__!_!_!_____/___\\___!___' b''
