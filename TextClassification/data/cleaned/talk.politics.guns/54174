b'' b'' b'-' b'- again, my response is, "so what?" is mr. rutledge arguing that since' b'- the local and federal governments have abandoned their charter to support' b'- such activity, and passed laws prohibiting private organizations from' b'- doing so, that they have eliminated the basis for the rkba? on the' b'- contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it.' b'' b'no, i originally argued that the second amendment was "a little bit' b'and an anachronism." these prohibiting laws are examples why the are' b'an anachronism. after all, laws in made by representatives of the' b'people. these representatives of the people have already decided' b'that the second amendment does not apply or is too broad in some' b'cases. since these representatives feel an unconditional' b'interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority' b'of the people feel the same way. if this is so, it is an example' b'of the people using their power of government. if this is not' b'how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.' b'' b"i'll point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment" b'process was to require a super-majority to change the supreme law,' b'making it impossible for a "majority" of the people to simply change' b'the law on a whim. simply changing the meaning based on "the' b'representatives" of the people effectively destroys the amendment' b"process. the state's, you know, are also entitled to a say under" b'that process.' b'' b' mox nix, mr. rutledge. you are the only one here claiming that the' b'- rkba is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated' b'- militia. why this is a false assumption has already been posted a' b'- number of times.' b'' b'no, i simple stated that the people have a right to "join a well' b'organized militia."' b'' b"i'll note that that right could be considered protected under" b"the first amendment's protection of peaceful assembly. unless" b"you would consider a militia inherently non-peaceful, then they've" b'stated the same thing twice.' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group' b"your pushed me down the elevator shaft; i'm beginning to think you don't" b'love me anymore."
