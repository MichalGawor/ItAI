b'' b'' b'' b'oh yeah...and i can go to the arena and see not one, not two, but' b'*six* championship banners hanging from the rafters. stanley cup' b'banners, and avco cup banners. my nhl guide says that vancouver has' b"won the cup once (as many times as the rockin' town of kenora has won it!)" b'' b"don't let this confuse anybody. the winnipeg jets have never won the" b'stanley cup (or even come that close). these stanley cup championships' b'go back a long way to about the turn of the century. the winnipeg' b"victorias won one or more of these cups- the jets didn't win any of" b'them.' b'' b'can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff' b'series going on today than who won more stanley cups around the turn' b'of the century??' b'' b'lets face facts. the canucks are leading the series the canucks' b'dominated the jets in their season series. the canucks did better in' b'the regular season than winnipeg. who is the better team? i think' b'that the facts show that vancouver is better than winnipeg.' b'' b'gregmeister'
