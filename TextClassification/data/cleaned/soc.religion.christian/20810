b'' b'' b'jesus was born a jew. we have biblical accounts of' b"both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back" b'to david. it seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that jesus' b'was semitic.' b"as an interesting aside, jesus' being semitic makes him" b'neither "white" nor "black," and in some sense underscores the' b'point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his' b'message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate' b'on.' b'finally, i would direct anyone interested in african' b'involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of' b"the ethiopian eunuch in acts chapter (i think it's chapter" b'9). this is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,' b'treasurer to the queen of the ethiopians, was definitely' b'african. because "ethiopia" at that time indicated a region' b'just south of egypt, many also speculate that this man was not' b'only the first african christian, but the first black christian' b'as well.' b'god bless,' b'charles campbell'
