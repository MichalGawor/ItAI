b'' b'{michael fulbright} said' b'"analog switches/balanced"' b'to <all on b"mf i am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and i've hit a snag." b'mf in my application i want to be able to change the gain of an' b'mf op amp amplifier from to controlable via a digital input.' b"mf the most obvious way i've come up with is to use analog switches" b'mf to adjust the gain of the op amp. the only analog switch i have' b'mf experience with it the unfortunately i want to switch an' b'mf ac signal which goes from about -5v to 5v, and the is only' b'mf for positive signals.' b'' b'how about using a it has a seperate ground for the' b'analog outputs. it would get you bits.' b'' b'mf another part which caught my eye was the analog devices ad630. this' b'mf is a balanced demodulator which appears to fill exactly the need i' b'mf have. the data sheet was somewhat skimpy on application notes. could' b'mf someone comment on using this chip for the following application?' b'' b'or how about a multiplying d/a convertor? this is' b'essentiallty what you are makeing.' b'' b'' b'mangled on fri at b'' b'... catch the blue wave!' b'---' b'* blue wave/qwk v2.12 b''
