b'' b"i've spent the past week tearing my hair out, trying to get the output of" b'a piped "tail -f" to end up in a widget. i\'ve managed to make it work in' b"some ugly ways, but either a) x blocks on the tail and won't allow user" b'input, b) the "tail -f" functions like just "tail" and doesn\'t follow the' b'expansion of the file, c) the "tail -f" doesn\'t die after i\'ve closed' b'the pipe and destoryed the widget, or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting' b'for tail to die.' b'i _know_ this code has to exist. anybody have it? a general' b"popen() case would be perfered but at this point i'll take anything..." b'thanks.' b'--'
