b'' b'' b'in an attempt to do animation with pov i have created two little' b'programs. one is a c program that will perform a "morph" between' b'any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. and then' b'it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out' b'to a file. then i have a perl script that will read the list of functions' b'and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. i had hoped this would' b'let me do simple animation. however, i have discovered that simply' b'performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary' b'object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. now i know' b'an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the' b'origin perform the rotation and then move it back but i know there' b'must be another way around this. i had thought perhaps it was because' b'i had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new' b'point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. however' b'this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. any help is' b'appreciated.' b'' b''
