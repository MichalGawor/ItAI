b'' b'short summary of what bellovin says hellman says the nsa says: there is' b'a global key g, plus one key u_c for each chip c. the user can choose a' b'new session key k_p for each phone call p he makes. chip c knows three' b"keys: g, its own u_c, and the user's k_p. the government as a whole" b'knows g and every u_c. apparently a message m is encrypted as' b"e_g(e_{u_c}(k_p),c) e_{k_p}(m). that's it." b'' b"the system as described here can't possibly work. what happens when" b'someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? to get m' b'the receiving chip needs k_p; to get k_p the receiving chip needs u_c.' b'the only information it can work with is c. if u_c can be computed' b'from c then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key' b"escrow'' is bullshit. otherwise how is a message decrypted?" b'' b'---dan'
