b'' b'' b" let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole. it races, ever faster," b'towards the even horizon. but, thanks to the curving of space caused by the' b'excessive gravity, as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to' b'travel. integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of b'infinity. so the math says that nothing can enter a black hole.' b'' b'this is not correct. the event horizon is not the "center" of the black' b'hole but merely the distance at which the escape velocity is equal to the' b'speed of light. that is, the event horizon is a finite radius...' b'' b'keith'
