b'' b'npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy (name possibly' b'garbled by me), an official historian for the cia. she has won an emmy' b'for research on moe berg for a tv documentary (which i know from nothing' b'but which sounds good). she said that among other things, berg was the' b"principal spy for the oss (cia's wwii precursor) spying on axis atomic" b'programs, because of his physics background and language skills. she said' b'that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland, and had' b'instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb' b"research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him)." b'(i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb' b"program, but i don't know how reliable this is.) unfortunately, npr didn't" b"mention any kind of a book she's writing i'd certainly buy it." b'' b"(in case you're wondering about baseball relevance, berg was a longtime" b'mlb backup catcher. he was a member of an mlb all-star team that toured' b'japan in presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because' b'he was one of the few americans, much less mlb players, who spoke japanese.' b'photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids,' b'according to mccarthy.)' b'' b'dave mb' b''
