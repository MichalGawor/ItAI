b'' b'' b"jj i am considering buying a used taurus sho. the car in" b'jj question has 37k miles. i took it for a test drive the other day' b'jj and a few questions came up.' b'jj' b'jj b'jj second, is there anything i should specifically look for in an' b'jj sho of this vintage? anything i should specifically ask abt?' b'jj (brakes, cluthch, etc.) i noticed on the drive the clutch engagemen' b'jj point seemed a little high; since all my other cars are auto-tragics' b"jj i'm not sure abt this point. i had my foot firmly planted on the" b'jj brake when i started it up. there was a bit of a pop in the pedal' b"jj soon after the engine started. this also occured on a few t-bird sc'" b'jj i test drove. was this the abs self test?' b'' b'brake rotors and the clutch are the main things. there has been a clutch' b'replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible,' b'as it is a change well worth making. you can also swap the cruddy cable' b"shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll" b'cost you some b'' b'my brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably' b"normal. didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting." b'' b'what kind of tires does the car have on it?' b'' b'---' b'* winqwk 2.0b#131 for a good time dial on your sho. b''
