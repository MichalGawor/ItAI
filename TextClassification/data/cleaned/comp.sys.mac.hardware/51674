b'' b'i have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the mhz clock and a higher' b"speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different" b'speeds. there was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but' b'if the si uses timing loops anything like a quadra for accessing its floppy' b'drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. a quadra must reboot after having its' b'clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its' b'floppy drive.' b''
