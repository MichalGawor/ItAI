b'' b'' b"i'm an new to this. having found some files (public) to look into, i" b"ftp'ed them to a system i have access to. i then used kermit to transmit" b'them via modem to my host computer, a pc-based file system. i access' b'internet through modem access to a university mainframe. from the pc' b'file server, i pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk' b'to a sgi indigo (the sgi is not networked yet). when i try to uncompress' b'and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or i get an error' b'in the tar process about directories being invalid.' b"what i'm wondering about is the transfer of unix files (compressed," b'binary,ascii) about multiple platforms. my guess is that it is the copy' b"to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up. any help is appreciated." b'bob'
