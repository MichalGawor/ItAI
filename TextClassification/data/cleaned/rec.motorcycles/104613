b'' b'now the bike is off warranty, i finally replaced the stock items on my' b'softail custom with the title ones. installation was pretty easy in' b'both cases, even for a fairly non-mechanical chemist type dude like me!' b'i discovered the limitations of my tool collection, but had fun buying' b'and making the requisite tools!' b'' b'mc ignitions power arc ii single fire ignition: easy to install, but' b'read the wiring diagram carefully! setting the static timing was a' b'piece of cake. once installed, i have found easier starting, smoother' b'idle, and more power, plus a more satisfying (to me) bass note in the' b'exhaust register...a lovely whompa-whompa-whompa idle b'the folks at mc ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions on' b'the phone..... a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product.' b'' b's&s super e carb: installation easy, once i hacked down an allen wrench' b'to a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. tunes like' b'a dream, just like they say! the stock carb (non-adjustable) was so' b'lean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and even' b'backfiring into the intake manifold. the super e is terrific, no' b'hesitation in any gear, and my plugs are a lovely tan color with no' b'need to rejet from the factory settings!' b'' b'i know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchers' b'out there, but i had my bike in so many pieces this weekend i began to' b'get worried. but it all went back together again, and runs like a' b'dream, so i am feeling pretty happy.' b'' b'now all i have to do is install my bub pipes and try to pass the nh' b'noise gestapo test!' b'' b'' b"russ hughes fxstc dod# 6022(10e20)" b'"love ...yeah, that\'s the feeling you get when you like something' b'as much as your motorcycle."' b'--sonny barger'
