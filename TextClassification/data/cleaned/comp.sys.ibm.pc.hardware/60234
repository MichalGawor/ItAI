b'' b'' b'' b'ok..... thanks to all of you who responded to my post.' b'here\'s the "official" response from orchid..' b'orchid is aware of the problem, the new rev of the board (rev d) should (not would) take care of the problem. production was scheduled to start' b'on april i have no confirmation that production did start on this day' b'just the word of the tech on the other line.' b'' b'now the flame......' b'you would think a company like orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs.' b'very poor tech support (the first times i called i must have spoke with the' b'janitor because they where talking craziness) the last time i talked to a tech named "paul" and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on.' b'until these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy' b'or recommend orchid products.' b'' b'flame off.....' b'' b'again thanks to all of you who answered my post.' b'' b'terry' b''
