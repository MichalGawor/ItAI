b'' b'hello, i am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this' b'question, however, here i go.. i am a commercial fisherman and i' b'fell about weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke or' b'cracked a rib and wrenched and bruised my back and left arm.' b'my question, i have been to a doctor and was told that it was' b'best to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect, and' b'indeed i am about better, however, the work i do is very' b'hard and i am still not able to go back to work. the thing that worries me' b'is the movement or "clunking" i feel and hear back there when i move' b'certain ways... i heard some one talking about the rib they broke' b'years ago and that it still bothers them.\xff. any opinions?' b'thanx and cheers' b'' b"the old frog's almanac (home of the almanac unix users group)" b'(604) (v32) <public access usenet (2400x4)' b'vancouver island, british columbia waffle xenix
