b'' b'i think a few things are being missed overall here... first of all, anyone' b'with a dos manual can copy a disk, or copy anything (hidden files dont' b'go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely dos ignorant) off' b"of a hard disk. 'professional' crackers aren;t interested in copying disks." b'they are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly' b'listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number' b'dialog boxes, volume label checks, and who knows what when it comes to' b'computer games.' b'' b'those people are in the minority, however. in my experience with the world of' b'people and software, it seems that a good majority of people (say will' b'at some point copy a friend\'s program ("gee, you really oughta try this") or' b'accept a copy. these are people who normally would buy a software package' b"or do without, but decided that just once it wouldn't matter." b'' b'the last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one' b"computer; most people aren't going to spend x# of computers for the" b'same software package.. they will just install it x# of times, especially' b'things like dos upgrades.' b'' b'--' b'|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|' b'| are we having fun yet? b'|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|'
