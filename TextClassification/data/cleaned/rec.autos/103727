b'' b"i agree with jeff's reply. i've never changed the brake fluid except when" b'having a brake job, which is usually at around miles (alot of' b'freeway driving). however, i will start to do this as preventative' b'maintenance on my new car. also, there are brake system flushing agents' b'that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the' b"system, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended not to use them unless" b'you are certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent. just for' b'your info, i was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for' b"flushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so i don't" b'know if it was more without the brake job. this is in the s.f bay area.'
