b'' b'if it were a sin to violate sunday no one could' b'ever be forgiven for that for jesus never kept sunday holy. he only' b'recognized one day of the seven as holy.' b'jesus also recognized other holy days, like the passover. acts says' b'that no more should be layed on the gentiles than that which is necessary.' b'the sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people' b'to keep the 7th day, while christians were living among people who did not' b'keep the 7th day. it looks like that would have been a problem.' b'instead, we have scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike' b'(romans and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of' b'food we eat, jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath. (col. b'the' b'question is "on what authority do we proclaim that the requirements of the' b'fourth commandment are no longer relevant to modern christians?"' b"i don't think that the sabbath, or any other command of the law is totally" b'irrelevant to modern christians, but what about collosions where it says' b'that we are not to be judged in regard to the keeping of the sabbath?' b'' b'why are you running away from the word of jesus? has somebody superseded' b"the word of jesus? if you don't follow the morality of the ten" b'commandments and the law and the prophets and the word of jesus, whose' b'morality do you follow?'
