b'' b'living things maintain small electric fields to enhance certain' b'chemical reactions, promote communication of states with in a cell,' b'(3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized' b'example), and perhaps other uses. these electric fields change with location' b'and time in a large organism. special photographic techniques such as applying' b'external fields in kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances' b'caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. perhaps such pictures will' b'be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. perhaps not.' b'' b'studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred' b'years old, but not a popular activity. perhaps, except in the case of a few' b'tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the' b'investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed. there are some' b'hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding' b'the healing of broken bones, but not understood why.' b'' b'bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. ideas such as frankenstein' b'reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as' b"when volta invented the battery. i personally don't care to revert to supernatural" b"cause to explain things we don't yet understand."
