b'' b'since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of' b'approx. posts (going back to: the braves could be better off' b'if an injury happens), i may as well inject a little more' b'fuel to the flame!' b'' b'1) back at the beginning of spring training, i though' b'lopez would make the squad easily. olson was still' b'recovering from his late-season injury (knee, i believe),' b'and there were questions as to whether he would be' b'able to play before june. and then berryhill was dinged up.' b'' b'i was looking forward to this, because i believe that lopez' b'can hit and field the position. before last season, he was' b'the braves "defensive catcher" prospect, while brian deak was' b'the braves "offensive catcher" prospect. besides, olson' b"and berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard" b"box, and don't walk enough to be useful." b'' b'but olson recovered quickly, berryhill recovered, and the braves went' b'with the two vets. i still say that if one of those two had been down' b"at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back." b'' b'2) there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around.' b'after all, ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and' b'tear. there are teams out there without one average ml catcher' b'(california and seattle come to mind). certainly, trying to' b'move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.' b"plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't" b"tiddleywinks either (i think olson's at about berryhill" b"at but that's only what i recall)." b'' b'3) yes, i think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to' b'play in this also. what is it, that of the 2+year players' b"aren't eligible for arbitration? only the that were on the roster" b'the longest are eligible? of course, the system may change,' b'but the extent of that change is not yet known. from a business' b'standpoint, it may make sense to keep lopez down until june/the' b'first time olson/berryhill go on the dl.' b'' b"4) i am still disappointed that lopez isn't on the team." b'i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves,' b"and the truth is that i'd rather see our best team on the field," b'which, imo, includes lopez.' b'' b"of course,today we play the cubs. hopefully, we won't need him. b'' b'as for the schuerholz/cox conversation, i imagine it went' b"like this: (remember, they've both been gm's)" b'(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)' b'' b"cox: ok, we've sent jones down. his fielding could be a" b'little smoother. besides, blauser can hit ok and his fielding' b'is better than it used to be.' b'' b"schuerholz: well, we'll have to send nieves down too. deion" b"just won't sign that baseball only contract. we can't count" b'on him in october, so we have to keep nixon around for the' b"defense. besides, gorman's not ready to give up on" b"billy hatcher yet. once hatcher's gone and deion signs," b'we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez. that ought to' b'give us some pitching depth in b'' b"cox: yep, that'll be nice. too bad deion won't sign." b"ok, i'll look for nieves when justice starts having" b'berry-berry...er, back problems again. now, what about' b'klesko?' b'' b"schuerholz: well, we've still got to fork out another mil" b'for bream. if we keep klesko, we either lose the money' b'or cabrera. i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell,' b"but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same gm. first" b'jeffries for jose, and now whiten for clark! if he' b"gets rid of brian jordan, then i'd have to believe that he" b'and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings!' b'' b"cox: ok, keep trying on bream, and i'll wait til the trading" b'deadline for my hunter/klesko platoon. maybe i can get a few' b'extra at-bats for cabrera while we wait. try california...' b'if snow starts slowly, maybe whiteydal will bite on sid.' b"and if that doesn't work, then perhaps sid's knees" b'could be "persuaded" to act up. there\'s always the' b'15-day dl! mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!' b'' b'schuerholz: what about caraballo?' b'' b"cox: well, he's not that much better than lemke. maybe if he starts" b"in richmond, he'll start walking more. besides, if he's going to be" b'arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually' b'get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.' b'' b"schuerholz: now, let's see. that leaves lopez." b'' b"cox: nooooo! i gotta keep lopez! sure, i didn't think olson" b'would recover this quickly. maybe i can talk caminiti into' b'running into him again?' b'' b"schuerholz: nope, lopez has gotta go. you know that he'll get" b'$3 million in arbitration. may as well put it off that one' b"extra year. besides, until olson's shown his stuff a little" b"bit, i can't trade him. besides, berryhill's a left-handed" b'hitter. you know how rare that is?' b'' b"cox: don't you mean a left-handed whiffer? pretty common," b'if you ask me. i mean, he made pat borders look good in' b'the world series. pat borders!!!' b'' b"schuerholz: hey, you're the one who wouldn't write lopez" b'into the lineup.' b'' b"cox: well, you're the one who went out and got me jeff" b"reardon! besides, i thought lopez wouldn't be used" b"to our pitching staff's stuff. he got some time with" b'them this spring...looked pretty good. come on, surely' b'we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?' b'' b'schuerholz: yeah, but which stiff? whichever one we keep' b'will be hurt by may.' b'' b'cox: ok, ok, you made your point. keep them both. surely' b'one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest. then i' b'can call up lopez, and then we can win games! the pennant!' b"the world series! i'll be up there with john mcgraw! casey" b'stengel! earl weaver! oh, they laughed at me in toronto,' b"but have you ever had to deal with george bell? i'll finally" b'get my just reward! mwa-ha-ha-ha!' b'' b'schuerholz: easy, bobby. have you been taking those' b'"happy pills" left around by chuck tanner? why\'d you' b'ever hire that guy anyhow?' b'' b"cox: don't ask me; ask ted." b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------' b'"i am a marxist, of the groucho sort"' b'grafitti, paris, b'' b'tanstaafl!
