b'' b'' b'i have a question regarding quadras vram. i have tried to find info on this' b'but i could not get precise answers.' b'' b'on one hand, we have a quadra with a monitor, which is capable of' b'32-bit color. how much vram does it have?' b'' b'to display millions of colors on a monitor you need 2mb of vram' b'in the q950.' b'' b'on the other hand, we have a quadra with a monitor, which is capable' b'of 8-bit color only, so it must have ko of vram.' b'' b'correct. this is the amount of on-board vram that the q800 comes' b'with.' b'' b'i would like to take vram simms for the and put them in the so that' b'both machines have 16-bit color capability.' b'is it possible, and if yes, how many vram simms should i take from the b'' b'yes this is possible. technically, you only need to take out of' b'the vram simms but leaving in the other two will not get you anything' b'because the cannot really do anything with 1.5mb of vram. it only' b'knows 1mb and 2mb.' b'' b'from the documentation i have, the quadra must get mo vram to have' b'16-bit color, is that correct?' b'' b'yes, this is correct. you get to 1mb by putting 256k vram simms' b"into the vram simm slots on the q800's motherboard." b'' b'bonus question: where do vram simms hide? from the documentation, they' b'seem to be *behind* the power supply. do i really have to take off the power' b'supply to access the vram simms?' b'' b"yup. you have to take off the power supply. it's only a couple of" b'screws so you should be ok. just make sure that everything is' b'disconnected from it and watch out for static discharges.'
