b'' b' it seems faith is the only tool available for emotional purposes' b" due to the tragedy. as such it maybe fills a need, however i'm" b' getting tired to see children dying in pain in sudan due to lack' b' of food, and assuming that god takes these sufferers to heaven' b' after a painful death.' b' b'' b' if the children are not being fed, whose fault is that? you and i' b' have plenty of food on our tables while others starve. why is that?' b" god gave us this earth to manage. i don't think we're doing a very" b' good job of it. the only consolation i have for those suffering' b' children is that they will be received into the kingdom of heaven' b' where they will never thirst and never hunger again.' b'' b"i agree with your points, and i'm glad to hear that you subscribe" b'to the notion of secular humanism, humans helping humans instead' b'of hoping for a possible deux ex machina solution!' b'' b'as for faith, you could always use such constructs to dampen' b'your anger or sorrow.' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
