b'' b"my old jacket is about to bite the dust so i'm in the market for a new riding" b"jacket. i'm looking for recommendations for a suitable replacement. i would" b"like to buy a full aerostich suit but i can't afford for it right now." b'' b"i'm considering two basic options:" b'' b'1) buy the aerostich jacket only. dunno how much it costs' b"due to recent price increases, but i'd imagine over b'that may be pushing my limit. advantages include the fact' b'that i can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates' b'the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.' b'' b'2) buy some kind of leather jacket. i like a few of the new' b'hein-gericke firstgear line, however they may be a bit pricey' b'unless i can work some sort of deal. advantages of leather' b'are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose' b'value (we all know how important that is possibly cheaper' b'than upper aerostich.' b'' b'requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other' b"layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out" b'lining, it must have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,' b'shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a' b'reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would' b'be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below' b'freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.' b'' b'please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...' b'' b'steve' b'--' b'--' b'1992 ducati i.e. yamaha srx250' b'"life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry..."'
