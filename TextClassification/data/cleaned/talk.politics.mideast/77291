b'' b'date: may b'' b' i find it interesting that mr. major finds the genocide of two' b'million muslims in bosnia acceptable b'' b'' b'now you are actually claiming that muslims have been killed' b'in b-h???' b'' b'please substantiate this utterly ridiculous claim.' b'' b"no, i'm not claiming have been killed. we are in the middle of" b'the genocide process that mr. major has given yet another "green light"' b'to. mladic seems to have most of what he wants, but boban is just' b'getting his appetite whetted. because mladic refuses to allow' b'international observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers' b'in places like foca, brcko, and visegrad, it will be years before we have' b'an accurate account of the number killed.' b'' b'in practical terms, it would be impossible to kill all there' b"just isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and" b'transportation lines that the nazis took years to develop. and' b'remember, the nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied. to' b'actually kill of the population requires extreme genocidal' b'organization.' b'' b'but i do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic' b'annihilation of bosnian muslim culture, by killing as many as is' b'feasible, by rape, by torture, by the demolition of mosques, libraries,' b'and culture artificts, the burning and renaming of villages, the shelling' b"of civilians. so that there won't be any of the or so muslims" b'whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide, though they still' b'may be alive.' b'' b'and mr. major not only finds this acceptable, he helps it along by making' b"sure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves." b'' b'-nick' b'' b'mike.' b'--' b'michael sells, department of religion, haverford college' b'haverford, pa
