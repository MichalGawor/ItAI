b'' b'i am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on' b'another machine (both are hp model 750s). the image is created' b'using xcreateimage and xgetimage and displayed with xputimage. the' b'image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because' b'the server on the other machine is using a different colormap.' b'' b'i tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay,' b"performed a table lookup against the new colormap. this didn't work" b"because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap." b'' b'is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or' b'is there a simpler way to solve this problem? i tried using xinitcolormap' b"but couldn't get that to work either." b'' b'any help would be appreciated.' b'' b'--------------------------------------' b'don lemoine' b'naval surface warfare center' b'dahlgren division' b'dahlgren, va b'(703)663-7917' b''
