b'' b'my wife and i are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our' b'first child (due june 15th). we interviewed a young doctor last week' b'and were very impressed with her. however, i discovered that she is' b'actually not an medical doctor (m.d.) but rather a "doctor of' b'osteopathy" (d.o.). what\'s the difference? i believe the pediatrician' b"*i* went to for many years was a d.o. and he didn't seem different from" b"any other doctor i've seen over the years." b'' b'my dictionary says that osteopathy is "a medical therapy that emphasizes' b'manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought' b'to cause disease and inhibit recovery."' b'' b'jeez, this sounds like chiropractic. i remember getting shots and' b"medicine from *my* pediatrician d.o., and don't remember any" b'"manipulative techniques". perhaps someone could enlighten me as to' b"the real, practical difference between an m.d. and a d.o. also, i'm" b'interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who' b'follows one or the other medical philosophy.' b'' b"i do not read this group regularly and probably won't see your response" b"if you just post it here. sorry for the cross-posting, but i'm hoping" b"there's some expertise here." b'' b'a t d h v a a n n k c s e' b'' b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' b'scott d. brenner at&t consumer communications services' b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'
