b'' b'the cited passages are covered in depth in a faq for this group.' b"that particular faq (i've forgotten the author) discusses the" b'traditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and' b'indicates which points have strong textual support.' b'' b'perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for' b'retrieving the faq on this topic?' b'' b'btw, this issue, while dealt with before, is very timely. one' b'of the major presbyterian churches in california (st. andrews a' b'megachurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of' b'synod (amounts to about of the budget of the synod, which' b'covers all of southern ca and hawaii) until support for a' b'pro-homosexual lobbying group (the lazarus project) is terminated.' b'[this came from a news report on cnn yesterday corrections welcome.]' b'tim' b'' b"[i think it's time for me to post the faq." b'' b'this is an issue throughout the presbyterian church. on the other' b'side, one of the major churches in cincinnati has been ordaining' b'homosexual elders, and has ignored presbytery instructions not to do' b'so. and the church in rochester where the judicial commission said' b"they couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an" b'"evangelist". these situations, as well as the one you describe, do' b'not appear to be stable. this will certainly be a major topic for the' b"general assembly next month. if the church can't come up with a" b"solution that will let people live with each other, i think we're end" b"up with a split. clearly neither side wants that, but i think we'll" b'get pushed into it by actions of both sides.' b'' b'--clh]'
