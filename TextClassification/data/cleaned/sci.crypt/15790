b'' b'i just joined this group recently and really do not know much about' b'cryptography, but a couple things came to mind while reading through' b'the posts.' b'' b'1. is the clipper chip going to be exported? if not, how will' b'people communicate with other countries? will they have to do' b'that in un-crypt-mode. will other encryption techniques be' b'legal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when' b'going overseas, but not within the states?' b'' b"2. i've read about authentication systems that use an electronic" b'security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted' b'pin based on the time/date. the host system has the algorithm' b'built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user.' b'is there some form of encryption technology that would create' b'keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time? the' b'systems would then allow a "window" of time around this instant' b'where the key would work.' b'i realize that this technique would increase the amount of information' b'needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather' b'than just keys. but for smaller scale things it might work.' b'could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that' b'are issued to police/fbi/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week' b'(for instance). if further surveilance was needed, they would have' b'to go back to the escrow service to get another key. this would' b'make it useless for local police to database keys they have used.' b'' b'i assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need' b'to be able to decypher the message. but any thoughts on the subject?' b'' b'thanks,' b'tauren mills' b'' b'tauren mills'
