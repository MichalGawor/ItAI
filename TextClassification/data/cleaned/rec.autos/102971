b'' b'anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of' b"those car hunters? i'm selling a dodge stealth r/t and i was contacted" b'by this company called the markham group based out of illinois.' b'' b"they said they have buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't" b'be talking to me. they talked to me for a good minutes asking everything' b'about my car and said they could sell it no problem. they guaranteed that if' b"they didn't sell my car in days, i would get my money back and since" b"i charged it, i'm protected by federal law which states that if i'm not satisfied," b'i would get a refund (which is true). they federal expressed all the paperwork' b'to me which had a contract stating their policy about the days and such.' b'' b'i called up the bbb in illinois and they do not have a file on them which is' b"good news. so they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's been" b'over week and i have gotten nothing. so how effective are these types of' b'companies? anybody care to share their experiences?'
