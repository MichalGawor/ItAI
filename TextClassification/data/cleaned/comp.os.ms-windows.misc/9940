b'' b' ok, i have a 486dx50(isa) w/ diamond stealth vram 1mb.' b' i was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows.' b" but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in dos' vga," b' especially this new strike commander. b' this stealth vram can only give me fps. (i use 3dbench).' b' my winmark was million, i think.' b'' b" so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully" b' can perform approx same w/ my current vram in windows and also' b" can perform dos' vga preferably 30fps." b'' b'' b'i am ordering the actix graphicsengine ultra plus. it is the same price' b'as the stealth card. plus it is also based on s3 chip the newest and' b'fastest chip from s3.' b'everyone, if you are looking for a card, see the april issue of pc magazine' b'for their review.' b"they noted this person's problem with dos. the stealth card is not a very good" b'dos performer. the actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local' b'bus). it got glowing reports from the magazine (was a best buy) and i called' b'them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week! they have' b'a bulletin board to get the latest drivers.' b'though somone posted that this bbs was at b'' b'at any rate, the actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards' b'in the class (based on the winmark results).' b'' b'if you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance check out' b'the actix card. their number is b'' b'p.s. the article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie:' b'games) then you should also check out the chip from s3. it apparently' b'scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the chip' b'(ie: stealth and actix cards.) they have "comparable" windows performance and' b'are cheaper to buy.' b'' b'eric'
