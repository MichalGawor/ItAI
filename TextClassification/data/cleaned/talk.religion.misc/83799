b'' b'i addressed most of the key issues in this very long lines) post' b'by dean kaflowitz in two posts yesterday. the first was made into the' b'title post of a new thread, "is dean kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?"' b'and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread' b'' b'"a chaney post, and a challenge, reissued and revised"' b'' b'both only in talk.abortion, but i am posting its contents into' b'talk.religion.misc as soon as i exit here.' b'' b'this should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so. the' b'second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us.' b'the first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as' b'kaflowitzdebatingpoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both' b'talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to' b'talk.abortion alone. his lame excuse for the latter policy is that' b'he gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow' b'talk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not' b'also setting his newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone.' b'' b'peter nyikos' b'' b'' b''
