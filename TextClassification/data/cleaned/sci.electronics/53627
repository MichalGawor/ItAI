b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i just canceled my support of the cable regime and i would like to at' b'least pick up the networks and nbc. i do not have tons of' b'money nor even a few pounds so what i am looking for is the best solution' b'for reception for under dollars. i have seen modules that you plug' b'into your wall outlet that "supposedly" make your entire house an' b'antenna. i have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength' b'and aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for "excellent' b'reception" at best. i\'ll try anything, though, if it works. i am in' b'a non-mountainous area, approximately miles from the transmitting stations' b'which are pretty large (montgomery alabama pop. and colombus goergia,' b'pop. any recommendations of products, brand-names, prices and' b'company info (catalog ordering numbers, addresses etc.)? thank you in' b'advance.' b'' b''
