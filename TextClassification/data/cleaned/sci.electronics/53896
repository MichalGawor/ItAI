b'' b'fyi: the actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an hp' b'deskjet is 1/600th inch. the electronics and dynamics of the ink' b'cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at per inch.' b'on almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.' b'' b'the method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer' b'results in much less spread than ink drop technology.' b'' b"it doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and" b'electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than' b'inexpensive ink jet printers. recall also that laser printers' b'offer a much higher throughput: ppm for a laser versus about b'ppm for an ink jet printer.' b'' b'something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the' b'life of the printer. a page yield toner cartridge is about' b'$us at discount while hp high capacity page yield)' b'cartridges are about $us at discount. it could be that over the' b'life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are' b'less than ink jet printers. it is getting progressively closer' b'between the two technologies. laser printers are usually desinged' b'for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product' b'replacement cycles.' b'' b'' b'--' b'bill mayhew neoucom computer services department' b'rootstown, oh usa phone:
