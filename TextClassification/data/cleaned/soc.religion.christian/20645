b'' b'' b' i disagree with your claim that jews were not evangelistic (except in' b' the narrow sense of the word). jewish proselytism was widespread.' b' there are numerous accounts of jewish proselytism, both in the new' b' testament and in roman and greek documents of the day.' b'' b'jim,' b'' b'please feel free to correct me and give me some texts. as far as i can see the' b'only text which vaugely relates to jewish evangelism is found in mt. b'however since this is found only in mt. it cannot be dated before 90ce which' b'makes it unusefull for understanding second temple judaism.' b'' b'randy'
