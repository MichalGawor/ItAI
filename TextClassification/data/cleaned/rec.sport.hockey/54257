b'' b' buffalo is up is the series with boston, and the reason....grant fuhr b" fuhr is playoff hungry, and he's proving once again why they call him" b' money goaltender. fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the' b" league anymore (statistically at least), but he's proving that he can" b' make the big save at the right time.' b' the leafs should have kept fuhr, and probably would have had a chance' b' against powerhouse detroit. but again.......where was andreychoke in game b'' b'i applauded the sabres for making the deal to get fuhr, specifically because i' b"thought it would help them win at least one playoff series. however, i don't" b'think the leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that felix' b"won't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come." b'' b'anyway, does anybody else find it ironic that fuhr is up against moog? (or at' b'least he was until a guy named alex showed up....:-) b'' b'' b'--'
