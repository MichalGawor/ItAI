b'' b'' b'' b'q: suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on' b' a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation... [etc]' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\' b'great... nice choice of bad guys to' b'convince everyone how "bad" unrestricted' b'encryption is. why not use a child' b'molester instead? of course, the word' b'*suspect* is never used here, so i guess' b'these people have already been convicted' b'and are operating this drug ring from' b'their jail cells.' b'' b'how about *this* question instead?' b'' b'q: suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on' b'a political opponent of a senior administration official and' b'intercepts a conversation...' b'' b"kinda changes your interpretation of the event, doesn't it? and yes," b'the presence of the clipper chip does change things, because it will' b'not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security,' b'it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification' b'to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them.' b"dang it all, it's supposed to be inconvenient (but not impossible)." b"that's the only sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while" b'still allowing legitimate law enforcement access.' b'' b'' b'q: how strong is the security in the device? how can i be sure' b' how strong the security is?' b'' b'a: this system is more secure than many other voice encryption' b' systems readily available today. while the algorithm will' b' remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow' b' system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of' b' cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all' b' potential users that there are no unrecognized' b' vulnerabilities.' b'' b"uh huh... sure. i predict that within two months (weeks?) of the chip's" b'debut, the full technical details will be posted to sci.crypt. and if' b"this has any impact on the security of the key escrow system, then we've" b'been lied to. any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light' b'of public scrutiny, and there is no way you can be sure that an' b'algorithm has no "unrecognized vulnerabilities" unless you have half' b'the world trying to break it for a decade or so. even then, you gotta' b'be careful.' b'' b'' b'michael t. palmer "a man is crazy who writes a secret in any' b'ripem key on server from the vulgar." roger bacon, b''
