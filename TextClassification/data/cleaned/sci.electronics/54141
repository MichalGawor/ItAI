b'' b"i strongly disagree. i think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't" b'copy the program if "diskcopy" can\'t do it.' b'' b'i hate to disagree, but i will. b"(note: i don't pirate software, nor do i trade it. i simply have met and" b"talked extensively with those who have. that's it. the fbi can tap someone" b"else's phone b"most pirating is done by people who don't use the programs they pirate." b'a cracked program tends to get passed on, resplendant in the various graphics' b'and animations that advertise whoever performed the modification(s).' b'' b"i admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving'" b"copies of programs to one's fellow workers, maybe taking it home for use" b"on one's own pc, but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most" b'spread throughout the business as a whole- how many times have you had' b'someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks?' b'' b"it's mostly a matter of convenience: a person sees a program they want to" b'use and they feel justified in making a copy since "someone\'s already paid' b'for it", etc., etc. (a note: this is starting to change a bit. not much' b'though.)' b'' b"if you're talking a max goal of pirated copies, i bet that anything that" b"will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will" b'suffice.' b'' b'what about commercially available copy programs? copyii?' b"how about programs like teledisk, that can do things diskcopy can't?" b'and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy' b"wouldn't know about this:" b'after working with people around computers, one comes to realize that' b"the 'average' user doesn't know much. any computer enthusiast is at least" b'200x better at pre-guessing commands and how to use them (can *you* sit down' b'and use something without reading the manual?) and it is these people who' b"are doing the pirating', not joe windows user who can't remember a few" b'arguments to the dir command.' b'' b'i hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online *not*' b'because i want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and' b"and convenient than sifting through an old book i can't find." b'' b'really? i find it evens out- the online stuff can be read through faster,' b"but you're stuck reading it in linear flow: start to finish, unless you" b'jump ahead with a search or such. a book, though, you can flip through' b'faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty' b'index too!' b'' b'but i partially agree: i often wish i could grep something that was written' b'down.' b'' b'off deeper end- why does everyone think they need to be able to make a' b'backup copy? almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,' b'so you are left with the originals as your backups. i think its a waste' b'of time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to "lend"' b'out the backups.' b'' b'what if they need to re-install? the idea of a backup still holds- if' b"the original disk goes bad, they're out of luck for about weeks, which" b'is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks-' b"if they'll do it without a charge." b'' b':::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::' b'::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: edward w. jajko b'::::::::::::::::"mein fuhrer! i can walk!!" -doctor strangelove::::::::::::::::' b':::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::'
