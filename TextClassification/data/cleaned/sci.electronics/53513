b'' b'just a shot here, but ya never know:' b'' b'i once bought a (real) cheap equalizer power amp for my car tape player' b'at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great. for a' b'while, that is. then one channel quit entirely. i opened it up, and the' b'amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder' b'joints attaching it to the pcb. i soldered them back and it worked fine.' b'i just had to keep the volume a bit lower than i did before. probably' b'lousy heat sinking.' b'' b'you said "a nice alpine" which i\'m sure is a few orders of mag higher' b'in quality than the p.o.s. i had. but the point is look inside before' b'you scrap it, since you occasionally find something you can repair.' b'maybe even the same thing i found.' b'' b'good luck!'
