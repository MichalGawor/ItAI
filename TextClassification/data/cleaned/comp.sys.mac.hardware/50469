b'' b'' b'my advisor has decided to get a mac for the lab now that we are funded again.' b'' b'the consensus in the lab was that all we really needed was an lciii, but' b'he decided he wanted a centris the lack of an fpu on that machine,' b'and the price, struck me as making it worth less than an lciii, so i have' b'suggested we get a iivx instead. it seems heavily expandable, and for' b'' b"what do people with iivx's think of them? they seem like good machines to" b'me, and i like the nubus slots in case we ultimately decide we want to do' b'work with video on it....' b'' b'the iivx...lciii performance at a centris price. the only reason' b'to get an iivx is if you really need the full-size nubus slots. keep' b'in mind that the supports all apple monitors and has optional ethernet.' b"this lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for nubus cards. and unless" b"you're running fpu-intensive software, the will blow the doors off the" b'lciii and the iivx. the lciii, on the other hand, is sufficient for most' b'people and has a great price.' b'' b"if you haven't guessed, i find halving the bus clock (the iivx 32mhz up vs." b'16mhz bus) a throughly bad thing and i hope apple never does it again.' b'--' b'______________________________________________________________________________' b'|joe finete b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
