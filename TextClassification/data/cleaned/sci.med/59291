b'' b'' b' i was just wondering if exercises specific to particular regions of the' b' body (such as thighs) will basically only tone the thighs, or if fat' b' from other parts of the body (such as breasts) would be affected just as' b' much.' b'' b'there are two different mechanisms here: toning of muscles and reduction of' b'fat. exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles' b'exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching' b'arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers). however, if exercise' b'also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally' b'distributed over the entire body. there is no way to "spot reduce" body fat' b'other than surgically, through liposuction. distribution of body fat is' b'genetically determined. sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like "fat",' b'so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the "fat"' b'is "changing" into "muscle", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally' b'separate, and one does not ever "change into" the other.' b'' b'------------------------' b'philosophy department;wesleyan university;usa'
