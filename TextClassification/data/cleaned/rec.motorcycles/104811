b'' b'unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the corbin gunfighter' b'and lady with passenger backrest for my hawk gt.' b'' b'it came with no instructions, but it came weeks earlier than they' b'said it would. installation would have been very easy, but the seat' b'fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with' b'the stock seat! it never was easy to put on. once i figured that' b'out, the new seat went on the first try. the passenger backrest, though,' b'does not fit as i thought it might. the supplied screw to set the' b'backrest angle does not fit, and i have not yet found a suitable,' b'hard, sae grade or perhaps bolt that fits. there is a' b"a soft bolt in there now just don't lean back." b'' b"the driver's section of the seat is a bit wider. seems comfortable" b'enough, but then again i put about miles on the stock seat' b"without a thought. the passenger's section has about times the" b'volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it' b"seems much more comfortable. the backrest helps a bit, but i've not" b'has enough time to really test it. the backrest also comes with a' b'small pocket. its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the' b'10" taller seat.' b'' b'if i go on the three-notch ride soon dixville, pinkham smugglers),' b"i'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an" b'improvement.' b'--' b'frank evan perdicaro \t\t\t\txyvision color systems' b'legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\t\t101 edgewater drive'
