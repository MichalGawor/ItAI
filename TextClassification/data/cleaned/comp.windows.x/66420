b'' b'i have a program produces a continuous tone by calling xbell' b'repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. if it is' b'run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the x' b'server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program' b'have exited. is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by' b'emptying the x server bell buffer when each program exits?' b'- disclaimer: please note that the above is a personal view and should not' b'be construed as an official comment from the jet project.'
