b'' b'' b'i also understand that the administration is planning to position' b'troops in macedonia. any reaction out there to this?' b'' b'' b'macedonia said yesterday it had neither requested or needs such' b'forces.' b'' b'this is sort of like sending the national guard to bel air when' b'the riot is in south central!' b'' b'obviously, clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes' b'in america rather than to try to deal with the real problem and' b'assume a share of responsibility for the problem. he obviously' b"didn't even consult with the macedonians...he was just looking at" b'the map of the former yugoslavia for the safest place to put' b'american troops so he could say to the europeans...hey, look, we' b'have troops on the ground in the former yugoslavia too...now let' b'me bomb so i can make it look like i am doing something in the' b'american media.' b'' b'the problem is that the blue berets in bosnia are dead meat if' b"clinton starts bombing, but clinton doesn't have the courage to" b'ask that the blue berets leave, because then he becomes primarily' b'responsible to the bosnian policy of the un and the allies.' b'clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feel' b'free to use american military power for the sake of domestic' b"us politics and his domestic image, but he doesn't want to assume" b'the primary international leadership role in the un and among' b'the allies, like bush, for all his faults, did in the gulf war...' b'because with leadership comes responsibility, and clinton seems' b'to want to retain the europeans as scapegoats.' b'' b'clinton wants to leave the europeans in charge and responsible,' b'but wants to freelance on the side...and if his freelancing gets' b'too hot, he wants to be able to cut and run...the american public may' b"be easily fooled...european leaders aren't." b'' b'gerald'
