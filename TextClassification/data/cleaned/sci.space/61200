b'' b'how will said re-boost be done?' b'grapple, hst, stow it in cargo bay, do oms burn to high altitude,' b'unstow hst, repair gyros, costar install, fix solar arrays,' b'then return to earth?' b'' b'actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel' b'reserve during the evas (in case they have to chase down an adrift' b"astronaut or something like that). but yes, you've got the idea the" b'reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.' b'' b'my guess is why bother with usingthe shuttle to reboost?' b'why not grapple, do all said fixes, bolt a small liquid fueled' b'thruster module to hst, then let it make the re-boost...' b'' b"somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf" b'item. nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include' b"attitude control (hst's own is not strong enough to compensate for things" b'like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro' b"data from hst's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you" b"don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible" b'contamination after the telescope lid is opened again). you also get' b'to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is' b'done and hst is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for' b'the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from' b'thrusters and the like).' b'' b'the original plan was to use the orbital maneuvering vehicle to do the' b'reboost. the omv was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well' b'suited to precisely this sort of job. unfortunately, it was costing' b'a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was' b'relatively short, so it got cancelled.' b'--'
