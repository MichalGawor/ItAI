b'' b'the xview version source distribution included in the contrib section' b"of x11r5 included the source to the textedit program. i'd like to take" b'the sources and modify them to add support for a tooltalk-like message' b"server, and maybe for tooltalk while i'm at it, since the sun-supplied" b"textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk." b'' b'however, the sources in the r5 contrib area seem to be for an older' b'version of textedit than the version shipped with openwindows for' b'example, the own textedit includes drag and drop support and a' b'dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview' b'knows nothing about drag and drop.' b'' b"the textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version b"dated while doing a 'what textedit' on the own binary says:" b'' b'textedit.c copyr sun micro' b'dragdrop.c copyr sun micro' b'tooltalk.c copyr sun micro' b'ds_relname.c copyr sun micro' b'' b'so, does anyone know if the sources to textedit are available?' b"i'd really like to work from the latest source if possible." b'' b"please reply by email, and i'll post a summary if there's enough" b'interest.' b'--' b'matt landau\t\t\twaiting for a flash of enlightenment'
