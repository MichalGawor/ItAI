b'' b'i have had a zeos for a couple months. while the experience was not' b'painless or perfect, it was way better than that endured by most b'people i personally know) who have ordered gateways. (of course,' b'several of the gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as' b"gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent" b'out...b{)' b'' b'i got the mb viper card. the first one was defective, but zeos' b"replaced it with only minor hassles. this one works fine. i haven't" b'noticed any problems in any of my applications. i also ordered it' b'because of all the complaints about the ati a few months ago. guess' b'you can choose either buggy state-of-the-art stuff, or robust average' b'stuff....' b'' b'for my particular configuration (tower, watt supply, pkg#3, no' b'monitor, viper, etc.) the zeos was slightly cheaper than gateway,' b'austin, etc. but this can change from month to month.' b'' b'mike'
