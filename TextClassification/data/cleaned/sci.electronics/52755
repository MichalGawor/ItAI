b'' b'' b"yes, i know it's nowhere near christmas time, but i'm gonna loose" b"net access in a few days (maybe a week or if i'm lucky), and wanted" b"to post this for interested people to save 'till xmas. b'note: bell labs is a good place if you have a phd and a good boss, i' b'have neither.' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'' b'another version of a variable brightness xmas light set:' b'this set starts with a blinker bulb string.' b'' b'diagram: orginal way set' b'' b'120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!' b'!---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!' b'!' b'120rtn_____________________!' b'' b'modified set for level brightness:' b'' b'string b'120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!' b'\\_10k_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!' b'5w string b'b b'120v rtn__!___!' b'' b'^ note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.' b'' b'only one blinker is used.' b'' b'note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the' b'string bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in' b"parallel with it. that's why the use of the 10k 5w resistor" b'here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the' b'current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing' b'and the second string is not glowing. when the blinker goes open,' b'this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the' b'strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.' b'or use a 3w 120v bulb in place of the 10k resistor if you can get' b'one. caution, do not replace with a standard c9 bulb, as these' b'draw too much current and burn out the blinker. c9 approx 7w.' b'' b"what you'll see when it's working: powerup, string will light" b'at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current' b'from the second string, making them not light. b will open, placing' b'both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a' b'low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow' b'at reduced brightness.' b'' b'be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires' b'in a safe manner!'
