b'' b'my response to the "shooting down" of a turkish airplane over the armenian' b'air space was because of the ignorant posting of the person from your' b'country. turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the' b'karabakh conflict with azerbaijan. the karabakhi-armenians who have lived' b'in their homeland for years (cut off from armenia and given to azeris' b'by stalin) are the ones directly involved in the conflict. they are defending' b'themselves against azeri aggression. agression that has no mercy for inocent' b"people that are costantly shelled with mig-23's and othe russian aircraft." b'' b'at last, i hope that the u.s. insists that turkey stay out of the karabakh' b'crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never occur again.' b'' b'' b'armenia is involved in fighting with azarbaijan. it is armenian' b'soldiers from mainland armenia that are shelling towns in azarbaijan.' b'you might wish to read more about whether or not it is azeri aggression' b'only in that region. it seems to me that the armenians are better' b'organized, have more success militarily and shell azeri towns' b'repeatedly.' b'' b"i don't wish to get into the cyprus discussion. turkey had the right to" b'intervene, and it did. perhaps the intervention was not supposed to' b'last for so long, but the constant refusal of the greek governments both' b'on the island and in greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed' b'for the ongoing standoff in the region.' b'' b'lastly, why is there not a soc.culture.armenia? i vote yes for it.' b'after all, it is now free.' b'' b'regards,' b'deniz' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
