b'' b'' b'you might visit some congregations of christians, who happen to be homosexuals,' b'that are spirit-filled believers,' b'' b'gifts of the spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior.' b'a lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs. jesus said' b'that people would come to him saying "lord, lord," and proclaiming' b'the miraculous works they had done in his name. jesus would tell' b'them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know him, and to' b'depart from him.' b'' b'that is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual' b'sin. if the holy spirit were only given to the morally perfect, he would' b'not be given to me, or any of us. god can forgive any sin, if we repent.' b'but people should be careful not to think, "god has given me a gift of' b'the spirit, it must be okay to be gay." that is dangerous (see also hebrews' b'6 about those who have partaken of the holy spirit and of the powers of' b'the world to come.)' b'' b"the lord is working in our community (the homosexual community, that is). he's" b'not asking us to change our sexual nature,' b'' b"jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature. we cannot lift ourselves" b'out of our own sin- but we must submit to his hand as he changes our' b'nature. practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the' b'morality that god has set forth.' b'' b"if you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant," b"then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's." b'is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the' b'homosexual\'s or the one considered "ignorant?"' b'' b'link hudson.'
