b'' b'' b' isn\'t it funny that a white person calls comeone a "nigger" and gets banned' b' for a year, but a black person calls someone a "faggot" and there is no' b' consequence?' b'' b' ted' b'' b'' b"ted, you're missing a vital point. as roger lustig pointed out in a" b'previous response, the reason why schott was banned from baseball was' b'because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on' b'a constant basis. such thoughts affected her hiring practices. bonilla,' b'on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.' b'if he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a' b"different story. furthermore, he is merely an athlete. he doesn't have to" b'hire anyone as schott had to do. dave pallone, the former nl umpire who is' b'an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a mets' b'game at shea. he, like you, thinks that bonilla should be suspended from' b"baseball. pallone is hoping for a year's suspension. in my opinion," b"that's downright ludicrous. as howie rose on wfan said, if you start" b'suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time' b"under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining" b'to play a three-on-three game. now, honestly, if you truly analyze the' b'differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, i' b"would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts." b'' b'' b'-sean' b'' b'' b'' b'*******************************************************************************' b'"behind the bag!"' b'- vin scully' b'*******************************************************************************'
