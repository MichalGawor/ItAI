b'' b' actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talking' b'the other day about putting just one detector on one of the pluto satellites.' b'then we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like b'pounds of eq. well, a batse detector needs lead shielding to protect it,' b'and alone weighs about pounds itself.' b'' b'actually, the situation is even worse than that. the *total mass* of the' b'pluto fast flyby spacecraft is only 250ish pounds, and most of that is' b'support equipment like power and communications. the mass available for' b"instruments is maybe of that. i don't think a batse will fit..." b'' b"actually, would you need the shielding? my understanding is that it's" b'mostly there to give the detectors some directionality. no point in' b"doing that if you've only got one. i'm sure the burst detectors that" b"have flown on other deep-space missions haven't weighed that much." b"(mind you, they're probably still too heavy the pff people would put" b'more pluto-specific instruments on first, if they had any mass to spare.)' b'--'
