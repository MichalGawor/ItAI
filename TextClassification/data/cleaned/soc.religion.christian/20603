b'' b'' b" i don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of" b' christianity through argument. we have to help foster faith and an' b' understanding of god. i could be wrong--are there any former atheists here' b' who were led to christianity by argument?' b'' b"this is an excellent question and i'll be anxious to see if there are" b'any such cases. i doubt it. in the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent.' b'when aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone' b'"knew the rules." today, when you can\'t count on people knowing even' b'the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is' b'often indistinguishable from a poor one.' b'' b'sorry; just one of my perennial gripes...<:-' b'' b'ken' b'--' b'opinions are my own g. k. chesterton'
