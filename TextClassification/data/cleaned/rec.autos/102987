b'' b'' b"i have a chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. it's odometer turned 90k" b'and the sensor light started blinking. i went to the dealer and he said' b'it was a maintenance light saying i need to change the oxygen sensor. he' b'said, it is to be changed every 30k, but since i bought the car when it' b"had 77k, i don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k. he" b'quoted for the part and to install it. the part cost b'outside, but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor' b'is placed too deep in the engine parts. he suggested i wait till it' b'malfunctions before i do anything. if anyone out there owns a chevy' b'sprint, i want to know how they got their oxygen sensors changed. also,' b"did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. also," b'what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction.' b' any help would be greatly apprecisted' b' thanks' b'' b'' b'' b'' b"i sold my sprint last april with 95k on it. i'd driven it since" b'the previous july, putting 20k miles on it. the sensor light used to' b'light up regularly, starting about 5k miles after i bought it.' b'my brother and i rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment,' b'so i suppose the sensor could have used replacement. performance (hah,' b'if you could call it that) did not change. perhaps emissions increased,' b'but how much emissions could a ca-registered cylinder engine produce?' b'that was a neat car, i held the engine block easily in one hand! has' b"anyone ever driven the 'turbo' variant? just curious..." b'' b'adam edwards' b'' b''
