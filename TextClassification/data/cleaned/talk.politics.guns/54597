b'' b'' b"i'd appreciate any help anyone could give me on these two questions:" b'' b'the brady bill was in the news throughout but what actually happened to' b'it in congress? did bush veto it? if so, when?' b'' b' the brady bill passed the house in but failed to reach a' b"vote in the senate. as such, it never reached bush. (sarah brady's" b'condemnation not-withstanding).' b'' b'i have a joint house-senate conference committe report (i.e., crime bill)' b'for the 102rd congress which contains a "brady bill day waiting period"' b'within it. i believe it just died and never came up for a vote in either' b'house.' b'' b" it'll probably pass the house again, and will probably pass the" b"senate if they can get it to a vote. whether of not they'll be busy" b'with other things will be the question.' b'' b"they got four years of clinton's support to pass it." b'--'
