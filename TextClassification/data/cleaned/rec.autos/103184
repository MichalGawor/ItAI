b'' b'i too was puzzled by this obvious untruth. what i think is going on is that' b'nissan claims that the altima is "the best selling new car namelplate in' b'the us" (i think i have this near verbatim). lee iaccoca\'s statistics' b'dept. would have been proud of that sentence.' b'' b'note that the corolla/prism are also new designs... but hey are not new' b'"nameplates." i guess nissan doesn\'t even sell as many altimas as' b'toyota does corollas, or there would be no "nameplate" qualifier.' b'' b"but waiiiiiit, isn't nissan officially registering the car as far as" b'government paperwork goes, nissan stanza altima, to avoid costly and' b'lengthy paperwork? i read this on the net a while ago, and someone' b"actually may have said there's a little stanza logo on the altima" b'somewhere.' b'' b'you *can* have it both ways b'' b'spiros' b'--' b'software technology, delco electronics b'gm hughes electronics, kokomo, in "i post, therefore i armm"'
