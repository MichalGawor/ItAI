b'' b'' b"wait a second, you're ignoring major facts here." b'' b'there was no attempt to simply serve a warrant. the batf had a' b'no-knock warrant. the initial firefight began when the batf threw' b'concussion grenades at the building. (batf admits this!)' b'' b"\twhen did the batf say this? everything i've seen from the batf," b'\tfrom the official version to the dissident statements of batf' b'\tofficers who conducted the raid claims that the davidians were' b'\tshooting at the agents long before they were within grenade' b'\trange.' b'' b'what i saw on tv and what you claim are two different things. the' b'davidians did not start shooting until after the batf lobbed a couple' b'genades in the windows and started shooting themselves.' b'' b"\talso, if the warrant is sealed, how do we know it was a 'no-knock'?" b'' b'easy! if you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns' b'going in throught windows, that is a no-knock warrant. also since the' b"videotape shows the batf throwing grenades before the bd's etunred fire," b"you can safely assume that they didn't ring the doorbell." b'' b'' b'p.vasilion,' b'' b'p.s. get rid of that bandwidth clogging .sig!'
