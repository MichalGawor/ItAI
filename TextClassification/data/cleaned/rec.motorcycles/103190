b'' b'' b'' b'as summer approaches, the usual preparations are being made...' b'' b'me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the local' b'state forests. for that i was planning to get a backpack/rucksack.' b'the next question is how shall i carry the thing on the bike, given' b'the metal frame and all. i have a big backrest (approx high) and' b'was hoping that i would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.' b'' b'any one have any experiences on such experimentation?' b'' b'taking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully' b'loaded with a full load (40lbs). is the load distribution going to' b'be very severly affected? how will the bike perform with such a load' b'clinging to the back rest. if i really secure it, with no shifting,' b'do i still increase my chances of surfing?' b'' b'' b'collective r.m. wisdom requested.' b'' b'' b"p.s. i really can't afford leather pants. boots and jeans are" b'all i can make do with. what you think of the knee protectors' b'which rollerbladers use the one l.l.bean and like sells. is' b'that a bad idea (tm). are there any equivalents?' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b"'81 cb650 \t\t\t\t\t\tdod b'' b'i would give my right arm to be ambidextrous!'
