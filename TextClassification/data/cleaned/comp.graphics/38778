you want to know more.' b'' b'' b'' b'9) converting between vector formats.' b'' b'a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript, or macdraw' b'to cgm, or whatever. it is important to understand that this is a very' b'different problem from the image format conversions in item converting' b'one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you' b'get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel the basic objects' b'are the same for all image formats. this is not so for vector formats.' b'the basic objects circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled' b'round-cornered rectangles, etc. vary from one format to another.' b'except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do' b'a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.' b'' b'there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp.psc.edu. the' b'contributor states that it runs on unix, ms-windows, and possibly the mac.' b'a better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.' b'' b'on the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,' b'rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.' b'as far as i know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such' b'converters, but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been' b'posted to comp.sources.misc. check the index on your nearest archive' b'site.' b'' b'a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format' b'to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format, or hpgl to' b'x11 bitmap. for example, some of the commercial postscript clones for' b"pc's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer. also," b"the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun's x11/news can" b"be used to render to a file if you're clever. but in general, the" b'answer is no. however, if someone were to put together a vector to' b'vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be' b'trivial.' b'' b'gnu ghostscript (from the fsf current version includes' b'drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as' b'a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter.

b'11) how do i draw a circle as a bezier (or b-spline) curve?' b'' b'the short answer is, "you can\'t." unless you use a rational spline you' b'can only approximate a circle. the approximation may look acceptable,' b'but it is sensitive to scale. magnify the scale and the error of' b'approximation magnifies. deviations from circularity that were not' b'visible in the small can become glaring in

point is within a planar polygon.' b'' b'consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to' b'infinity. if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,' b'the point is within the polygon. if the ray crosses an even number of' b'edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior' b'hole formed from intersecting polygon edges. this idea is known in' b"the trade as the jordan curve theorem; see eric haines' article in" b"glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including" b'treatment of special cases.' b'' b'another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all' b'the vertices on the polygon. if the sum is pi, the point is inside,' b'if the sum is the point is outside. however, this method is about an' b'order of
