b'' b'well, i gotta tell ya,' b'' b"last night's leafs game vs the devils was a nail-bitter let me tell you!" b'it was a well played game by both teams (i thought) but according to the' b'don and ron it was the an "off-night" for the leafs and the devils' b'were outplaying toronto. well, i beg to differ....' b'' b'imho, clark deserved to be a first star as much as gilmour did. his' b'fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he' b'created reminded me of the clark of old. (but not to take any of the' b'credit away from gilmour).' b'' b'i think the leafs are playing great hockey. why?' b'well first look at their injury list which includes, cullen, ellet,' b'zezel, macoun. of course my question is this....how will the leafs' b'fare when they are once again "healthy" if they are playing this well' b'so far??' b'' b'second, just look at their standings, still second in defence,' b"moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost" b'at home in last games, game undefeated streak..etc.' b"(btw, am i wrong or was this potvin's first shut-out? i can't" b'remember him having any as of yet.)' b'' b'well, as of april we see that the race for first in the norris' b'has truly begun and it will be a very close race between chicago and' b'toronto. and the best game of the season will probably be their last' b'against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to' b'see this one?)' b'' b"coming to the stretch and still a roar'in!!!!!" b'go leafs go!!!!' b'--' b'******************************************' b'* alfred (yong-jeh) yim toronto wins the' b'* 4b mathematics (actuarial science) cup.' b'* university of waterloo, canada. i like "coca-cola" idea personally' b'*****************************************************************************'
