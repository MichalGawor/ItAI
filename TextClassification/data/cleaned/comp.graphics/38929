b'' b'i am looking for a shareware graphics package called neopaint v1.1. i' b'saw it in a shareware catalog and was hoping that i could ftp it from' b'the net but have been unable to locate it. i have tried archie and i' b'have gone through the entire comp.graphics newsgroup looking for some' b'reference to it and have found none. i have also looked through the' b'faq and also no reference. the program is called neopaint v1.1 and if' b'anyone has heard of it or knows where i can get it i would appreciate' b'it.' b'' b'suggestions for other pc based shareware paint programs would also be' b'appreciated. email me your responses.' b'' b'much thanks,' b'sean'
