b'' b'a local dealer is offering mac ii vi machines equipped with kodak multi-' b'session compatible cd-rom drives for what seems like an attractive price:' b"$1500. i've used many other models up to a ii ci, but this would be the" b'first i could have my own mac. is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued' b"model such as this. i'd like to yank the cd-rom drive out, put it in a" b'housing and share it with my pc. is this feasible? the only info i have on' b'the ii vi is that it is relatively slow (16mhz), has an chip with a' b'math coprocessor. i want to add a non-apple portrait monitor and use this' b'machine for hypercard stack design. is this a good buy, or would i be' b'wasting my money? i would appreciate some advice. thanks!' b'' b'robert matthews' b'' b'(taiwan)'
