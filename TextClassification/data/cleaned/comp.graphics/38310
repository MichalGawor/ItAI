b'' b'hi steve,' b'' b'as the author of multiverse, i feel i had better respond to your' b'mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this' b'software the quick answer is yes! the long answer is yes but a' b"few have had a few problems with their platforms not all unix's are" b'the same, you know! as far as "many bugs" go, it would probably be more' b'useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! b'' b'platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: rs6000, dec ultrix' b'sun solaris so it is possible.' b'' b"the main problem is that i don't have access to other platforms than the" b'rs6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear' b'about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to' b'how to fix it.' b'' b'as far as the software not doing anything, do you really think i would' b"bother releasing it, if that was the case? perhaps you didn't read the" b'few docs that are supplied. the dogfight world is made up of clients' b"only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see" b"anything! the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary so if you don't" b'see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!' b'' b"one final word if you're not interested, don't bother with it." b"if you are interested, then please remember that i'm not asking for" b'any money! so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism,' b'maybe that will get results??' b'' b'robert.' b''
