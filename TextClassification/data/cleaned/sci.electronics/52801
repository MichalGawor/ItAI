b'' b'' b"| i might add that collecting last year's data books (or even ones two years out" b"| of date) is usually pretty cheap, and has benefits besides: you usually don't" b'| want to base a design on a brand-new chip. there may be bugs; availability may' b'| be limited; the data sheets may be missing critical information that will show' b"| up in the ap notes in next year's data books. kinda like buying version of" b"| a major new software package: sometimes you get lucky, but don't count on it." b'' b'there are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two' b'years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.' b'' b'when a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the' b'national mm-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc.,' b'it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced' b'for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). now, if you' b'have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead' b"gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know" b'the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.' b'' b'the old ge thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on' b'scr and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for' b'example.' b'' b"| in summary, read. read! ****read!!!**** that's how you'll know what to" b'| design in, which parts to use, and how to solve the intractable problem' b'| that your boss has presented you with.' b'|' b'| it helps to have a prodigous memory for details...' b'' b'here, here!...' b'' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------' b'dave medin\t\t\tphone:\t(205) (w)' b'ssd--networking\t\t\t\t(205) (h)' b'intergraph corp.' b'huntsville, al 35894\t\tuucp: ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin' b'' b'******* everywhere you look (at least around my office) b'' b'* the opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)'
