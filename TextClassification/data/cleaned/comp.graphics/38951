b'' b'' b'i use arts letters on a pc and if you make use of the tracing preferences' b"it traces beautifully. but there's a trick to tracing. i've traced entire" b"cartoon images into custom clip art, but you can't expect to just point to" b'the image and get it just like that, it takes a little work (in some cases' b'a lot of work). you need to trace a drawing piece by piece, and then put it' b"together... it's kinda hard to explain in type, but if you're ever in reno" b'i can give you a little demonstration!'
