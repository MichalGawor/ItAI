b'' b"i have a chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. it's odometer turned 90k" b'and the sensor light started blinking. i went to the dealer and he said' b'it was a maintenance light saying i need to change the oxygen sensor. he' b'said, it is to be changed every 30k, but since i bought the car when it' b"had 77k, i don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k. he" b'quoted for the part and to install it. the part cost b'outside, but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor' b'is placed too deep in the engine parts. he suggested i wait till it' b'malfunctions before i do anything. if anyone out there owns a chevy' b'sprint, i want to know how they got their oxygen sensors changed. also,' b"did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. also," b'what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction.' b' any help would be greatly apprecisted' b' thanks' b'' b' nagesh' b'i have owned my sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every' b"30k to let you know it's time for a check up. when that light goes on, i just" b'take it to the delaer tell them "it\'s that time" and they work on it for hou' b'and you pay for parts and for labor. (ahh...what they get for labor)' b'i currently have about 95k on my sprint and of all the times i took it in for' b'service, i never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the' b'oxygen sensor. what the heck is an oxygen sensor? as far an i know of, i have' b'never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.' b"now, i don't have a/c (mother nature does that for me and that might have" b'something to do with it, but i still never heard of an oxygen sensor. the only' b'major service job i have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced' b'if you want to call that a service job) was getting the rotor, distributor and' b'gasket replaced. and that was all done within the past months.' b'' b'what i do at 30k is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need' b"to, pay the bill (about and go home and don't worry about the car for" b'another 30k. oh, i just remembered something. if that little sensor light' b'bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against' b'the dash, there is a swith on the right side. flip that switch and the light' b"will go off. i do that so that little light won't annoy me. if you can't" b'find it, look it up in the car manuel. i hope that i have helped a little' b'and good luck with the _oxygen sensor_?' b'' b'- thomas b'' b'******************************************************************************' b'* e-mail address: \t\t "give me an an army of west point, b'*\t\t\t\t give me a handful of texas aggies, b'* "creator of mot power!"\t and i\'ll win a war." b'*\t\t\t\t *\t gen. george s. patton b'******************************************************************************' b'' b''
