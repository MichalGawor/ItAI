b'' b'' b'hey, now will you stop encouraging him? copy protection only serves one pur-' b'pose: to keep the honest buyer from making (legal) backup copies. it will' b'definitely not stop any pirates. if you want to protect you soft, supply a' b'good documentation and support. this is imho the *only* way of effectively pro' b'tecting software.' b'best regards,' b'arno' b'' b"i strongly disagree. i think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't" b'copy the program if "diskcopy" can\'t do it.' b"if you're talking a max goal of pirated copies, i bet that anything that" b"will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will" b'suffice.' b'i hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online *not*' b'because i want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and' b"and convenient than sifting through an old book i can't find." b'' b'off deeper end- why does everyone think they need to be able to make a' b'backup copy? almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,' b'so you are left with the originals as your backups. i think its a waste' b'of time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to "lend"' b'out the backups.' b'' b'' b'no flames intended just my thoughts.' b'' b'eric'
