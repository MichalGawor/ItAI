b'' b'' b' i was just wondering one thing, actually two. i hope that this is the' b'proper place to post this subject)' b'' b' why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)' b'when stored on a concrete floor?' b' i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle' b'from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and i just' b'went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but' b'they act like the two terminals are shorted. i asked a friend' b"and he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them," b"but he couldn't tell me why." b'' b'thanks' b'' b'i am not a battery expert, but from recent reading, a lead acid battery' b'will self discharge at a relatively high rate, and if stored in a discharged' b'state, will develop a condition i think is called sulfation. in storage,' b'either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance' b"i'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a trickle" b'charge. i have also (i think) read that the condition may be reversable' b'if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a long period of time.' b'the refernce i remember is to use c/50 (where c is the amp hours) as the' b'charging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks. some of this may' b'only apply to gel type cells, but i suspect the same applies to the liquid' b'type.' b'' b'richard dell' b''
