b'' b'' b'--' b'' b'i would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an' b'ir emitting source at a distance of about meters (more is better) in' b"daylight. the ir source could be emitting a signature; i'm leaning toward" b'30 khz square wave with duty cycle.' b'' b'i am considering the use of a quadrant detector from centronic inc. to give' b'information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the' b'angles. for the source i am considering wazing the heck out of an ir led(s),' b'possibly an optek op290 or motorola mled81. wazing would mean at least amp' b'current pulses. at this current the duty cycle of the led drops to and i' b'would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the required.' b'' b'has anyone done something like this?' b'' b'(403) dre suffield, box medicine hat, ab, canada, t1a 8k6'
