b'' b'writes:' b'writes:' b'' b'ielding rf of all time, as far' b' \t as anyone can tell' b'' b' i did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak' b'comparable' b' to or better than winfield. in my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement,' b'you' b' could make good cases for ruth, aaron, ott, robinson, clemente, kaline,' b' maris, klein, jackson, waner, and probably a few others. this is not a' b' knock on winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other' b' players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while winfield' b'has' b' been more uniformly excellent. hall of fame? absolutely. top-10 peak?' b" i'm not so sure. top total career value? yes, almost certainly." b'' b"point taken. when was winfield's peak years anyway? probably around b'' b"that's the trouble: *what* peak years? he wavers between excellent and" b'very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there. was a fine' b'year; and were merely really good. with the yankees, (i think)' b'was the best; that was the one with the ba.' b'' b"of course, wasn't bad, either. he's been in the bigs since b"with a one-year intermission for surgery. though he doesn't have the" b"mix of skills that pete rose did, he's like pete rose in one way: he's" b"not a natural hitter. winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing" b'in new york, and that includes the gulf+western building. but his sheer' b'athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.' b'' b'fascinating player to watch, even now. not obviously great in any one' b'way; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising' b'levels.' b'' b'roger' b''
