"when people are on' b'the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over' b'the edge."' b'the seattle study correlated months of asthma emergency room visits' b'with daily levels of pm,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter' b'of microns or less. these finer particles are considered hazardous because' b'they are small enough penetrate into the lung. cities are considered out of' b'compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of pm10' b'exceeds micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.' b'in seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at' b'levels as low as micrograms. the authors concluded that for every b'microgram increase in the four-day average of pm10, the odds of someone with' b'asthma needing emergency treatment increased by percent.' b'the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory' b'disease, an official journal of the american thoracic society, the lung' b"association's medical section." b'the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that' b'particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat. a study' b'by dr. schwartz and douglas dockery, ph.d., of harvard found that particles' b'may be causing roughly premature deaths each year in the united states.' b'other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms' b'and bronchitis in children.' b'"government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,"' b'says dr. schwartz. "but more and more research is showing that particles are' b'bad actors as well." one problem in setting, standards for particulate' b'air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study. unlike other regulated' b'pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex' b'and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and' b'' b'hicnet medical newsletter page b'volume number april b'' b'acid aerosols.' b'"researchers can\'t put people in exposure chambers to study the effects' b'of particulate air pollution," says dr. schwartz. "we have no way of' b'duplicating the typical urban mix of particles. consequently, most of what' b'is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research' b'like the seattle study.' b"given that the epa's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur" b'dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm10 standard any' b'time soon. until changes are made, there appears to be little people with' b'asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.' b'"in some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only' b"cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's" b'rarely particulate matter," says dr. schwartz. "however, pm10 doesn\'t have' b'to be near its violation range to be unhealthy."' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''

percent of patients after surgical' b'excision with a centimeter margin; elective lymph node dissections and' b'extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; b'patients with

b'nci-designated cancer centers' b'' b'the cancer centers program is comprised of nci-designated cancer centers' b'actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer' b'incidence, morbidity, and mortality. within the program, there are four types' b'of cancer centers: basic science cancer centers which engage primarily' b'in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers which focus on' b'clinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers which emphasize a' b'multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community' b'outreach; and consortium cancer centers which specialize in cancer' b'prevention and control research.' b'' b'although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was' b'the national cancer act of that authorized the establishment of new' b'cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones. the passage' b"of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened" b'the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and' b"cancer control research. over the next two decades, the centers' program grew" b'progressively.' b'' b'in there were comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. today,' b'there are of these institutions, all of which meet specific nci criteria' b'for comprehensive status.' b'' b'to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center, an' b'institution must pass rigorous peer review. under guidelines newly' b'established in the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include the' b'requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in' b'several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong' b'program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings' b'into clinical practice.' b'' b'moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly' b'beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant (also' b'referred to as a p30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting' b"the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations. these criteria encompass" b'strong participation in nci-designated high-priority clinical trials,' b'significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important' b'outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of' b'sources.' b'' b'the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and' b'capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit' b'important new findings or address timely research questions.' b'' b'' b'hicnet medical newsletter page b'volume number april b'' b'of the nci-designated cancer centers, are of the basic science type.' b'these centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers' b'engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators' b'and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications' b'from new discoveries in the laboratory.' b'' b'clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and' b'clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently' b'incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their' b'overall research programs. there are such centers today.' b'' b'finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely' b'structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and' b'control research. these centers interface with state and local public health' b'departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention' b'and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions' b'responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.' b'consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with' b'institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community' b'hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.' b'' b'together, the nci-designated cancer centers continue to work toward' b'creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through' b'interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the' b'laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.' b'' b'comprehensive cancer centers (internet addresses are given

by microgenesys inc. and the national institutes of' b'health, which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested. health and' b'human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement on the' b'therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last friday. companies' b'including genentech inc., chiron corp., and immuno ag have already told nih' b'that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests. the testing is' b'intended to demonstrate whether aids vaccines are effective in thwarting the' b"replication of hiv in patients already infected. shalala refuted

and i expect there to be some announcement in the' b'next hours about that particular aids research project," said shalala.' b'administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr. bernadine' b'healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had' b'convinced the white house that multiple vaccines should be tested' b'simultaneously. but microgenesys president
