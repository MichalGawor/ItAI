b'' b'; i am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle, and to' b';put it bluntly, it sucks. i really would like some advice on what would' b';be a good starter bike for me. i do know one thing however, i need to' b';make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is' b';out of the question. i am specifically interested in racing bikes, (cbr' b';600 f2, gsx-r i know that this may sound kind of crazy' b";considering that i've never had a bike before, but i am responsible, a" b';fast learner, and in love.' b'' b"responsible and in love? i believe that's a contradiction" b'in terms.' b'' b'unless you\'re really brave (read: "reckless") a 500cc sport' b'bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first' b'year of riding. getting more than that really is overkill,' b"as you'll never even want to use it. the following bikes" b'can be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice' b'to manage, and are plenty high performance:' b'kawasaki ex-500' b'honda vf-500 "interceptor"' b'suzuki gs-550e' b'' b'the 0-100mph time of the ex-500 at full throttle is "way' b'sooner than you\'re ready for it". with something' b"as small as a you'd probably be wishing for more" b"power pretty quickly (unless it's a tzr or rgv b'' b"now, i'm not saying that you're certain to kill" b'yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a gsxr-750. plenty' b'of people have started riding on those bikes and done' b"just fine. what i am saying is that it's a waste of" b'money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you' b'drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.' b"you'll never get the throttle more than half open" b'anyway, so why spend the extra bucks?' b'' b'---' b'chris'
