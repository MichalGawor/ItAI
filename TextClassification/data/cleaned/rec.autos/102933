b'' b'i too was puzzled by this obvious untruth. what i think is going on is that' b'nissan claims that the altima is "the best selling new car namelplate in' b'the us" (i think i have this near verbatim). lee iaccoca\'s statistics' b'dept. would have been proud of that sentence.' b'' b'' b'note that the corolla/prism are also new designs... but hey are not new' b'"nameplates." i guess nissan doesn\'t even sell as many altimas as' b'toyota does corollas, or there would be no "nameplate" qualifier.'
