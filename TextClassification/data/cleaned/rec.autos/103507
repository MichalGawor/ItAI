b'' b'' b'my wife and i looked at, and drove one last fall. this was a model.' b'it was wayyyyyyyyy underpowered. i could not imagine driving it in the' b'mountains here in colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. i' b'have read that the new models have a newer, improved hp engine.' b'' b'i\'m quite serious that i laughed in the salesman face when he said "once' b'it\'s broken in it will feel more powerful". i had been used to driving a' b"jeep 4.0l 190hp engine. i believe the 92's land cruisers (land yachts)" b'were 3.0l, the sames as the 4runner, which is also underpowered (in my' b'own personal opinion).' b'' b'they are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.' b'' b'' b'( b' hewlett packard co. phone: b' b' i love animals. they taste delicious. b'(_____)-----------------------------------------------------------(_____)' b'' b'the land cruiser has a l6 engine which has hp and torgue, when i' b'drove it here in california, power is more than enough. the high price is' b'the only reason i did not buy it.'
