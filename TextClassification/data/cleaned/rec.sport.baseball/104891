b'' b'' b'during spring training i made a similarly innoncent-looking comment' b'about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying. "no such' b'thing as clutch hitting" they (the sdcn\'s) all screamed. i assumed' b'they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance,' b"given their comments. i'm still licking the wounds, but i do have" b'a rebuttal planned. (gotta do my homework, as they say)' b'' b'[some deletions]' b' rather they showed, quite convincingly, that' b'\tpast clutch performance has never been able to predict future' b'\tclutch performance.' b'' b"i'm sure *you* are convinced, dave. apparently so is tony perez." b'i, however, am not.' b'' b'' b'i believe at the time of the sabo plate appearance that juan samuel' b'was on the bench available for pinch-hit duty. over the past four' b'seasons:' b'' b'\t\tnon-clutch\t\t\tclutch' b'\t\tab\th\tba\t\tab\th\tba' b'' b'sabo\t\t1539\t452\t.294\t\t259\t59\t.228' b'samuel\t\t1564\t383\t.245\t\t278\t83\t.299' b'' b'i do *not* claim that this is a complete statistical analysis that' b'proves the existence of clutch hitting, or compelling testimony that' b"samuel would have gotten a base hit. i'm sure there is something wrong" b'with the sample size, or that the basic assumption that clutch' b'performance is random invalidates any conclusions from this limited' b"application. or something or other. i don't pretend to understand" b'statistical analysis.' b'' b'' b'well, we agree on the last part.:-) one of the basic things you need to' b"have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it" b'in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year. a' b"player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year." b"a player's ability to walk or infielder's defensive average are correlated" b'better. that is to say, given their past performance in those statistics' b"we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year. put in" b'some simple information about aging and you can do even better. one of' b'the basic problems with something like "clutch" batting average overall' b'batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero.' b"adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much. as a counterexample to" b'what you showed, consider the following two players from b'' b'non-clutch clutch' b'ab h ba ab h ba' b'' b'maldonado b'lemon b'' b'if you had had these two players in by your logic, in those "clutch"' b"situations, you'd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye. well, in" b'1988, maldonado hit in "non-clutch" and in "clutch", while lemon' b'hit in "non-clutch" and in "clutch". before you accuse me of' b'completely cooking the data, there were players who had "clutch"' b'at bats every year from (according to elias). as a simple' b"measure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch ba-non-clutch ba. if you use" b"'84-'87 to predict for those players, you'd find that of the" b"96 were below league average in that measure both in and in b'26 were above league average in both periods and the other were' b'above in one and below in the other. if you were just flipping coins,' b"you'd expect to get above/below in both and that switched. the" b'difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment' b'is not statisically significant.' b'' b"btw, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from with" b"'88 gives a correlation coefficient of which is significant at" b'something better than the confidence level. correlating their' b'(clutch-non-clutch ba) for the same period gives a correlation of' b'0.088, significant at no level of any interest.' b'' b'' b'' b' everyone would agree (i hope) that a grand' b'\tslam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three' b'\tis a very clutch hit. there is just no way to predict who is more' b'\tlikely to get the clutch hit based on past performance (hitting in' b'\t"clutch" situations).' b'' b'' b'if you say so, dave. no way.' b'' b'' b"actually, it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future" b"clutch performance. it's more correct to say that we can't predict" b'future clutch performance with any skill.' b'' b'harold' b'--' b'national severe storms laboratory (norman, ok)' b'"i used to work for a brewery, too, but i didn\'t drink on the job."' b"-p. bavasi on dal maxvill's view that florida can win the nl east in
