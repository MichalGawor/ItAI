b'' b"i've got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints" b'i have about the clipper chip. pass a law stating that if, within a' b"year of performaing a wiretap on someone, a police agency hasn't" b'managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for,' b'then that agency owes the suspect million to repay him/her for' b'lost privacy.' b'of course, there are *still* problems with the technical aspects of' b'clipper, and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind' b'an attempt to enforce it as a standard. but this would be a way for' b'those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will' b'only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are' b'all but certain that there really will be a conviction....' b'' b'--john kj' b'elsey'
