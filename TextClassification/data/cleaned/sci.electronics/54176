b'' b'can someone tell me where to find 120volt watt ma fans that' b'fit the standard computer mounting size )ie. and inch wide' b'and inches diagonal from hole to hole (hole=where bolt or screw' b'goes through. i have found higher (noisy) fans that are v' b'6 watt, but i need a quite fan. i can use volt as well, but' b'found just about all volt fans to be noisy. i also find that' b'the v fans are not only quieter, but the blade shape has a lot' b"to do with it. i have a dead fan that was quiet in it's day. it" b'has long blades (like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is' b'the only way i can describe it. the dead fan is etri model 126lh.' b"actually it's not dead, it just makes a hideous rattle noise so" b"it's stealthy qualities are void. thanks." b'' b''
