b'' b'' b' can you, while my mind is on it, give us one good reason that the' b' algorithm should be a secret algorithm, unless this encryption scheme' b" either is a joke, or contains features like a 'master key' or other back" b' door for unauthorized eavesdropping?' b'' b'hmm, here are a couple:' b'' b'1) if the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce' b'pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and' b"privacy, because their keys are only in their users' hands." b'' b'2) since skipjack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to' b'agree on a session key. the released information says that any' b'protocol may be used (e.g., dh). from a theoretical point of view,' b'this is probably true. however, from a practical point of view, those' b'chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. what if' b'it is good old rsa? this will mean that the producer will have to pay' b'lots of bucks to pkp. by keeping the details secret this can be' b'avoided...' b'' b'regards,' b'vesselin' b'--' b'vesselin vladimirov bontchev virus test center, university of hamburg' b'tel.:+49-40-54715-224, fax: fachbereich informatik agn' b'< pgp public key available on request. vogt-koelln-strasse rm. c'
