b'' b'i have a question for you all related to this. jesus condemns divorce' b'several times in the new testament, and i have a hard time with this.' b'the catholic church (as far as i can tell) does grant annulments with' b"the statement that the marriage never really existed in god's eyes." b'(please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.) however, i have' b'witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but' b'recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by' b'staying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal' b'childhood issues that had never been resolved. i ask you, is divorce' b'justified in such a case? they knew who they were, what they were' b'doing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out.' b"i must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together, or" b'even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else' b'later on. opinions?' b'' b'vera' b'*******************************************************************************' b'i am your clock! i bind unto myself today vera noyes' b'i own you!\t trinity....\t\t no disclaimer what' b"- lard\t |\t- st. patrick's breastplate is there to disclaim?" b'*******************************************************************************' b'' b"[this is a commonly discussed question, though it's been long enough" b"that i'll allow it to be asked. as you might expect, there is a range" b'of answers. catholics and some others will say that divorce is never' b'justified. (by the way, in situations where someone is being abused,' b'or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions' b'that i know. no one should be forced to stay in a situation where' b'they are in danger.) others see it as a last resort in situations' b'that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is' b'to choose the lesser of evils. in some sense the difficult legal' b"question turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage. that's because" b"of jesus' statement in mark and par. as with so many other" b'things, this turns on your approach to the bible. conservative' b'protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions.' b'more liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where' b'a literal interpretation would lead to painful results. (it is noted' b'that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost' b'on a whim. thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is' b'that jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not' b'to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be' b'exceptions.) catholics, as is typical with catholic ethics, take a' b'theoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through' b'the process of anullment. in the last discussion most of our' b'non-catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that' b'in some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a' b'feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of' b'helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that' b'come up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce' b'should not be necessary. --clh]'
