b'' b'i don\'t know if this routine is "standard", i just came up with it recently:' b'for a polygon of points p1...pn, and a point p, make a table as follows:' b't(1)= angle from p1 to p to p2' b't(2)= angle from p2 to p to p3' b'...' b't(n)= angle from pn to p to p1' b'express all angles as: -pi angle pi.' b'add all entries in the table. if the sum the point is outside. if' b'the sum is pi, the point is inside. if the point is xpi, you' b'have a strange polygon. if any angle was +/-pi, the point is on the' b'border.' b'' b"i think it's known, but it's neat." b'' b'can it be extended to 3d?' b'' b'john nagle'
