b'' b"i was watching peter gammons on espn last night, and he's got me a little" b'confused.' b'' b'while talking about expansion, he started mentioning people who might benefit' b"from the fringe players they'll be facing: mcgriff hitting home runs," b"sheffield getting rbi's, and glavine winning games. this was," b'of course, all in reference to what happened the *other* times that baseball' b"has expanded (early 60's, late 60's, late 70's)." b'' b'what really confused me, though, was the mention of *al* players who would' b'do well next year. specifically, roger clemens winning games, and the' b'likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting home runs.' b'' b'my question is: how in the hell will the rockies/marlins help the al? the' b"last time i looked, there wasn't a lot of talent jumping leagues. did i" b'miss something?' b'' b'only if you persist in believing that peter gammons is more knowledgable about' b"baseball than the average mailbox. okay, i'm overstating. still, the man" b'actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the nl this' b'year did not pitch in the majors last year.' b'' b'huh?' b'' b'imo, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the' b'other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues.' b"in gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the al as well, some" b'increase will be seen. he also gets credit for mentioning that the jump' b"in offense was due also to the rules changes after the season. he's still" b'full of it...' b'' b'' b'--' b'"if you take out all the f--ks, this is an page book."' b"-wally backman, leafing though a copy of mets teammate lenny dykstra's" b'autobiography, _nails_'
