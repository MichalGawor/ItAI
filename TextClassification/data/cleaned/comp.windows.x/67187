b'' b'' b'hi xperts!' b'i have a sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.' b'previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications and then' b'i upgraded my system to sun o.s. and realized that the hard' b'disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. my immediate alternative' b'was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. this resulted in' b'not loading openwindows. as a result of which none of the x-libraries got loaded.' b'' b'i am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/x11 files' b'required for running x-windows and compiling my programs written for xlib and xaw.' b'in a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libx*.* files from' b'the tape /usr/bin/x11/* and /usr/include/x11/* is this enough for running x-windows' b'' b'but i did not get /usr/lib/x11/fonts/ sub directories these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi' b'and misc.' b'' b'when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/x11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the' b'default path. but the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no' b'disk space.' b'are there any temporary suggestions before i get a gb disk and load openwindows to' b'just have my x-windows running.' b'' b'thanks' b'' b'pramod' b'' b'--'
