b'' b'forwarded from doug griffith, magellan project manager' b'' b'magellan status report' b'april b'' b'1. the magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally, gathering' b'gravity data to plot the density variations of venus in the' b'mid-latitudes. the solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees' b'and spacecraft temperatures dropped degrees c.' b'' b'2. an end-to-end test of the delayed aerobraking data readout' b'process was conducted this week in preparation for the transition' b'experiment. there was some difficulty locking up to the data frames,' b'and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in' b'equipment at the tracking station.' b'' b'3. magellan has completed orbits of venus and is now days' b'from the end of cycle and the start of the transition experiment.' b'' b'4. magellan scientists were participating in the brown-vernadsky' b'microsymposium at brown university in providence, ri, this week. this' b'joint meeting of u.s. and russian venus researchers has been' b'continuing for many years.' b'' b'5. a three-day simulation of transition experiment aerobraking' b'activities is planned for next week, including orbit trim maneuvers' b'and starcal (star calibration) orbits.' b'___ b'| jet propulsion lab b'___| m/s telos the aweto from new zealand' b'/___| pasadena, ca is part caterpillar and' b'|_____|/ part vegetable.' b''
