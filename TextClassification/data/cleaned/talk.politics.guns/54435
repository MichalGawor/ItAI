b'' b"a poster claims he 'always asks [anti-gunners] what they think would" b"be reasonable personal firepower restrictions'. ok then b'' b'caliber not greater than b'muzzle not greater than ft/lbs with any combo of bullet wt/vel' b'action single shot rifles and single action revolvers' b' revolvers bearing no more than six rounds and incorporating' b" an 'anti-fanning' mechanism to discourage roy rogers wannabes." b'bullets any non-explosive variety, hps just fine.' b'' b'now these specs leave the h&r magnum as about the most powerful' b'allowable civie cartridge for handgun or rifle use. it would be' b'reasonably effective against home intruders, muggers, rabid wolves' b'and other such nasties, even with the firearm-type limitations. at the' b'same time, this caliber/power limit would reduce the ultimate lethality' b'of hits.' b'' b'i suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical' b'"assault weapon". you are wrong. compared to what most criminals use, a' b'9mm with military ammo (fmjs), or a military rifle (use is extremely' b'rare), or 7.62mm with military ammo (fmjs), the h&r magnum with' b'"civie" bullets is more lethal. most of the arms which criminals (and' b'the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.' b'' b'what if we just punish the criminal and leave the law abiding citizen' b"alone? it hasn't been tried in recient times, but it might work."
