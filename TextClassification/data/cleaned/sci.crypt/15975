b'' b' ever since craig rowland posted his piece "new encryption"' b'to sci.crypt there has been some discussion of our company,' b'secured communications technologies, inc, and on encryption' b'algorithm, nea.' b'' b'the classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from' b'friedman:' b'' b'"no new cypher is worth considering unless it comes' b'from someone who has already broken a very hard one."' b'' b"historically, friedman has been right. it's really hard to develop" b"a good cypher. ibm's lucifer, the precursor to des, turns out to have" b'been fatally flawed. most of the des-like systems other than des seem' b'to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. the first two tries at' b'public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken. most' b'if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were' b'broken eventually. attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption' b'have been disappointing; the classic "a survey of data insecurity packages"' b'in cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the' b'popular "security packages" of the late 1980s.' b'' b'a new, proprietary algorithm? no way.' b'' b'if the us is permitting general export of this thing, it has' b"to be weak; that's how the current regulations work. currently there's" b'a willingness to allow systems with short keys bits appears to be' b'no problem; the bits of des are too many) or weak algorithms' b'(i think word perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.' b"i can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the" b"pto and the state department's arms control division without finding that out." b'' b'john nagle' b'' b"p.s. no, i'm not thrilled with clipper either, but that's a different issue."
