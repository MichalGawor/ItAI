b'' b'| has anyone looked into the possiblity of a proton/centaur combo?' b'| what would be the benefits and problems with such a combo (other' b'| than the obvious instability in the xssr now)?' b'|' b'|' b'| the centaur for the altas is about meters dia. and the proton' b"| is so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the block-d" b"| which sets inside a shround just under meters dia. i don't know about" b'| launch loads, etc.. but since the centaur survives titan launches which' b"| are probably worse than the proton (those titan srb's probably shake things" b'| up pretty good) it seems feasible. except, the centaur is a very fragile' b'| thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.' b'| protons are assembled and transported horizontially. does anyone know' b'| how much stress in the way of a payload a centaur could support while' b'| bolted to a proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track' b'| and erected on the pad?' b'' b'the centaur that is being built for t4 would be a better bet to integrate' b'onto the proton as the t4/centaur is designed for the extremely harsh' b'envorinment of the t4 launch. it is also closer to m in diameter.' b'' b"you've hit on the real kicker, however. the centaur is pressure stabilized." b'it cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. additionally,' b'the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to psi.' b'that is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. the pressure' b'stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. on numerous occasions' b'(when i was there the af wanted to see what it would take to make' b'a non-pressure stabilized centaur. the answer a centaur not worth launching.' b'' b'the atlas/centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the t4/centaur' b'does. i believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the' b'cleanliness requirements and pfl configuration, so maybe something can be' b'done there........' b'' b'' b'|' b'| they would also need lox and lh facilities added to the proton pads' b'| (unless the new proton second stage is actually built), and of course' b'| any centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the' b'| us at great cost. these systems may viloate us law so there are political' b'| problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the cis you mention.' b'' b'the addition of lox/lh facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it' b"lifts off. a lhe facility is also needed. i don't know what the proton uses" b"for fuel, but since they are derived from icbm's i would suspect that they" b"use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's" b'do. if there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems' b'could be big not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with' b'providing centaur gse to russia. that issue alone might be enough to kill' b'this idea.' b'' b'--' b'h.d. stevens' b'aerospace robotics laboratory\t\tphone:\t(415) (lab)' b'durand building\t\t\t\t\t(415) (bullpen)' b'stanford, ca 94305\t\t\tfax:\t(415)
