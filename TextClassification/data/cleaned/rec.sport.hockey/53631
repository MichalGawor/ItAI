b'' b'well put, jason. i am not from wisconsin, but i have close relatives who' b'live in port washington (about minutes north of milwaukee), i visit the' b'city regularly, and i have been in the bradley four times to see the admirals' b'play and the ncaa hockey championships. it is a beautiful building. the' b'pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in' b'north america.' b'as to what will happen with the admirals if milwaukee does acquire a' b'franchise, word is the team will move to green bay and play in the brown' b'county arena.' b'once again, the admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of' b'milwaukee have been supporting them well. the games i have been to have seen' b'crowds anywhere from to which are numbers some nhl teams (i.e.' b'the islanders, hartford, new jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.' b'plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without' b'the glamour of having an nhl club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount' b'of hockey interest exists in the city.' b'' b'sincerely,' b'' b'martin hill, rt. box 155b, sault ste. marie, mi (home of lssu: go lakers!)' b'' b'p.s. anybody know what the attendance figures are for the ihl and how' b'milwaukee stacks up against other ihl cities such as atlanta, phoenix, san' b'diego, cleveland, and cincinnati? if so, please reply.'
