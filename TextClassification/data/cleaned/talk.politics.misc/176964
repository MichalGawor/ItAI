b'' b"-btw, i'm a walc (white aryan lapsed catholic)" b'-' b'---' b'-' b'i would like to go on record as objecting to mr. hentrich calling' b"himself an aryan. the word `aryan' is of sanskrit origin and occurs first" b'in the hindu scripture, the rigveda. it seems to have been a tribal term' b'but may have had connotations of good character. such connotations' b'are quite explicit in the sayings of the buddha who called his religion the' b'eightfold aryan path. the word was borrowed by the german scholar' b"max mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the" b"nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is" b"synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely. the people who" b'originally called themselves aryas, the iranians, noprth indians, the afghans' b'and possibly the kurds, are none of them nordic. so the use of the word' b'by westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is' b'nontheless inappropriate. the only westerners who may have some claim' b'to call themselves aryans (by descent) are the celts who seem to have wor-' b'shipped a god called aryaman who is mentioned in the rigveda.' b'' b"if you want to check what i am saying, look at mallory's book, ``in" b'search of the indo-europeans" or, just look at the encyclopedia britannica.' b'the reason this usage is offensive is that most of ancient indian literature' b'as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the aryans and' b'for westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible' b'things done by germans to jews, using a word to which the germans have' b'no clear claim.' b'' b'rohit parikh'
