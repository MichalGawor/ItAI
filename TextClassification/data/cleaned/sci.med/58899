b'' b'i remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity' b'which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring' b'from the diet. the theory which was backed up by interesting anecdotal' b'results is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these' b"chemicals than other people. i don't remember any connection being made" b"with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet." b'' b'yeah, the "feingold diet" is a load of crap. children diagnosed with add' b'who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and' b'social skills, which in fact continue to decline. of course, the parents' b'who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their' b'children\'s development. so much for the value of "interesting anecdotal' b'results". people will believe anything if they want to.' b'' b'--' b'steve dyer'
