b'' b'' b' just curious, how would the clipper chip system handle' b' conference calls?' b'' b"it's not clipper, it's any encryption system. i've seen a number of" b'designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.' b'' b'depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same' b'key, it can be done. for example, i was using "vat", which is an' b'internet audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the' b"session. (unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't" b"have the cpu for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different" b'site)' b'' b"so, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge. but if" b'you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the' b'conversation....' b'' b'-derek' b'' b'' b'--' b"derek atkins, mit electrical engineering and computer science" b'secretary, mit student information processing board (sipb)' b'mit media laboratory, speech research group'
