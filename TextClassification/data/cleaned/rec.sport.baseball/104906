b'' b'' b"one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't" b'yet been addressed. i believe the rule also does *not* deal with this' b'situation:' b'' b'if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up' b'and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.' b'' b'however, if the infield fly is *not* caught, at what point can a' b'runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for' b'advancing too early? when the' b'ball hits the ground? when a fielder first touches the ball after it' b'hits the ground?' b'' b'enlightenment would be appreciated.' b'' b"i'm not sure i understand this question. when the if rule is invoked," b'the batter is automatically out. this relieves the runners from being' b'forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. other' b"than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on" b'a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? that is,' b'if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and' b'if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.' b'' b'-----' b'eric smith' b'ci$: b''
