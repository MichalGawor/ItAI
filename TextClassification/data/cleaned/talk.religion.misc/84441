b'' b' eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting' b' god. if you choose to jump off a cliff, you can hardly blame god for you' b' going *splat* at the bottom. he knows that if you choose to jump, that' b' you will die but he will not prevent you from making that choice. in fact,' b' he sent his son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what' b' lies below. to prove that point, jesus took that plunge himself but he being' b' god was able to rise up again. i have seen the example of christ and have' b" chosen not to jump and i'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you'll" b' go *splat*.' b'' b" you don't have to listen to me and i won't stop you if you decide to jump." b' i only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge. you owe it to' b" yourself. i don't like seeing anyone go *splat*." b'' b"i'm for the moment interested in this notion of the 'leap of faith'" b'established by kierkegaard. it clearly points out a possible solution' b"to transcendental values. what i don't understand is that it also" b'clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any' b'transcendental direction is equal.' b'' b'in other words i might not jump off the cliff mentioned above,' b'but at the same time i will decide to what direction i will go.' b'actually i will do it just now.' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
