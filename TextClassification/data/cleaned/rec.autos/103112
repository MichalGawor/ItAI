b'' b'i am considering buying an new car, so i called three insurance' b'companies in california to get estimates. i asked for the same' b'coverage and same deductibles. most of the companies charge you' b'according to your zip code. others charge according to your city.' b"anyhow, i gave the same zip code and city to all three places. here's" b"what i found (for a integra gs):" b'' b'aaa: ~$2000/yr.' b'state farm: 2614.92/yr.' b'allstate: 1220/yr.' b'' b'aaa is non-profit, so they said i could also expect to receive about' b'$200-300 back at the end of the year.' b'' b'still, there is a huge gap between all of these companies. state farm' b'wants more than twice as much as allstate. i think i should be' b"suspicious, but i've never heard anybody else complain." b'' b'any comments?' b'' b'thanks,' b'gregg l. kasten'
