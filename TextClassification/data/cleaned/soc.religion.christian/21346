b'' b'' b' a christian friend of mine once reasoned that if we were never created, then' b' we could not exist. therefore we were created, and therefore there exists a' b' creator.' b'' b' is this statement considered to be a valid proof by many christians (and' b' followers of other religions, i suppose)? [rest deleted]' b'' b'some variant is quite popular. this, and other arguments, are' b'discussed in john leslie mackie\'s "the miracle of theism: arguments' b'for and against the existence of god". although mackie ultimately' b'sides with "against", his arguments are, i think, quite fair to both' b'sides. brief discussions can be found in the alt.atheism faqs.' b'--' b'bruce cmsr, university of liverpool'
