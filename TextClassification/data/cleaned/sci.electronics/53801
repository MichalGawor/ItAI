b'' b'' b"the fujitsu uses what is known as an 'smd' interface (storage module" b'device?). a lot of older minis used it. sun still does on their server' b'models. there are several different speeds of smd, and i think that the' b'fuji drive you have is rated at about mb/sec (thats megabits). there' b'used to be several companies that made couplers for the pc (interphase in' b'texas being one), but i think that the market pretty much has dried up.' b'controllers for this type of drive are readily available for vme buses' b'though. rumor has it that there is a smd to scsi adapter available, but' b'i think that it was designed for slower smd devices. in other words,' b'if you have a pc or mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.' b'cheers,' b'corwin'
