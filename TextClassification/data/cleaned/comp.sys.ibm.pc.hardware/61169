b'' b"i've posted a couple of notes about encountering this problem. based on some" b'suggestions from:' b'' b'mark aitchison, university of canterbury, new zealand.' b'and' b'' b'i think that my problem is a screen saver that also outputs sound (to my' b"pc speaker). i'm still looking at some of the other screen savers that i" b'use (with a randomizer), but this one definately caused the loss of several' b'minutes over night (but not the date this time).' b'--' b'barry sardis\t\t| home: b'1241 laurie avenue\t| office: b'san jose, ca 95125\t| fax:
