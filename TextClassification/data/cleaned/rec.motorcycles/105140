b'' b'nh trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my cb360t... are' b'nhthere any easy ways to do this (i.e. a "slip-in" bulb replacement)?' b'' b'no. the honda 360s employed a sealed beam which was not interchangeable' b"with anything else, so far as i could ever tell. i've owned two 360s" b'over the years, and that was always one of my biggest nits.' b'' b"i'm not sure how far standardisation went, but on two of my bikes (the" b"gs550b and, i think, the gt380m) i was able to pop a cibie' insert directly" b'into the original housing (held in by those roughly w-shaped springs). the' b'inserts used 55/60w halogen bulbs, and were great, although mr bill later' b'indicates that this may be too much of a drain on your charging system.' b'' b'gsx600f, rg250wd.\tsi=2.66 "you porsche. me pass!"\tdod
