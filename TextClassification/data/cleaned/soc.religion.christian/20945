b'' b'[bits deleted]' b' i am told that planned parenthood/siecus-style "values-free" methods, that' b' teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make "choices",' b' actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. i posted a long article on this a while' b' back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested. b'' b' the same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula' b' were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens. i assume that it is' b' reasonable to assume that the aids rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy' b' rate.' b'' b"i'd be fascinated to see such evidence, please send me your article!" b'on the negative side however, i suspect that any such simplistic link' b'abstinence-education decreased pregnancy,' b'contraceptive-education increased pregnancy' b"is false. the us, which i'd guess has one of the largest proportion of" b'"non-liberal" sex education in the western world also has one of the highest' b'teenage pregnancy rates. (please correct me if my guess is wrong.)' b'' b'--'
