b'' b'hi everyone. just the other day, i ordered a vram chip for my new lciii from' b'mac connection. they sent it overnight (very nice) and i got it installed,' b"and we found that it didn't work properly. when you put the computer in" b'thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering' b"and fuzzy. so i called them up and i'm going to return it for a new one." b'' b'my question is, how often does such a thing happen with simm chips in general?' b'do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? is this' b"a rarity? this is the first chip i've ordered so i have no other experience" b"in this area. i'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of" b'experience.' b'' b"that's about it. please email me, and if people want, i can post a summary." b'thanks all.' b'--' b'' b'"is rot13 rotated forward or backward?"' b'--anonymous'
