b'' b"i'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the" b'distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?' b'' b'yes, you could.' b'' b'seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength' b'and determine distance. this would be for short distances ft),' b'and i would need to have accuracy of inches, or so.' b'' b'well, letsee (whipping out hp-48sx, soon to be gx): inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5' b"nanoseconds resolution. hmm. that'll be rather difficult!" b'' b'the more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally' b'somewhere around 40khz. sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light' b'(radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.' b'' b'what frequencies would be best for this? or does matter?' b'' b'it might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous' b'"sonic estimator" type devices that do what you want here. many are pretty' b'cheap too (in fact, for awhile the stanley estimator was selling' b"for something like that's the one i bought! b'' b'---joel kolstad'
