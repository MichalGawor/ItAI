b'' b'i plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as i have working' b'code, which i will also include. the intersection of planes method' b'looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in' b"graphics gems i doesn't work. i may be misinterpreting, of course." b'' b'i had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor' b'of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better. in either' b'case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution' b'of linear equations).' b'' b'to get the planes, i was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,' b'p1 to p2, and setting the normal as the "normalized" vector from p1 to p2.' b'these just plugged into the formula in graphics gems. however, the resulting' b'center point is only occasionally equidistant from all of my test points' b'(for different tests). my matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like' b'i need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which' b"will require bringing in another routine i don't have (but should be easy to" b'find).' b'' b'another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by sets' b'of points, and intersecting the normals from there. this would also define' b'the circle center. however, small numerical imprecisions would make the' b'lines not intersect. supposedly planes have to intersect in a unique' b'point if they are not parallel.' b'' b'ed' b'' b'thanks to all who answered so far.' b'--' b'ed bolson' b'university of washington cardiovascular research
