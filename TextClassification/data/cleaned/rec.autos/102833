b'' b'' b'dear netters:' b'' b"i am looking to buy a used eagle talon or tsi awd." b"question is that the tsi awd was mentioned in the" b'april consumer reports to a car to avoid!' b'' b'in particular, the manual transmission, electrical system,' b'and brakes were below par (in both models). a friend of mine' b"ownes a tsi awd and he has had brake jobs (pads), one" b'stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something' b"about sticking/grinding into second gear. this doesn't seem" b'too bad if one "beats" on his car.' b'' b'i am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks. seems' b'you have to pay big buck if you want all three. anyway can' b'anyone please let me know how you like your talon, and any' b'problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.' b'' b'thanks for any responses!' b'' b'-jay'
