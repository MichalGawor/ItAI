b'' b'' b'i am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9v to my' b'cpu board which runs at 5-6v. the optoisolator is a 4n35.' b'on the led side, i put the signal i want through a 10k resistor' b'to the base of a 2n2222. on the transistor side, i tie my' b'cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor' b'of 47k.' b'' b'it functions ok, but seems very slow. i can detect pulses' b"that occur at about 2khz, but not much faster. isn't the" b'rise/fall time of this device, something like 5us? i should' b"be able to detect my target of 40khz, but i can't get 16khz." b'this is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu' b"and to the test pin are about inches long, but i'm not" b'doing anything high-speed.' b'' b'in the art of electronics, it mentions tying the base of the' b'phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the' b'speed. is that what i need to do? how do i calculate the' b'resistor value?' b'' b'' b'--' b'' b'paul malenfant'
