b'' b'' b' i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my' b' wife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, catholic liturgy. in the last fe' b" years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass. it's" b' driving me crazy! the most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is' b' that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how' b' do it. led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we' b" present to god. but the best masses i've been to were participatory prayers." b'' b'on the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the' b'same. john has described some of these. on the other hand, some people' b"seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better" b'when things get changed around. i think innovative priests and liturgy' b'committees are trying to get our attention and make things more' b'meaningful for us. it drives me crazy too.' b'' b'different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy. my' b'local parish is innovative. i prefer to go to mass at the next parish' b"over. sometimes we don't have the option of attending a mass in the" b'style which best suits us. john put a smiley on it but to "just offer' b'it up" probably is the solution.' b'' b'a related issue, that it sounds like john does not have to deal with, is' b'that spouses may have different liturgical tastes. my husband does like' b'innovative litury. it is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual' b'needs without just going our separate ways. when you include the factor' b"of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty" b'complicated.' b'' b'one thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial mass is still' b'mass.' b''
