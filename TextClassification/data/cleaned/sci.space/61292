b'' b'date: tue, apr gmt' b'i would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for humans.' b'i am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range' b'of physical aspects of the planet. the question is what physical aspects' b'simply disallow earth like conditions.' b'' b'eg temperature range of 280k to 315k (where temp is purely dependant on dist' b' from the sun and the suns temperature..)' b' atmospheric presure i know nothing of human tolerance' b'' b'there are people who have adapted to high altitudes in the andes and in' b'tibet. i suspect that it took them several generations to make the' b'adaptation because europeans had difficulty making the adaptation. they' b'had to send the women to a lower altitude when they were pregnant in order' b'to insure sucessful childbirth.' b'' b' planetary mass again gravity at surface is important, how much' b' can human bodies take day after day. also how does the mass effect' b' atmosphere. i thinking of planets between and times mass of the' b' earth. i suppose density should be important as well.' b'' b'' b'another factor you should consider is the x-ray opacity of the atmosphere' b'in case of stellar flares, the uv opacity is also important because uv' b'radiation can kill or damage microbes, plants, and animals.' b'' b'climate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc. just the above' b'three factors and how they relate to one another.' b''
