b'' b':i tried this code yesterday. on my sparcstation elc it takes over' b":300 seconds to compress seconds' worth of speech. this means that it" b':needs to be "optimized" by over a factor of before it will be usable' b':in even a half-duplex mode.' b'' b'ouch! thanks for trying it.' b'' b':i question whether celp is the best approach for this application. it produces' b':great compression but at the expense of tremendous cpu loads. we want' b":something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end pc's" b':without dsp cards. my guess is that some other algorithm is going to be' b':a better starting point.' b'' b"yes. i'm not sure if my xposting to comp.speech made it to here too, but" b"i've found that a low sample rate samples/sec at bits per sample)" b"plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get" b'speech into 14.4k with a simdgen left over. this is *definitely* worth' b'working on, folks. and shorten works in well under real-time.' b'' b'g'
