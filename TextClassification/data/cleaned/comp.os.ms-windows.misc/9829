b'' b'' b'dear friend,' b' the risc means "reduced instruction set computer". the risc usually has' b'small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase' b'the clock rate to have a high performance. you can read some books about' b'computer architecture for more information about risc.' b'' b'hmm... not that i am an authority on risc but i clearly remember' b'reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large.' b'the difference is in addressing modes risc instruction sets are not' b'as orthogonal is cisc.' b'' b'--' b'' b"theoretically supposed to be reduced.... not any longer. that's why everyone" b'is arguing about risc v.s. cisc. personally, i think cisc will win out.' b'just take a look at the pentium! (not that i like intel architectures either,' b"but that's another story...)" b'' b'bye!' b'' b'' b'do you mean that the pentium is better than a risc? or that it will outsell' b'them all? if the first, you have to remember that intel cisc (like the' b'pentium) are a always a generation away from the best riscs... also riscs' b'cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities (not' b'even on the same order)... but i remember reading about years (maybe b'about a t800(?) from hypercube that did a mips, was superscallar and' b'reordered its instruction itself so'
