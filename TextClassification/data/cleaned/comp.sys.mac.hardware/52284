b'' b'the first problem was the sound. i tried the m0, but then even the logon was' b"muted. i don't want that. any other suggestions for that hissing?" b'' b'the second is really strange. first, i kept mentioning that fc slowed down' b'all the time and took too long. well i just logged on with extensions off and' b"i didn't have any slowdown. also, last time i was online i quit (which" b"usually disconnects and quits). it disconnected but it wouldn't quit. i had" b'to force quit, and then when i launched fc again it said the modem port was in' b'use. this is really strange. i thought it might have to do with fax' b'software. or the restart could have reset the modem port (a more likely' b'explanation). so, any suggestions?' b'' b'-david' b'' b'**** from planet bmug, the firstclass bbs of bmug. the message contained in' b"**** this posting does not in any way reflect bmug's official views." b''
