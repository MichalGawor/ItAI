b'' b'' b'' b'grr. hate the bastard who picked the weather for today.' b'' b'went up to visit a friend overnight (about minute ride).. rode up after' b'work, only minor drizzing for the last minutes of the ride... rest of the' b'ride was very zen.' b'' b'got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks stuff to work' b'on her computers with, rainy as all hell. soaked and cold by the time i got' b'home.' b'' b'since i didn\'t have another set of thermals which were dry, i said "to heck' b'with it" and drove my cage back up.' b'' b'lo and behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm' b"yellow thing i haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when i was minutes" b'into the trip.' b'' b'and me in my cage. oh joy.' b'' b'' b'happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the' b'bike when i first got it, put on an emgo replacement mirror... hated it the' b"entire time that thing was on my bike because i couldn't see a damned thing" b"through it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you" b'get a narrow angle wobbly blur)... and i got a replacement windshield for my' b'fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but' b'annoying)... so i spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing' b'them this afternoon.' b'' b"'bout the only thing i still hate about the bike cb360t) is the damned" b'"2 d-cell flashlight" headlight.' b'' b'has anyone seen a good source for watt halogen passing lights? since' b"the charging system on the cb360t can't handle continuous use of a 50w" b'halogen headlight, i was thinking about putting a couple passing lights' b'on... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding i do,' b'but wouldn\'t drain the battery during "normal use" (chiefly day trips and' b'commuting to work and back)...'
