b'' b'' b'howdy,' b'' b'sorry if this has been covered before:' b'' b'one of my pc illiterate friends asked me to help him install drdos on his' b'nec powermate sx (386sx of course, i said "no problem" and went to work.' b'unfortunately, the drdos refuses to recognize the hard drive during' b'installation, even though i am still able to boot off of the hard drive using' b'the old dos. after openning it up i discovered it was using an 8-bit' b'seagate scsi controller on a st-157n scsi 40mbtye drive. i then booted' b'with drdos off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if' b'i could access the drive. lo and behold the primary mbyte partition' b"was intact (created by dos no less, i didn't think you could go over a" b'32mbyte partition in the older doses. i could be wrong...). i then tried' b"to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do. i am" b'unaware of anything special that has to be done with a scsi drive (i' b'kinda expected it to work just like an ide/mfm/rll drive for dos' b'installations). any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for' b'"throw it in the garbage and buy a new pc")...' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'' b'paul "mr. scsi... not!" fincke'
