b'' b'i had the same question for my 55lb nec 5fg monitor. the apple guy said that' b'their 50lb monitor is ok to put ontop of the centris and had no coment' b'beyond that. i was going to just put the nec on the box but then i got to' b'thinking the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight' b"would be more concentrated than with apple's (i don't know the area of the" b'base of their tilt/swivel). additionally, the cdrom drive is in the middle.' b'so i cut a piece of thick wood to about x covered it in a' b"cream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the centris's top" b'and the monitor!!' b'' b'' b"**************** i hate *chipsoft's* macintax b''
