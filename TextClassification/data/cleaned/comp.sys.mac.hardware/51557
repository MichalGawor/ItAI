b'' b" i'm in the market for a post-script compatible laser writer. my needs" b' are pretty modest so dpi, pages a minute would be just fine.' b' my budget is also pretty modest, so inexpensive would also be good.' b' it will be working from a single mac, but networkability would' b' probably be a good investment for the future.' b'' b'with that in mind...' b'' b' anyone have comments about the suitability/quality/value of a gcc' b' blp elite printer?' b'' b'i just recently purchased the gcc blp elite and i really like it. my' b'needs' b'are much the same as what you describe. in addition, i wanted to get one' b'that' b'i could access via appletalk, so that eliminated the new line of' b'inexpensive' b'printers from apple. the print quality is good to excellent based on' b'what' b"font you're using and what paper you use. i'm still experimenting with" b'different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work' b'fine.' b'' b'printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed' b'jobs is' b'very easy. there is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of' b'the' b"sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet" b'from' b'the sheet feeder, as some do).' b'' b'(i have no affiliation with gcc, just a satisfied customer.)' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'earl d. fife department of mathematics' b'(616)957-6403 grand rapids, mi b'' b'========================================================================='
