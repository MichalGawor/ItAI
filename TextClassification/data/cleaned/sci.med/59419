b'' b'' b'i used to be on lopid. it did a good job of reducing cholesterol b'down to around as well as ldl and triglycerides. then, i got' b'pneumonia, and for some reason, the lopid stopped working very well;' b'cholesterol and triglycerides soared. the levels might have stabilized' b'over time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch' b'to mevicore.' b'' b'on mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to ldl was b"and hdl was but the trig's were still" b'very high, around and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal,' b'sgot (n ggtp(?hard to read copy) (n b'' b'he said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him' b'concern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol' b'figures. he had me stop the mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("just' b'to be extra cautious, though i\'m sure it\'s not a problem."),' b'and wants me to go back on it after that. i suggested maybe lopid might' b"be the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what" b"i want to do. but lopid has one particular side effect i'm not fond of." b'' b'should the above liver and trig figures be feared? what happens to' b'folks with high trig levels? is my liver in danger with the above' b'results? would i be better off on lopid, despite its inconvenient' b'side effect, or, perhaps, some other drug? (niacin affected my' b'liver, too).'
