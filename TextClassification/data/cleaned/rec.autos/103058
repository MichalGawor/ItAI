b'' b'here is a story. i bought a car about two weeks ago. i finally can' b'get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence' b"history of the car. in between and the instrument pannel" b'of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset' b'to zero. therefore, the true meter reading is the reading before' b'replacement plus current mileage. that shows mile difference' b'comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from. the' b'dealer never told me anything about that important story.' b'' b'i hope that i can return the car with full refund. do u think this' b'is possible? does anyone have similar experiences? any comments' b'will be appreciated. thanks.' b''
