b'' b'' b'i was playing this golf game and something interesting happened.' b'on the 7th hole, i drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was' b'in mid-flight, the game completely froze. a couple seconds later, the' b'screen went completely black, with an error message in large "bubble"' b'letters that said division by zero. i thought it was funny considering' b'i am a computer programmer, and i had never seen an error like this on' b'an actual video game system like sega or nintendo (or even atari or' b'intellevision years ago). oh yeah, after the message, there was also' b'what must have been an address, in hexadecimal. i forget the exact hex' b'code that was given. has this happened to anyone else??? it must have,' b"my game shouldn't have been the only one to do this." b'' b'thanks' b'randy' b'psc'
