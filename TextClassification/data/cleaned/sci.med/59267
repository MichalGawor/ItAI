b'' b'does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly? does' b'short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after' b'the use of the drug? my grandmother recently had to be hospitalized' b'and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks. although the' b'drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly' b'senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone' b'and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance. it' b'seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the' b'course of just one and one-half months. i have to believe that the' b'combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part' b'catalysts for this. any comments?' b'' b'--'
