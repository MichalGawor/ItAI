b'' b'' b'i have an se/30 with a meg hd which dates back to april when i' b'originally purchased it, i experienced the failure to boot problem. this' b'was fixed soon after by a rom upgrade on the hard drive.' b'' b'lately a similar problem has been occuring. when the computer is' b'powered on the hd light flashes a few times and then i am given' b'the "no disk to boot from" icon. however, upon turing the' b'computer off and on again the drive always boots up just fine.' b'furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off i press the reboot' b'button the same problem occurs. but, as i said, turning the power' b'off and on always works.' b'' b'this problem is different from the boot problem in that before' b'it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.' b'' b'does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how' b'it can be fixed?' b'' b"i'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to" b'"come up to speed" now. is there a pram or scsi setting that' b'allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before' b'trying to access the hd?' b'' b'thanks!' b'' b'' b'altan j. stalker' b'indiana university' b'computer science dept.' b'' b''
