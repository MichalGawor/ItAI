b'' b'' b"i'm considering switching to geico insurance, but have heard that" b'they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim. i was' b'worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim. i have' b'also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident.' b'' b"don't worry about this they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do" b"make a claim. they'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end" b'when they leave you in the lurch.' b'' b"i've read in this group that geico has funded the purchasing of radar" b"guns by police depts (i'm not sure where)." b'more than that. geico funded the company that developed lidar. when locals' b'showed a reluctance to buy the units, geico started giving them away. i' b"know they've given units to the florida highway patrol, county sheriff's a" b'and some local governments.' b'the real question is why? this is the hook. geico, and other ins. co.s can' b'tell which drivers represent risk. this is a determination they can make' b"after you receive a speeding ticket from one of geico's lidar units. most" b'drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but' b"this gives them the opportunity to raise rates for equal risk. it's called" b'extra profits. they also know how silly the nsl is, and how it is almost' b'universally ignored. driving in excess of the nsl gets you a ticket, an' b"increase in your rates, points on your license but it doesn't make you" b'a riskier driver to insure.' b'like the sound of this? like the people who thought up the scheme? go geico!' b'' b"unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go" b"with one of the major companies and stay there. you'll get long term customer" b'discounts on your premiums. now, about the of your premium that is paid as' b"commission. that's another story for another day."
