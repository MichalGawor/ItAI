b'' b'' b'...text of options "a" and "b" deleted...' b'' b'option c single core launch station.' b'this is the jsc lead option. basically, you take a ft diameter' b"cylinder that's ft long, slap space shuttle main engines on" b'the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a' b'regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket' b'motors, and launch the can. some key features are:' b' complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout' b' tangentially mounted fixed solar panels' b' body mounted radiators (which adds protection against' b' micrometeroid orbital debris)' b' centerline docking ports (one on each end)' b' berthing ports' b' a single pressurized volume, approximately cubic feet' b' (twice the volume of skylab).' b' floors, center passageway between floors' b' kw of housekeeping power' b'' b'somehow i have a strange attraction for this idea (living in' b'a modular home maybe has altered my mind). the only thing' b"that scares me is the part about simply strapping ssme's and" b'a nosecone on it and "just launching it." i have this vision' b'of something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the' b'complete loss of the new modular space station (not just a peice of' b'it as would be the case with staged in-orbit construction).' b'' b'i certainly like this "option c"... it\'s much more like the original' b"phase b studies from the early 1970's. good stuff!" b'' b'--' b''
