b'' b'' b'' b'some recent postings remind me that i had read about risks' b'associated with the barbecuing of foods, namely that carcinogens' b'are generated. is this a valid concern? if so, is it a function' b'of the smoke or the elevated temperatures? is it a function of' b'the cooking elements, wood or charcoal vs. lava rocks? i wish' b'to know more. thanks.' b'' b'i recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and then' b'drips down onto the hot elements--whatever they are--that the extreme' b'heat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or more' b'carcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smoke.' b'' b"--the ol' professor"
