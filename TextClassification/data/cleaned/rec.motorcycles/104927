b'' b"i've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent" b'experience passengering with dave edmondson at pilot while in london.' b'' b'i found that it upset the bike much less if i rode with the pilot, that' b'is, if i looked over his shoulder and anticipated when i should hold on' b'hard for braking or acceleration. i tried to always look over the' b'inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leaving' b'dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and' b'luggage.' b'' b'hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit' b'off the back is hard to fight. similarly, i held on to the grab handles' b"tightly when dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (i'm" b'a lot bigger than he is...). reaching around him and pushing off the' b'tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for' b'him to manage.' b'' b'on the rare occasions when i carry a passenger myself, i absolutely' b"refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. that's" b"helmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. it's" b"not my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibility" b'to require it if they want to ride.' b'' b"and i agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience" b"carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried" b'many passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration before' b"you head off to a difficult road like mines/mt. hamilton. that's a" b'nasty place to find yourself in trouble.' b'------------------------------------------------------------------' b'rule never sell a ducati.
