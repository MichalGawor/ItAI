b'' b"let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a" b'boat, but it could be anything. on the drawing you have a set of' b'reference points whose true x,y positions are known.' b'' b'now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using yaron' b"danon's excellent digitize program). that is, you use a program which" b'converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click' b'the mouse.' b'' b'upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come' b'out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways' b'from the known true values. this is understandable because the' b'scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are' b'successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and' b'contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,' b'scanner errors and what have you.' b'' b'the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global"' b'adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or' b'rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.' b'' b'so the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for' b'removing such distortion? in particular, if i have three sets of' b'points' b'' b'reference(x,y) (the known true values)' b'' b'distortedreference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)' b'' b'distorteddata(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)' b'' b'what function of reference and distorted could i apply to' b'distorteddata to remove the errors.' b'' b'i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted' b'reference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3d' b'surface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to remove' b'the errors in the other data points.' b'' b'it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least' b'a reasonable model of the class of distortion. below is a very short' b'description of the process which we use; if you have further questions,' b'feel free to poke me via e-mail.' b'' b'================================================================' b'*assume: locally smooth distortion' b'' b'0) compute the delaunay triangulation of your (x,y) points. this' b'defines the set of neighbors for each point. if your data are' b'not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.' b'consider deleting these edges.' b'' b'1) now, there are two goals:' b'' b'a) move the distorteddata(x,y) to the reference(x,y)' b"b) keep the length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)" b'as close as possible to the digitizedlength(e) (as measured' b"using the digitized (x,y)'s)." b'' b'2) for every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b). for' b'example:' b'' b'a) for (x,y) points for which you know the reference(x,y), you' b'can move alpha0*(reference(x,y) current(x,y)). this will' b'slowly move the distortedreference(x,y) towards the' b'reference(x,y).' b'b) for all other points, examine the current length of each edge.' b'for each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge' b'the correct length (where "correct" is the digitizedlength).' b'take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the' b'point alpha1*sumofedgedisplacements. this will keep the' b'triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh.' b'' b'3) iterate until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).' b'' b'alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation. consider' b'how much you believe the reference(x,y) i.e., do you absolutely insist' b'on the final points exactly matching the references, or do you want to' b'balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length' b'of the edges.' b'' b'warning: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be' b"observed (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and" b'you can\'t allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles. both of' b'these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of' b'individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using' b'the current positions but still calculating digitizedlength from the' b'original positions. when we first did this, the triangulation time was' b'prohibitive, so we only did it once. if i were motivated to try and' b'change code that has been working in production mode for years, i' b'*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration. if you have more' b'compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having' b'every point interact with every other point....but first read up on' b'linear solutions to the n-body problem.' b'' b'there are lots of papers in the last years of siggraph proceedings on' b'springs, constraints, and energy calculations which are relevant. the' b'above method is described, in more or less detail in:' b'' b'author="sloan, jr., kenneth r. and david meyers and christine a.~curcio",' b'title="reconstruction and display of the retina",' b'booktitle="proceedings: graphics interface vision interface b'address="vancouver, canada",' b'pages="385--389",' b'month="may",' b'year=1986 b'' b'author="christine a.~curcio and kenneth r.~sloan and david meyers",' b'title="computer methods for sampling, reconstruction, display, and' b'analysis of retinal whole mounts",' b'number="tr b'institution="department of computer science, university of washington",' b'address="seattle, wa",' b'month="december",' b'year=1987 b'' b'author="christine a.~curcio and kenneth r.~sloan and david meyers",' b'title="computer methods for sampling, reconstruction, display, and' b'analysis of retinal whole mounts",' b'journal="vision research",' b'volume=29,' b'number=5,' b'pages="529--540",' b'year=1989 b'' b'' b'--' b'kenneth sloan computer and information sciences' b'(205) 115a campbell hall, uab station' b'(205) fax birmingham, al
