b'' b'| [stuff deleted]' b'|' b'henrik] country. turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the' b'henrik] karabakh conflict with azerbaijan.' b'' b'bm] gimme a break. capital letters, or not, the above is pure nonsense. it' b'bm] seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'again, armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves. what do' b'want them to do. lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them.' b'' b'bm] while hoping that turkey will stay out. stop and think for a moment,' b"bm] will you? armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it" b'bm] is a part of it.' b'' b'armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged' b'training azeris militarily to fight against karabakhi-armenians.' b'' b'henrik] the karabakhi-armenians who have lived in their homeland for b'henrik] years (cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin) are the' b'henrik] ones directly involved in the conflict. they are defending' b'henrik] themselves against azeri aggression.' b'' b"bm] huh? you didn't expect azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them" b'bm] within their borders?' b'' b'well, history is sad. remember, those are relocated azeris into' b'the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime.' b'' b'henrik] at last, i hope that the u.s. insists that turkey stay out of the' b'henrik] karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never' b'henrik] occur again.' b'' b"bm] you're not playing with a full deck, are you? where would turkey invade?" b'' b'it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped' b'into armenia if she could.' b'' b'bm] are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header' b'bm] in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun?' b'' b'absolutely not i am merely trying to emphasize that in many' b'cases, history repeats itself.' b'' b'bm] yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes' b'bm] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring' b"bm] the parties to the negotiating table. that's hard to do when armenians" b'bm] are attacking azeri towns.' b'' b'so, let me understand in plain words what you are saying; turkey' b'wants a peaceful end to this conflict. not b'' b'i will believe it when i see it.' b'' b'now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a gun pointing' b'to your head do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef(fat chance)?' b'do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku all the' b'barberian acts especially against mothers and their children. i mean' b'burning people alive b'' b'bm] armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the' b'bm] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that' b"bm] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's" b'bm] going to cause incessant skirmishes.' b'' b'armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic. they are' b'not asking much. they simply want to get back what was taken away' b'from them and given to azeris by stalin.' b'' b'bm] think of or years down the line both of the newly independent' b'bm] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe' b'bm] the other out. these people will be neighbors, would it not be better' b'bm] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?' b'' b"don't get me wrong. i also want peaceful solution to the" b'conflict. but until azeris realize that, the armenians in' b'karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion.' b'' b'bm] if you belong to the armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes' b'bm] your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of' b'bm] their blood and future.' b'' b'again, you are taking different turns. armenia has no intension' b'to grab any land from azerbaijan. the armenians in karabakh' b'are simply defending themselves until a solution is set.' b'' b"bm] it's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize" b'bm] craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled. the armenians' b'bm] in armenia and n-k will be there, with the same people you seem to hate' b"bm] as their neighbors, for maybe years more. the sooner there's peace in" b"bm] the region the better it is for them and everyone else. i'd push for" b'bm] compromise if i were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading' b'bm] inflammatory half-truths.' b'' b'it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative. i am absolutely' b'for it. but, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,' b'you will be wiped out. such as the case in the era of of' b'the armenian massacres.'
