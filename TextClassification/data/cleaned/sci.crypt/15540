b'' b'actually, i am *completely* baffled by why dorothy denning has chosen' b'to throw away her academic respectability like this. it looks to me' b'like a *major* career limiting move. there can be very few people' b"who know what she's been saying who take her seriously any more." b'' b"i'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles" b"i've seen, arguing for increased government intervention and" b'management is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually' b'means more high paying jobs for academics as "advisors"). also' b'consider that it looks like denning has some decent nsa government' b'connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that' b'wants more government funding and work tossed their way.' b'' b'despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably' b'outweighs the drawbacks. and there are a whole bunch of people who' b"think the whole thing is just peachy keen. if it's only going to be" b'used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well' b'it must be good. :p' b'--' b'truth is hard to find and harder to obscure.'
