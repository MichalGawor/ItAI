b'' b'' b' hi,' b' i am buying a quantum lps240at mb hardisk and is deciding a' b' hdd/fdd controller. is 32-bit vl-bus hdd/fdd controller faster' b' than bit ide hdd/fdd controller card?' b'' b'no, vl-bus ide is no faster than isa ide. the ide interface is' b'fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the isa bus, and if' b"you hook it to vl-bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two," b'meaning isa speed.' b'' b"it's not true. ide bus uses signals which has similar name and same" b'meaning to the counterpart of isa bus but its (ide bus) signal timing' b"doesn't have to be same to isa signal timing. my vl-ide bus card has" b'a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3mb/sec up to 8.3mb/' b'sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as b'*milion* byte/sec and *milion* byte/sec respectively). you' b'cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3mb/sec on the isa bus.' b'' b' i hear that' b' the vl bus controller is slower than a ide controller?' b'' b"on the other hand, i wouldn't expect it to be *slower*..." b'--' b'os/2 will do for me until amigados for the comes along...' b'' b'ken nakata' b'--' b'/* i apologize if there are incorrect, rude, and/or impolite expressions in' b'this mail or post. they are not intended. please consider that english is a' b"second language for me and i don't have full understanding of certain words" b'or each nuance of a phrase. thank you. ken nakata, cis student, njit
