b'' b'me, too... rbi are a worthless stat. of course, so is stolen bases because' b'sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. and of' b'course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases,' b'so batting average, slugging and obp out, too. hmmm... i guess homers would' b'not count then, either.' b'my point? rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. and no stat (or lack' b'of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. maybe no stat can tell me,' b'either, but some people are... i just know it!!! b'' b'but why would you want to use rbi? rbi is an attempt to measure is some' b'combination of clutch hitting and power hitting. if you believe in' b'clutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with risp. if you want to' b'see how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average.' b'' b'in terms of evaluating players, rbi totals are better than nothing. but' b'why use them when so many better stats are out there?' b'' b'--' b'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++' b'go tigers, lions, pistons, red wings and wolverines b'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++'
