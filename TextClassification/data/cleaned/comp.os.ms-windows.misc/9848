b'' b'' b'i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse.com (was using b'i think, but switched to to see if it was any better). vertical motion' b"is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can't click" b'on something because my mouse jumps around. i can be moving the mouse to' b'the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly' b'for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump' b'again (maybe this time to the left about inch!). this is crazy! i have' b'never had so much trouble with a mouse before. anyone have any solutions?' b'' b'does microsoft think they are what everyone should be? just venting steam!' b'' b'i had the same problem. at first, i thought it was the video driver and' b'made sure i had the most current drivers, because the problem was most' b"evident at svga resolution modes. it didn't help and after a bit of" b'experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard vga' b'resolution mode. it was just much less noticeable.' b'' b'my mouse was an older ms serial version i bought second hand in it' b'worked just fine in dos and dos based graphic applications. on the' b'guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, i borrowed' b'a new mouse (a ms bus model) and tried it. that solved the problem.' b'so, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer' b'one.' b'' b'---' b'sean eckton' b'computer support representative' b'college of fine arts and communications' b'' b'd-406 hfac' b'brigham young university' b'provo, ut b'(801)378-3292' b'' b'--' b'signoff' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b"comprehensive technologies int'l inc., arlington, va" b'=============================================================================='
