b'' b'' b'i am trying to build and use imake (x11r4) on an ibm rs/6000 running aix v3.2.' b'i am having the following problems.' b'' b"(1) many of my imakefile's have contructs like" b'/**/#this is a makefile' b'at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c' b'preprocessor and into the makefile. most of the c preprocessors that' b'i have used will not treat such a as appearing at the start of the' b'line. thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the' b'start of a directive.' b'' b'however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol' b'as the start of a directive. the cpp fails when it determines' b'that "this" is not a known directive. i have temporarily hacked my' b'imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better' b'fix.' b'' b'(2) several imakefiles use as a parameter to a macro when a particular' b'use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter. the aix cpp' b'gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok.' b'' b'if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, i would appreciate' b'information about on your solutions.
