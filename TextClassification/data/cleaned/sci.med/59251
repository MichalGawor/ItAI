b'' b" would anyone out there in 'net-land' happen to have an" b' authentic, sure-fire way of making this great sauce that' b" is used to adorn gyro's and souvlaki?" b'' b" i'm not sure of the exact recipe, but i'm sure acidophilus is one of" b' the major ingredients. b'' b"it's plain yoghurt with grated cucumber and coriander (other spices are" b'sometimes used). some people use half yoghurt and half mayonaise.' b'' b'in the kind i have made i used a lite sour cream instead of yogurt. may not' b'be as good for you, but i prefer the taste. a few small bits of cuke in' b'addition to the grated cuke may also finish the sauce off nicely.' b'' b'' b'---' b'trh'
