b'' b'i recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash' b'system as a technical report at cwi. being a phd-student at david' b"chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research" b'in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.' b'' b'the report is called cs-r9323.ps.z, contains pages, and can be' b'retrieved from' b'' b'ftp.cwi.nl b'' b'from the directory pub/cwireports/aa.' b'the postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.' b'' b'====================================================================' b'abstract (from coverpage): we present a new off-line electronic cash' b'system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which' b'little use has been made in literature thus far. our system is the' b'first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms. using the' b'representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are' b'introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and' b'payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier' b'systems. as a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in' b'both computation and communication complexity than any such system' b'proposed previously.' b'' b'another important aspect of our system concerns its provability.' b'contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be' b'mathematically proven to a very great extent. specifically, if we' b'make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the' b'ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the' b'diffie-hellman problem.' b'' b'our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in' b'previously known systems. in our opinion the most interesting of these' b'is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be' b'incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has' b'the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the' b'first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender' b'after the fact. in particular, it can be incorporated even under the' b'most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,' b'which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.' b'another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have' b'negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by' b'a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that' b'previous solutions lack entirely. furthermore, the basic cash system' b'can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while' b'retaining its computational efficiency.' b'====================================================================' b'' b'cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!' b'' b'i made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as' b'possible. nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to' b'me and i will try to reply as good as i can. any comments are also' b'welcome!' b'' b'stefan brands,' b'--------------------------------------------------------' b'cwi, kruislaan sj amsterdam, the netherlands'
