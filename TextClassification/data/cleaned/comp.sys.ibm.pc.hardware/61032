b'' b'' b"well, i've installed dos in three different systems, with and without" b'stacker; a friend installed it in two other systems, both with stacker.' b'' b'not a single problem. (except perhaps some minor bugs with config.sys' b'menus)' b'' b"he's right ya know. i've helped to install dos on about computers now," b'mine included. on one, he bought the stacker to doublespace converter,' b'and it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter).' b'' b"in other cases, i've run the doublespace installation without a problem" b'when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.' b'seems to work for me.' b'' b'ofcourse, we did not, repeat, not run any program called "install"' b'or "setup" or "a very sophisticated ai auto-configuring setup' b'installation program that will think for you and do what you never wanted to' b'do but couldn\'t stop it from doing"' b'' b"well, i ran the normal setup thing and it worked fine for whatever that's" b'worth.' b'' b'also, dblspace is crap. it writes about slower than stacker, reads about' b'20% slower, and compresses about less. all tests were made on the same' b'computer with the same disk, no cache, and the same (big) files were used.' b'' b"couldn't agree more. on my i don't miss the speed. it's still" b'faster than a normal disk read would be. as for the less compression,' b"i've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin" b'load before anything else. with stacker, any changes to your config.sys' b'or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.' b'' b"personally, i'm waiting for stacker to come out and implement those" b'hooks and stuff. plus, the defrag that comes with dos is okay, but i' b'much prefer compress from pc-tools for sheer bells and whistles. plus,' b'defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.' b'' b"but, dos is quite good; reformat disks? i honestly don't understand why" b'you had to do this.' b'' b'ditto.' b'' b'koberg'
