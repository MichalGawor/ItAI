b'' b'i guess the cryptowranglers read this group too. but of' b'course i knew that because it is so easy to do. there is' b'not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes' b"every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the" b'colligation of data about (maybe your name is here).' b'' b'maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted' b'posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private' b'key. for example at the coming up cypherpunks meeting, a private' b'key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out' b'by a moderator. minutes, followup comments to other participants,' b'and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use' b'of the people who attended. communiques intended by the group for' b'non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key' b'but otherwises not encrypted.' b'' b'starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining' b'mailing lists is better for several reasons. first, it would be' b'easier to archive for people who might join a group "late" and' b'who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis' b'to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled;' b'three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize' b'available privacy measures on the internet.' b'' b'and it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such' b'keys it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.' b'' b'we could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to judge william' b'sessions or admiral studeman to save them the time of having it' b'collected for them.' b'' b'' b'--' b''
