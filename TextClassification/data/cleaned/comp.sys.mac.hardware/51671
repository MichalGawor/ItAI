b'' b'' b'hello all!' b'' b"for few past days i've been fighting to get my nec multisync 3d" b'(predecessor of 3fg) to work properly with the internal video of mac' b'iivi.' b'' b"with a vga-adapter (as described in dale adams' posting about quadra" b'video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not' b'to prevent any action on screen to be visible clear.' b'' b'but because the scanrates stuff of 3d are well enough for emulating' b'apple rgb, i first made an adapter, then got one fron the local' b'distributor of nec.' b'with both adapters i can get a picure, which looks excellent most of' b'the time or every now and then.' b'but with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows' b'etc.) there are major interferences in sync. the picture either tilts' b'sideways or scrables up totally. even when it is clear, there are some' b'"spiky" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing' b'pull-downs etc.' b'with the self-made adapter, almost identical to the vga one, only' b'sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a' b'picture clear enough to shut down from menu...' b'with the adapter from nec, everything is well most of the time, but' b'sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely' b'lost. but not nearly as often as with the self-made one.' b'' b'i know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but' b"with the one provided by nec... where's the source of this interference?" b'' b"i'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and i hope that you can," b'at least someone (please try figure out what could be the best pin' b'assignment for nec 3d.' b'i am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and' b'isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be' b'arranged, especially syncs and groundings.' b'' b'yes, i have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works' b'perfectly well with all pc graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and' b'also atari 71hz monochrome, which i am using now with it.' b'' b'here are the pinouts stuff:' b'' b'15 pin mini d-sub (nec 3d)\t\t15 pin d-sub (mac, at least quadra)' b'' b'1 red video\t\t\t\t1 red gnd' b'2 green video\t\t\t\t2 red video' b'3 blue video\t\t\t\t3 composite sync' b'4 gnd\t\t\t\t\t4 sense b'5 gnd\t\t\t\t\t5 green video' b'6 red gnd\t\t\t\t6 green gnd' b'7 green gnd\t\t\t\t7 sense b'8 blue gnd\t\t\t\t8 nc' b'9 nc\t\t\t\t\t9 blue video' b'10 gnd\t\t\t\t\t10 sense b'11 gnd\t\t\t\t\t11 c.sync v.sync gnd' b'12 nc\t\t\t\t\t12 v.sync' b'13 h.sync\t\t\t\t13 blue gnd' b'14 v.sync\t\t\t\t14 h.sync gnd' b'15 nc\t\t\t\t\t15 h.sync' b'shell gnd\t\t\t\tshell gnd' b'' b'' b'' b'connection suggested by apple for vga/svga, sense pins changed to' b'emulate apple with multisync (my self-made adapter)' b'' b'multisync (15pin mini d-sub)\tmac (15pin d-sub)' b'' b'1 b'2 b'3 b'6 b'7 b'8 b'10 b'13 b'14 b'4 (sense0) grounded to (sync gnd)' b'' b'' b'connection measured from an adapter to make nec 3fg/4fg' b'emulate apple (adapter provided by nec representative)' b'' b'nec mini) \tmac b'' b'1 b'2 b'3 b'4 shell gnd, b'5 same as above' b'6 same...' b'7 same...' b'8 same...' b'10 same...' b'11 same...' b'13 b'14 not connected! b'' b'' b'well, i am waiting for your solutions...' b'' b'and thanks!' b'' b'--' b'jartsu'
