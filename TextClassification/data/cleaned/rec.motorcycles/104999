b'' b'a few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was' b'an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to' b'be available thru bmw. the idea was that the tape would look' b'black in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to' b'headlights. it sounded like a nice way to add nighttime' b'visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.' b'' b'i talked to the local bmw dealer about this. i was told that the' b'only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being' b"used in a coming line of bmw clothing (rainsuits). he wasn't aware" b'of anything regarding self applied tape.' b'' b'has anyone come across this from bmw or any other source?' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'---' b'steve bunis, sun microsystems ***dod #0795***\t93-st1100' b'itasca, il\t ***ama #682049***\t78-kz650' b''
