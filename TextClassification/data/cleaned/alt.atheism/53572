b'' b' as i have stated on a parallel thread, i am not an anarchist, nor is' b' islam anarchist. therefore the uk should have control over itself.' b' however, this does not change the fact that it is possible for citizens' b' of the uk residing within the uk to be in violation of islamic law.' b'' b"this is an interesting notion and one i'm scared of. in my" b"case i'm a finnish citizen, i live in usa, and i have to conform" b'to the us laws. however, the finnish government is not actively' b"checking out what i'm doing in this country, in other words checking" b'out if i conform to the finnish laws.' b'' b"however, islamic law seems to be a 'curse' that is following you" b'everywhere in the world. shades of eh?' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
