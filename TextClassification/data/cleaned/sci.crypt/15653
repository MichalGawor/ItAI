b'' b'' b' interestingly enough, in designing the escrow, we may want to use some' b' rather unusual technology, such as sealed boxes of paper, or' b' destructive read memory, rather than typical computer databases, which' b' is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys.' b'' b'' b'to me, a larger problem is that once disclosed, your keys could be used' b'to decrypt any previously recorded conversations. i gather that from this' b'proposal a warrant would be required to get the keys, but not to collect' b'conversations! consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptively' b'all encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (and' b'not necessarily "legitimate" targets), then arranges for some unrelated' b'incident that can trigger a warrant:' b'' b'"your honor, we know that the suspect has received calls from noted' b'crime figure bugsy butthead [said calls arranged by the agency] and we must' b'therefore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect, in a' b'sensitive govt post, is corrupt."' b'' b'i suppose that it is conceivable that there are session keys involved' b"somewhere, but that doesn't seem likely; if there are, why wouldn't the" b'technical overview mention them when it goes to such details as the number' b'of bits held by each escrow authority?' b'' b'this scheme is full of holes, and stinks to high heaven.' b'' b'-mel' b'' b'________________________________________________________________________' b'| beckman software engineering compuserve: b'| ventura, ca voice/fax: b'|______________________________|_______________________________________|' b'"you can observe a lot just by watching." -yogi bera'
