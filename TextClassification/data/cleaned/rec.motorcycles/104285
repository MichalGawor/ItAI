b'' b'' b'' b'watch out. often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means' b'that they were or are looking to steal the bike. in my case, i' b'had a faded cover stolen off a bmw r100rs that was stashed in an' b'apartment carport and not visible from the street. they evidently' b"decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to" b'steal a honda hurricane parked in the next apartment building.' b'a neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.' b'' b'' b'i know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the' b"things that is really good about bmw bikes. from all accounts i've" b'heard practically no one steals bmws. probably it is similar for moto' b'guzzis and other relative "exotics" since there isn\'t a large demand' b'for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. it seems' b'that the most stolen bikes are harleys and 600cc jap sport bikes.' b'' b'--' b'encore computer corp, kildaire farm rd, cary, nc usa' b'919-481-3730/voice \t\t\t\t919-481-3868/fax'
