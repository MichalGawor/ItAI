b'' b'' b'| what bothers me most is why people who have no religious affiliation' b'| continue to persecute jews? why this hatred of jews? the majority of' b"| people who persecute jews are not christians (i can't speak for all" b'| christians and there are bound to be a few who are on the anti-semitism' b'| bandwagon.)' b'|' b'| do you even have anecdotal evidence to back this up? the most blatent' b'| persecution of the jews in history was of course done by the nazis before' b'| and during world war ii, a predominately lutheran crowd. sure, many' b'| muslims in the middle east consider the israelites to be a thorn in their' b'| side, but the most of the modern persecution of jews has been at the hands' b"| of christians (at least as far as i'm aware)." b'|' b'| rob lanphier' b'' b"do you consider neo-nazis and white supremists to be christian? i'd hardly" b'classify them as christian. do they follow the teachings of christ? love' b'one another. love your neighbour as yourself. love your enemies. is jesus' b'christ their lord and saviour? by the persecution of jews, they are violating' b'all the precepts of what christ died for. they are in direct violation of' b'the teachings of christ. even jesus who was crucified by the jewish leaders' b'of that time, loved his enemies by asking the father for forgiveness of their' b'sins. i am a christian and i bear no animosity towards jews or any one else.' b'the enemy is satan, not our fellow man.' b'' b'god be with you,' b'' b'malcolm lee
