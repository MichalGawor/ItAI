b'' b'hi,' b'i was reading through "the spaceflight handbook" and somewhere in' b'there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them' b'when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to' b'the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. the magnitude of such accelerations he' b'estimated to be on the order of 700g. he also says that this is may not' b'be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published' b'in have already withstood accelerations of 45g. all this is very' b"long-winded but here's my question finally are 45g accelerations in" b'fact humanly tolerable? with the aid of any mechanical devices of' b'course. if these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?' b'can this be extended to larger accelerations?' b'' b'thanks is advance...' b'-amruth laxman' b''
