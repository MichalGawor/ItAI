(for instance gts look" b' pretty mean in a rearview mirror at night with the foglights on... b" there have been plenty of times when i've broken up a pack that a" b' second-in-line hyundai has been behind for miles... you just need to' b' know how to get their attention...' b'' b'' b"i'd like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers. if they see you," b'they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle' b'finger extended. because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane' b'ahead.' b'' b'' b'' b'h.h.m.' b''
