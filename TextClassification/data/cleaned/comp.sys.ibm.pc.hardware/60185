b'' b'i have a 486dx33 isa system with meg. i am using a diamond speedstar hicolor' b'video card with meg vram and a standard ctx 14-in svga monitor. when i am' b'running windows, and i have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping' b'the program manager window), and i close the active application, window erasure' b'is very slow. the part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,' b'very slowly. this also happens when i iconify an application.' b'' b'the hicolor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it' b'does not have an accelerator chip on it. i am running at 800x600x32k. is this' b'slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there' b'something else that is bottlenecking the system that i am unaware of?' b'' b'thanks.' b''
