b'' b'hi,' b'' b"i'm hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science" b'project group. we are doing computer science honours, and our project' b"is to do a 'graphical simulator for a finite state automata'." b'' b'basically, the program must draw a diagram of a fsa from a textual grammar,' b"showing circles for states, and labeled arc's in-between." b'' b'the problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the' b"arc's in-between so that as few arc's as possible cross each other." b'' b'if anyone has any suggestions/algorithms/bug-free ready to compile c code b'that might help us, it would be much appreciated.' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'' b'gregory'
