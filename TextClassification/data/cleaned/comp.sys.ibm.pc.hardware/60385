b'' b'' b'can anyone tell me if this card works with the march os/2 beta?' b'' b' i believe so, since the buslogic cards have proven to be very' b'reliable in os/2 b'' b'the buslogic cards have an os/2 driver that does work with the march b'beta. support for the buslogic cards is not included with os/2 any longer.' b'if you wish to install the beta from the cd/rom, you will need to rem out the' b'adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the buslogic' b'cards when os/2 attempts to use them. (thanks adaptec!)' b'' b'so you add the buslogic drivers to the config.sys on the cd-rom boot disk, and' b'rem out the adaptec drivers.' b'' b"then you install the whole 1st half of the beta.. and it won't work! ibm" b'nicely copies in the adaptec drivers once again. (thanks ibm!) so.. rem out' b'the adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. if you have everything in the' b'right order.. it will work.' b'' b'things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except os/2' b'will try to install the adaptec scsi drivers once again at the end... so.. you' b'are off to more rem statements and more fun.' b'' b'the bt 542bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the adaptec cards that' b'do not come with drivers. the dos drivers work great. this card can easily be' b'configured to work with different sets of i/o ports (and you can use' b'multiple host adapters in one machine) if you get a new card.. it will also be' b'able to support up to gb drives under dos.' b'' b'hope this helps..' b'' b'- dan' b'' b'' b'--' b'******************************************************************************' b'******************************************************************************' b''
