b'' b'can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications' b'besides i.c.c.m.?' b'' b"i've looked everywhere i can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it" b"but nobody shows you how. o'reilly has no examples, iccm has no examples," b"asente swick give no examples in fact most of the books i've looked at," b'if they discuss icc at all, simply give a condensed version of the iccm and' b'then refer you to the iccm. i did find one example of how to use atoms and' b"properties in young's book and five hours after i bought young's book i had" b'my applications talking to each other.' b'' b"i am not sure, however, if thats the best way. i'd like to stay independent" b"of unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go. but within x" b'one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.' b'' b'i need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best' b"for which purpose, and gives examples. without examples it's all just words." b'' b'thanks in advance' b'' b'ross'
