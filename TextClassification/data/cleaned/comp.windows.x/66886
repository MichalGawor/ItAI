b'' b'' b'my impression is that most people use motif because their os vendor' b'supplies it with x (sunos users excluded), and because it is similar in' b'"look and feel" to ms-windows and os/2 pm. personally, i also prefer' b'the "look and feel" of motif (no flames please just an opinion).' b'' b"seeing as motif has been adopted by sun, ibm, hp (can't remeber the" b"other members in the recent announcement), i'm sure you'll see it on" b'virtually every workstation (ie. sun, ibm, hp and dec must make up the' b'**vast** majority of all hardware).' b'' b'' b'i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif, particularly from the' b'point of view of writing and obtaining free software. as the linux and' b'386bsd communities grow, however, i think that motif will lose some of' b'its grip, at least in the non-commercial marketplace.' b'' b'' b'ports of motif to both 386bsd and linux are available for a fee of about' b'$100. this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to' b'redistribute. the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups' b'pertaining to motif has been high.' b'' b'' b'i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial' b'and non-commercial software (ie. you will only get free software using' b'athena or openlook widget sets, and only get commercial software using' b'the motif widget sets).' b'' b'' b"i can't see why. if just about every workstation will come with motif" b'by default and you can buy it for under for the "free" unix' b"platforms, i can't see this causing major problems." b'' b'' b'side note b'---------' b'all the x based code i am writing (and will distribute freely when' b'completed) is based on motif because from a programmatic and also "look' b'and feel" point of view i like it the best (no flames on this one' b'please).' b'' b'' b'' b'bambi' b'' b'/ b'/ senior network programmer' b'/ comms development operation' b'\\____/ australia
