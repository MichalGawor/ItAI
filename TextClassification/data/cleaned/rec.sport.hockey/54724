b'' b'finns had to do their best last night when they played against norway' b'in world champs. after two periods the score was still this game was' b'quite much similar to the first game finland played (against france).' b'the norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. in the third period' b'juha riihij{rvi scored from a rebound, the time was around mins or so.' b'the second goal was scored by kari harila, who shot straight from a faceoff' b'behind the nowwegian goalie. saku koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first' b'point of this tournament. saku koivu played very well througout the game and he' b'was awarded the best player of the game- prize. despite the fact that he is' b'quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater.' b'i think that we will hear from this guy in the future.' b''
