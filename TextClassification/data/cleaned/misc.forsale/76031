b'' b'i recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused sony tcd-d3 dat' b'walkman, having found someone else who has a unit i personally prefer (and am' b"paying more for). however, it's still a heck of a machine for the price it" b"is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it. (it's probably the" b'most popular walkman-style dat machine out there.)' b'' b"here's what he told me:" b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'here is what is included:' b'- tcd-d3 datman.' b'- rca to stereo plug cables. one for analog input, one for' b'analog output.' b'- optical digital i/o cable (one lead for input, one for output).' b'- a copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase. the' b'unit is still under factory warrantee.' b'- ac adaptor/battery charger.' b'- rechargable battery.' b'' b"i paid tax for it so i hope you don't mind if i keep the minute" b'tape it came with (i have some samples on it!).' b'' b"[by the way, he spent at least too much for it, unless he's including an" b'extended warranty, which is advised for dat machines, since it costs about' b'$300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within b'years if you use it a lot.. davisonj]' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b"i'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice." b'send him mail and ask him what he wants.' b'' b"again, i've used the tcd-d3, and i have to say that i can certainly" b"understand why it is as popular as it is. i've been using one for a little" b'while, and although i had some problems with it recently, i should also point' b'out that the particular one i was using had been on the road for two years and' b'had truly been _used_ during that time. (this is the same exact dat machine' b'that was lugged around the u.s. and canada to record the jazz butcher' b'conspiracy for their recent live album.)' b'' b'bryan davis says:' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'i know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels' b'in s.f who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported' b'problem. my problem is that everyone i know already has one.' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b"'nuff said." b'' b"the reason i'm not getting it is that i found someone else selling me a" b"unit that features phono-plug spdif i/o instead of optical (i don't have any" b'optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has' b"some other bells whistles that the tcd-d3 doesn't. (i am also paying more" b'for the alternative.) note that phono-plug-to-optical spdif adapters are' b'available if you absolutely must have one.' b'' b'of course, it has scms. all consumer decks do. (so do sony minidiscs,' b'by the way.)' b'' b'' b'--' b'john davison'
