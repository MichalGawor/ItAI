b'' b': just a thought of mine here:' b': since an on-hook line is aprox 48-50v, and off-hook it usually drops below b': how about an led in series with a zener say around 30v.' b': on-hook led on' b': off-hook led off.' b': would this work? if anyone tries/tried it, please let me know.' b': b": aye, there's the rub if you draw enough current to light an led, the" b": equipment at the phone company will think you've gone off hook." b": in the on-hook state you're not supposed to draw current." b': b': which means you should just use your digital voltmeter. you can use an' b': old vom but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think' b": there's something wrong with the cable." b': b':' b": look guys, what's the problem here? if you want a light that goes on when" b": the 'phone is *off* hook, all you need it to run it in *series* with the" b': line, as i mentioned in my previous post. if you want a light that goes on' b": when the 'phone is *on* hook, all you need is a voltage threshold detector." b'' b"if you're going to do the series diode thing (which is the easiest), just" b"make sure that the led can take the current (i can't recall it off-hand, but" b"it's something like 100ma or more?)" b'' b"and tip when the phone's supposed to ring! even with a simple zener" b'and led setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick. whatever' b"scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200v-rated components on" b'the frontend.' b'' b"also remember that, if i'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm" b'equivalent circuit. any current you draw from the 48v or so gets' b"dropped across that 600ohms. that's fine until you're down to roughly" b'12v, when ma bell considers it to be off-hook. but dropping it that' b'far down is probably a big no-no.' b'' b'the easiest implementation to accomplish the above??' b'' b'tip b'rectifier resistor b'diode b'v b'zener resistor' b'| b'| b'| v led' b'| b'| b'ring b'' b'this is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you' b"get the idea. choose a high-efficiency led so you don't need much" b'current to get it to light up. choose values for the other components' b'as required.' b'' b'aaron' b''
