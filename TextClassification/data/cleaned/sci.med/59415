b'' b'' b'reading through the posts about kirlian (whatever spelling)' b"photography i couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the" b'narrow-minded, "i know it all", "i don\'t believe what i can\'t see or' b'measure" attitude of many people out there.' b'' b'i am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to' b'so-called "paranormal" stuff; but as far as i\'m concerned, it is just' b'as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be' b'quite accepted in our societies without any scientific basis.' b'' b'i am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to' b"something, anything, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame" b'of reference. history shows that many great people, great scientists,' b'were people who kept an open mind and were ridiculed by sceptics.' b'' b'especially the usa should be grateful; after all, columbus did not' b'drop off the edge of the earth.' b'' b'it is one thing to be open-minded about phenomona that have not' b'be demonstrated to be false, and quite another to "believe" in' b'something like krilian photography, where *all* the claimed effects' b'have be demonstrated to be artifacts. there is no longer any reason' b'to adopt a "wait and see" attitude about krilian photography, it' b'has been experimentally shown to be nothing but simple coronal' b'discharge. the "auras" shown by missing leaf parts came from' b'moisture left by the original whole leaf, for example.' b'' b"that's what science is, son." b'' b'---bill vanhorne' b''
