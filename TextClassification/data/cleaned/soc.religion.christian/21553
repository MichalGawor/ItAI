b'' b'paul repeatedly talks about the' b'"thorn" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, but' b'who knows. whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not "compatible"' b'with christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?' b'' b"there is no reason to believe that paul's thorn in the flesh was" b"a sin in his life. that makes little sense in the light of paul'" b'writings taken in totality. he writes of how he presses for the' b'mark, and keeps his body submitted. no doubt paul had to struggle' b'with the flesh just like every christian. paul does associate his' b'thorn with a satanic messenger, and with physical infirmities and tribulation,' b'but not with a sin in his life.' b'' b'link hudson.'
