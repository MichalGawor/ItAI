b'' b'' b'is there a way to wax out a dull finish (minor scrathes)? while' b'"passngering" on my fiance\'s bandit, my hip-pack rubbed against the tail' b'and left a nasty dull finish and teeny scratches. is there a way to get' b'rid of these? buff them out? wax them out?' b'help!' b'' b'' b'car accessory shops here sell stuff called t-cut, which is a very fine' b'cutting paste for paint, and this will remove the dull finish and' b'minor acratches. it will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that' b"you probably don't realise is there, and give your paintwork its original" b'lustre and shine. it can sometimes react badly with metallic paint, though,' b'so try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff. afterwards' b'apply wax polish, and all will be well again.' b'' b"btw don't confuse t-cut with the cutting paste used for grinding in" b"valves...the principle's the same but the coarseness is vastly different..." b'' b'mike' b''
