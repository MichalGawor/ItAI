b'' b'' b'riding up the hill leading to my' b'house, i encountered a liver-and-white springer spaniel (no relation to' b'the springer softail, or the springer spagthorpe, a close relation to' b'the spagthorpe viking).' b'' b'i must have missed the article on the spagthorpe viking. was' b"that the one with the little illuminated dragon's head on the front" b'fender, a style later copied by indian, and the round side covers?' b'' b'[accident deleted]' b'' b"what worries me about the accident is this: i don't think i could have" b'prevented it except by traveling much slower than i was. this is not' b'necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but i was' b'riding around the speed limit.' b'' b'you can forget this line of reasoning. when an animal' b"decides to take you, there's nothing you can do about it. it has" b'something to do with their genetics. i was putting along at a' b'mere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in,' b'just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a' b'fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me! when i saw her jump' b'the fence i went for the gas, since she was about feet ahead' b'of me but a good forty to the side. damn cow literally chased me' b'down and nailed me. no damage to cow, a bent case guard and a' b'severely annoyed rider were the only casualties. if i had my' b"shotgun i'd still be eating steak. nope, if 2200lbs of cow" b"can hit me when i'm actively evading, forget a much more" b'manueverable dog. just run them over.' b'' b"< isu only censors what i read, not what i say. don't blame them. b'< usenet: post to exotic, distant machines. meet exciting, b'< unusual people. and flame them.
