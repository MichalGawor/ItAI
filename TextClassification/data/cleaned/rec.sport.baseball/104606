b'' b'' b" i agree, though i'd also be happy with a stadium that looks" b' like new comiskey. the new park was also made for baseball.' b" unlike three rivers, the vet, riverfront, etc., it's not a" b' football park in which they also play baseball.' b'' b"while we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget shea, which" b'was designed to accommodate both the mets jets. it was the first' b'stadium (i think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be' b'oriented at right angles for baseball in parallel for football.' b'' b'of course, with the jets gone to jersey (and a truly good football' b'stadium), the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where,' b"because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the" b'action. the mets announcers--kiner murphy in particular--have' b'always hyped it as "beautiful shea' b'stadium," a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.' b'' b'jay'
