b'' b'' b"last week's macweek article by ric ford indicated that david ramsey's" b'mac iix has been running nicely with a mac iici rom in it, offering' b'clean 32-bit rom code (liberating his iix from the virtual memory' b"nightmare caused by apple's 32-bit system enabler)." b'' b"[ this would make me a bit suspect of mr. ramsey's qualifications" b'as a self-styled "expert", in fact, when i read about anybody' b'using virtual memory regularly i kind of wonder b'' b'yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer rom (of the' b'correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be' b'prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine' b'type rather than rom trap availability and then draws incorrect' b'conclusions when special-casing especially timing-dependent' b'and driver-related stuff.' b'' b'in this particular case i see no reason to go to the trouble' b'of rom-swapping. the apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but' b'mode32 works just fine with and b'' b'does anyone know of a source for these roms?' b'' b'sure. buy a used iici motherboard. call pre-owned electronics,' b'shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of computer shopper' b'or one of the mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price' b'on a iici rom. everything has a price. if you happen to find' b'somebody who salvaged a iici with a dead motherboard, you might' b'get a decent price. there is probably a market for used mother-' b'boards as well, so they might sell a rom anyway.' b'' b"needless to say, i'm interested in purchasing such a rom. what would" b'be a reasonably price to offer?' b'' b'ask for a quote and then try offering less? pre-owned and' b'shreve have been known to dicker. their ads in various trade' b'magazines often list considerably different prices for the' b'same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.' b'' b"still, i'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading" b'the rom in a iix.' b'--' b'-- chambers street; newark, de
