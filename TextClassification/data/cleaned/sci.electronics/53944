b'' b"does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators i've been seeing" b'all over late-night tv recently? i was wondering if they use forced air, hea' b"or both. if there's heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at" b"my wife would like one and i'm not inclined to pay for a box, a fan" b'and a heater. seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together' b'for just a few bucks. heck, the technology is only what? years old?' b'' b'you can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "the' b'hungry hiker\'s guide to good food," by gretchen mchugh. the heat source' b"is a watt light bulb. basically, it's a vertical wooden box with" b'ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air' b'to flow). the light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are' b'spaced every starting about above the bulb.' b'' b'or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what i do: use' b'your oven. (note i do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may' b'not have a low enough setting). put food to be dried on cookie tins or' b'racks in the oven. set oven to degrees (the lowest setting on my' b"oven if yours goes down to that's probably even better.) stick a" b'wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close' b'the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch this allows' b'for airflow. leave the stuff in the oven for to hours; check it' b'often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator. if you are' b'using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway' b'through.' b'' b"if you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub" b'for this stuff.' b'' b'' b'' b'* slmr i still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.' b'' b'----' b'the ozone hole bbs a private bulletin board service b'3 full service nodes usrobotics 16.8k bps gigs files' b'skydive new orleans! rime network mail hub usenet newsgroups'
