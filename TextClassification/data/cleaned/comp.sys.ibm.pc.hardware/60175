b'' b'while rummaging through a box of old pc parts, i found a half-size' b'board that looks like a comm port board. it was made by forte data systems and' b'has a copyright date of on it. the board provides a male 24-pin connector' b'and has jumpers of pins each, two labelled a b c. i plugged it into my pc' b'and ran advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions each' b'time, but the system did not recognise a comm port.' b'' b'does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it?' b"i could use another comm port if it's free." b'' b'bryan'
