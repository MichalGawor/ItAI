b'' b'' b'' b'|' b'| does anybody reading this group have an actual, honest-to-god' b'| experience with violent crime in the backcountry to tell about?' b'|' b'' b'it was around in the shenandoah valley near woodstock, virginia. me,' b'my wife, a friend, his wife, and his kids were hiking in a totally' b'desolate mountain area. all of a sudden, large rocks began raining down' b'on us. looking up, we saw at least punks gleefully letting loose rocks' b'from what was an obvious stash. they were a couple hundred feet above us.' b'meanwhile, the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and the' b'punks were shrieking with laughter. me and my friend yelled for them to' b'knock it off. they responded that we should "get f***ed!". me and my' b'friend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees above' b'their heads. they ran. with no more pound rocks coming at our heads,' b'we proceeded on our journey.' b'' b'sorry, but me and my friend saw no need to let it evolve to a more' b'"violent" level than we were already experiencing. i guess we should' b'have tried harder to understand and cope with the anger that society' b'had instilled in them and was driving them to do such things. guess' b"that's a cross i'll have to bear." b'' b'brad'
