b'' b' i am using xdm on x11r5 with ow3 and xview3 on sun3s and sparcs running' b' sunos prior to using xdm, i used to set path and other environment' b' variables (like manpath, helppath, arch, etc) in my .login file. with xdm,' b" the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm" b' root-window nor my applications know about these variables.' b'' b'one usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file' b'instead of your login-only one, which is fair enough if you only have a few' b"users who know what they're doing. if you have several hundred users who do" b"what the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best. another is to" b'have your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager' b'and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.' b'' b'our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,' b"it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the" b"rest of the startup scripts. that way the user's usual environment gets set" b'up as normal and inherited by everything. you can find an almost-current copy' b'of our scripts and things in contrib/edinburgh-environment.tar.z, available' b'from the usual places.' b'--' b'george d m ross, department of computer science, university of edinburgh' b'kings buildings, mayfield road, edinburgh, scotland, eh9 3jz'
