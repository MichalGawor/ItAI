b'' b'i feel as if i might be causing some bad karma by doing this, but i just have' b'to know......' b'' b'is the ack man still in organized baseball?' b'' b'\tglad you asked!! the ack-man, and nine of his relatives, are currently' b'impersonating the baltimore orioles pitching staff. personally, i believe' b"that the evil ackers kidnapped the real o's staff, and are currently in the" b'process of impersonating mussina, sutcliffe, mcdonald, olson.' b'' b'no, no no. the ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much' b'like the pod people from planet mars, who can take on any form (the' b'ability remains the same, however). the ack-people have been spotted on' b'many teams to date, but it appears that the orioles staff (mentioned' b'above) and the expos bullpen (barnes, walton, fassero, gardiner and' b'rojas) have been the prime target. apparently john wetteland was roughed' b'up by the ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his' b'system rejected the takeover, and has been on the dl ever since. contact' b'the authorities! this evil plot must be stopped! (the ack-people can' b'keep jack morris and juan guzman, though. i enjoy watching toronto fans' b'suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal b'' b'scot.' b'' b'' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b"scot hughes department of chemical engineering expos in b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
