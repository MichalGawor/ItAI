b'' b'wrote:' b'' b" i just got a copy of tobias' managing your money v9.0. i have quicken b" and it's wonderful for some things, but mym seems to have some features" b" that q6 doesn't. for example, q6 doesn't seem to be able to handle" b' monthly automatic deductions from a checking account (you know, a' b' monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from' b" my checking account). or is there something that i'm not doing right," b' and q6 can actually do that?' b'' b'' b'hi' b'i have never used mym so i can not help you with the comparison of the' b'two products. i am, however, a devoted quicken user, and i can tell you' b'how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions. first' b'use the memorize feature (ctrl-m) to record the recurring transactions.' b'next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions' b'and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly). quicken' b'will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you' b'do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be' b'entered at once. additionally if you are using the bill minder, it will' b'remind you when each transaction group is due. for example, you could have' b'three transaction groups. one for payments at the beginning of the month,' b'middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments. i hope this helps.' b'' b'mike'
