b'' b'' b'i have noticed in framemaker 3.1x on both the sgi and sun platforms' b'that certain dialogs, such as "column layout..." for example, respond' b'to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is not in the dialog' b'window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is' b'pointer.' b'' b'how is this done?' b'' b'i would like to emulate this behavior in my application. it seems a' b'reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard' b'action, the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the' b'user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.' b'' b'alternatively, i\'m open to any suggestions as to what is the "right"' b'way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear, particularly' b"when they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus" b'policy is pointer.' b'' b'allen barnett' b'(whose wife graciously allowed to use her account)'
