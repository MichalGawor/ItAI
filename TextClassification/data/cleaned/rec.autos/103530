b'' b'' b'' b'could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e cd) mentioned in magazines. i understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but' b'what does this mean in the real world. is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the cd reduced from to b'' b"it's pretty complex, and cd isn't the whole story either. cd for cars is" b'usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car. so a large car' b'with a good cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a' b'poorer cd.' b'' b'to calculate drag use this formula:' b'' b'd rho v^2 cd s' b'' b'where d is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),' b'v is the velocity (ft/s), and s is the frontal area (ft^2). note that the' b'pieces called rho v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure' b'(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force).' b'' b'note that power is:' b'' b'p f v' b'' b'where p is power (lbf-ft/s), f is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v' b'is velocity (ft/s).' b'' b'note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting d for' b"force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term. that's why huge increases in power" b'result in little increases in speed. ditto for decreases in cd.' b'' b'so if you have a mph car and reduce cd from to your new top' b'speed is: (sound of trumpet fanfare)' b'' b'101 mph' b'' b'sorry to dissappoint.' b'' b'' b'--' b"al bowers dod alfa ducati hobie kottke 'blad iaido nasa" b'"well goodness sakes...don\'t you know that girls can\'t play guitar?"' b'-mary chapin-carpenter'
