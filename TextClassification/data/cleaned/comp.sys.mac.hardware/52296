b'' b'i bought a stylewriter ii a couple months ago, and lately, when i print' b'something, i notice white lines or "gaps" running through the line being' b"printed. it's almost like the paper is advancing a smidge too far when" b'advancing lines.' b'' b'i replaced the ink cartridge thinking it might be the problem, but the lines' b"are still there. has anyone else noticed this problem? what's the best way to" b'get rid of it?' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'i had a similar problem with my stylewriter i (the original!).' b"have you tried cleaning the print heads? with the swii driver, it's" b'and option in the print dialog box. sometimes i had to do it several' b'times to get the crud out. yes it wastes ink, but it beats those' b'white annoying lines.' b'another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big' b'black box. it can help to get the ink flowing.' b'good luck!' b'' b'beth corbo' b''
