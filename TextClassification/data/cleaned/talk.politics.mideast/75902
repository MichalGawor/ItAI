b'' b'well,i tried not to get involved in this never ending talk,but,man,i really got' b'hot about this bullshit.' b'' b'' b'' b': q: how many occupying israeli soldiers (terrorists) does it' b': take to kill a year old native child?' b': b': a: four' b': b': two fasten his arms, one shoots in the face,' b': and one writes up a false report.' b': b'' b'making stupid and idiot jokes about soliders will not bring anything (not' b'mentioning peace or agreement). i also know several tens of jokes about arabs' b'(palestinians) but i do not post them to usenet (anyway,not to this newsgroup),' b"since i don't think i will achieve any target but making other parts furious,and" b'this is not my target.' b'if this is your target...well...that tells a lot about you.' b'' b'' b': can nick steel provide documentation for this alleged incident b'' b'did you really think he is talking about something realistic?' b'' b'' b': harry.' b'' b': you must be kidding ,this is not a single incident' b': now. this has become a daily life practice in gazza' b': if you mean the killing of children by armed soldiers.' b'' b'yeah,well,sometimes,when cowards put their children and wives in the front line,' b'so their enemy cannot do anything,well,maybe in those cases,you have no better' b'thing to do (to save your life) than shooting. and if parents want their' b'children alive,i think it would be better that before they get out to throw' b'stones/molotov botlles,or when they come to kill soliders,to keep their children' b'in the houses.' b'' b'' b': if you are objecting the number of occupying israeli' b': soldiers (terrorists) or the way they do it then' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^----\\/' b'look in the dictionary at the word "terrorism"! it' b'says: (nu) the use of threats of violence,and violence' b'esp for political purposes.' b'it sounds more like your guys...' b'' b': i caan assure you that they do worse than that. just as' b'' b'yeah? well,i guess you were in there,and you know it all...' b'' b': example children were killed this month of ramadhan' b': two of them by military vehicules. an other similar' b': incident by vehicule was the one of feb ramadhan)' b': where thee military truck on purpose hit a passenger' b'^^^^^^^^^^---\\/' b'where from do you know that it was "on purpose"?' b"personally,i didn't hear about this case,although" b"i don't deny it.but how can anybody,besides the" b'person itself,can say it was "on purpose"?' b'' b': car where the victims were a year girl safa sail' b': bisharat' b': and saamud riyad a weeks old babygirl.( the b': oldd raajij rouhy)' b'' b'yeah,sure.the truck driver looked in the car with his zionist equipment of' b'detecting palestinian children,and then he thought to himself:hey there is a' b"5 year and weeks girls in the car.why won't i make an accident and kill" b'the "enemy"? maximum i will die too in the crash...but what do i care?...' b'' b': b': hakim.' b'' b'actually, if can remember correctly, was it not reported and even on camera' b'some time during the israeli invasion of lebanon, or when the itifada began,' b'that cnn caught regular uniformed israeli soldiers breaking the arms of' b'some arab youngsters in a very professional and brutal manner, (someone' b'please give full details if they can remember). this is one of the few' b'' b"well,it was about years ago ,in the intifada (the fact that you can't" b'remember the time prooves how much do you care about it). i do not think' b'that what the soliders did was correct. but i will not agree that they "were' b'breaking their arms".i saw that film,and,unlike in the usa,it was broadcasted' b'entirely not long ago (in a talk show) and at the end the "arm-broken" guys got' b'up and walked and used their arms very good. they guy who did it was interviewed' b'and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take' b'his orders,and spitted in his face. what ammount of truth exist in this' b"statement i cannot tell you,because i wasn't there. but the guy who did it was" b'in prison,if it makes you any good.' b'' b'occassions on which such a scene has been transmitted to the west and' b'in the usa it caused uproar and was one of the factors that has significantly' b"changed the preception of the israeli army's role in the mid-east." b'' b"no,it didn't. the israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle" b'east.it is still the only human army(as much as an army can be human).to any' b'american who will claim the opposite,i can only remember the cnn broadcasting' b'of the american solider who beat a somalian boy. it was very cruel to see.but' b"i won't say because of this that the american army is cruel." b'' b'' b'so there is proof for you! it is obvious that is a systematic policy of the' b'israelis which must be occurring on a massive scale behind the scenes.' b'' b'some kind of proof! "obvious"? where from? if you say it is behind the scenes,' b'how do you know about it?' b'' b'' b'nadeem' b'' b'' b'' b'i just wanted to show how much garbadge one can say,without knowing anything' b'about what he says,and living a life far away from the place he talks about.' b'' b'_____ __livian__ __segal__ b'*\\ b'***\\ b'|---o---| b'\\ b'\\/***\\/
