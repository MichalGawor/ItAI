b'' b'how can the government tell which encryption method one is using without' b'being able to decode the traffic? i.e., in order to accuse me of using an' b'unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both' b'keys out of escrow, run them against my ciphertext and "draw a blank".' b'' b'i can imagine the ciphertext exhibiting certain statistical' b'characteristics that might give a clue as to the encryption technique' b'used, but not enough to give a handle for diferential cryptoanalysis.' b'however, superencipherment or some other scheme that shapes the percieved' b'properties of my ciphertext could thwart this.'
