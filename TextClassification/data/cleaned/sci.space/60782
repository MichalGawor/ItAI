b'' b'' b'hi all,' b'' b'i really thought that by now i would have seen something' b"about this, but i haven't, so here goes: last night on" b'the evening news, the anchorperson said something to the' b'effect that one of the ssrbs that was recovered after the' b'recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of' b'some sort rattling around apparently inside the case. there' b'was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was' b'found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson' b'did say something about a nasa official commenting that' b'there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the ssrb.' b'' b'has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be' b'better than mine heard anything about this? it seems rather' b'weird.' b''
