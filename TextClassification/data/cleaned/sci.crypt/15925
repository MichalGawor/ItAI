b'' b'i posted an informational request about any electronically available' b'articles on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago. as i' b'mentioned, i was interested, in particular, in des and public-key b"but also wouldn't mind learning about others. as i said, i can read" b'an intro-graduate level text book, having had some mathematics, though' b"not much number-theory per se. i'd like to see the technical details" b'of the mathematics of cryptography, as oppossed to the popularizations' b'of things like _scientific am_ which just say, "then you find a' b'*really* big prime number....".' b'' b'following my request, several people were so kind as to suggest' b'reading-lists, which i hope to get around to. two other people were' b'so *very* kind as to send large documents, which i presume were actual' b"articles (about lines each); but i've stupidly deleted them" b'accidentally before having a chance even to skim them. if they can' b'forgive me for my careless use of file-commands, would the original' b'senders be so kind as to resend? or anyone else who has good' b'crypto-articles at a fairly technical mathematical level? also,' b'ftp-able or gopher-able docs would be nice to know about.' b'' b'yours, lulu...' b'' b'--' b'_/_/_/ this message was brought to you by: postmodern enterprises b'_/_/ the opinions expressed here must be those of my employer... b"_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/ surely you don't think that *i* believe them!
