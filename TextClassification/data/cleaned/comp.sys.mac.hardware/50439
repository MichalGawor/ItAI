b'' b'as i said "i know a multisession cd-rom is necessary if you do more photos..."' b'but what if it is just a writable cd-rom drive and do a second "session"' b'do you need one for that too?' b'' b'if you write a second time to a cd you need to have multi-session capability to' b'read the second session. whether it is photos or just data or whatever.' b'' b'here is a simplified way of looking at it:' b'the first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks. the' b'second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still' b"exists, because you cannot change, only add. so if you put that in a 'normal'" b'drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all' b'data. multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last' b"directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not" b'taking multiple directories into account.' b'' b'lex van sonderen' b'philips interactive media'
