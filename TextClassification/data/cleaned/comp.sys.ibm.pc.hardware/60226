b'' b'hi,' b'' b'i just disassembled my old xt and get disk drives 30m hard drive and a' b'360k floppy drive. my questions are:' b'' b' -can i use these drives as drives d e on my 386sx25 this 386sx25' b' currently has 80m hard drive, 1.2m 1.44m floppy drives.' b'' b' -if i can, what s/w or h/w do i need b'' b'' b'i would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. xt drives' b'usually came in mfm or rll flavors. i bet your 386sx has ide drives. the' b'two are not compatible on the same controller. however, you might be' b'able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386sx. you should be' b'able to plug your 360k drive into your existing 386sx controller (i' b'think). you might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the' b'xt.' b'--' b'interactive systems corporation above does not necessarily reflect' b'resource solutions international that of anyone else.'
