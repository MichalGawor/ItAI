b'' b'i use desqview/x and i think it is great. where it really shines (imho) is' b'to let unix users log into a pc and run dos and windows applications with' b'the display going to their screens.' b"you'll need to get:" b'desqview/x v b'desqview/x v suggested retail' b'desqview/x to other x systems v suggested retail' b'' b'you also must be running a supported network (ftp softwares pctcp,' b'novell lan workplace for dos, sun microsystems pc-nfs, beame and whiteside,' b'wollongong pathway tcpip or hp microsoft lan manager)' b'' b"if you don't have any of this network stuff, quarterdeck will give you a" b'copy of novell tcpip transprot for dos with the network manager.' b'' b'' b'in my opinion, if you want to have other people logging in and running' b"applications at your pc, you'll want to have a with megs of ram." b'also, the xwindows software in desqviewx really seems to like an et b'(tseng labs chipset) based graphics card. personally, i found that things' b'ran better with a scsi drive in the pc than with esdi drives, but that is' b'my experience only' b'' b' good luck and best wishes' b' phil' b'' b'what sort of traffic is generated with the x-calls? i am curious to find' b'out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running' b'dv/x is supporting multiple users (clients) and we require adequate response' b'time. anyone have any ideas b'' b'' b'' b'---' b'__/ george patapis ---------------------pan metron ariston---------- b'__/ p.o.box a792 sydney south --fax b'__/ nsw, australia.-------voice:(02) b'' b''
