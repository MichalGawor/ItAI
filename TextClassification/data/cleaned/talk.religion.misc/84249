b'' b' "christ" is greek for "messiah". "messiah" means "annointed one".' b' "annoint" means "to rub with oil, i.e. to anoint; by impl. to' b' consecrate" the major prophet daniel uses the word "messiah"' b' in daniel chapter b'' b' how "closely" did you analyze the bible? looks as if you didn\'t' b' get past the first word. so was the catalyst to break your faith the' b' "priests" who interpreted the bible for you? did you ever do what' b" the bereans did to paul's teachings in acts b'' b'brian, does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient' b'greek, hebrew and aramaic in order to understand the core of' b'christianity? i hope you are not catholic, because my christian' b'upbringing was based on the teachings of luther, and the one of' b"the core messages was basically that you don't need to know latin" b'in order to learn about salvation.' b'' b'btw, your statement would also eliminate about of all the christians' b'in the world, as well.' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
