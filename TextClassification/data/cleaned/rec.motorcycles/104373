b'' b'mjssecondly, it is the adhesion of the' b'mjstyre on the road, the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the' b'mjs motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and' b"mjsnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. are you seriously" b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'mjssuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster' b'mjsor more competently than you could manage otherwise??' b'' b"edif he's not, i will." b'' b"hey ed, you didn't give me the chance! sheesh!" b'' b'the answer is, absolutely!, as ed so eloquently describes:' b'' b"edput two riders on identical machines. it's the" b"edone who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster. it *may*" b'edbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,' b'edthrough trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.' b'edonly by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'edimprove on that technique (i hold that this applies to any human' b'edendeavor).' b'' b'herein lies the key to this thread:' b'' b'kindly note the difference in the responses. ed (and i) are talking' b'about knowing riding technique, while mike is arguing knowing the physics' b'behind it. it *is* possible to be taught the technique of countersteering' b'(ie: push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way) *without*' b'having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones' b'and such as seen in the parallel thread. that stuff is mainly of interest' b'to techno-motorcycle geeks like the readers of rec.motorcycles b"but doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning c-steering." b"mike doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction. i know people" b"who can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who newton was." b'on the other hand, i know very intelligent, well-educated people who' b'think that you steer a motorcycle by either: leaning, steering' b'a la bicycles, or a combination of and knowledge of physics' b"doesn't get you squat knowledge of technique does!" b'' b'mr. bill'
