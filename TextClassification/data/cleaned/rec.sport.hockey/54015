b'' b"here's one from the mill. the oilers might move to hamilton" b'where porklington can get a free deal.' b'' b'' b'the probability is that the oilers are not going anywhere.' b'' b'pocklington has chosen this moment to make his "last" stand is' b'because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial' b'government is months away from a provincial election...it is' b'the moment when he has maximum power to convince northlands' b'to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price...' b"and it is before the nhl's new collective agreement with" b'the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing.' b'' b'pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.' b'' b'he can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his' b"price if edmonton doesn't." b'' b'edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and' b'surrendered supremacy to calgary, and over the next few years' b'edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks.' b'it will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find' b'a way to lose its hockey team too...because northlands wants' b'to continue to use the oilers to subsidize horse racing.' b'' b'however, in this case, about the long-term financial' b'viability of the oilers, the fact is that pocklington is basically' b'right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke' b'the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars' b'in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack' b'of money.' b'' b'sather has done his job...the oilers are poised to be competitive' b'again very soon (al strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey' b'writers in canada in a post-mortem of the oilers season in' b'the globe and mail recently agrees with me.)' b'' b'gerald'
