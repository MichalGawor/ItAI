b'' b'' b'' b'(eileen bauer) writes:' b' thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness,' b' and weight gain. there is also water retention (possibly around heart),' b' changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.' b'' b'is there any relation between thyroid deficiency and depression?' b'' b'perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic' b'depression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get' b'depressed, but i know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the' b'thyroid that would cause depression. note that weight gain is usually' b'a symptom of both. simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid' b'condition is present.' b'' b"i don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output," b'but i would tend to doubt it. as far as i know clinical depression is' b'caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical' b'imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. a regular' b'everyday depression imho should not cause a chemical imbalance in the' b'body at all.' b'' b'the pituitary bases its secretions of thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh)' b'on the level of circulating thyroxin (there are two types t3 and t4 b'one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in' b'the liver). the ratio of t3 t4 can be affected by a number of other' b'hormones (estrogen, for example). naturally, changing activity of the' b"body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but" b'the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in' b'short order.' b'' b"good sources for info on the thyroid are the merk manual (a physician's" b'reference book although reading it is enough to get one depressed b'and the encyclopedia brittanica (should be available in your local' b'library).' b'' b'i hope this has been of some help.' b'' b'-eileen bauer'
