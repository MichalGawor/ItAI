b'' b'i am considering making a reasonably large application for free' b"distribution (probably copylefted). i am going to use x. now i'm" b'bewildered by the huge number of "standards" that "open systems" has' b'created.' b'' b"i've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment. most of the tools" b'here were produced with the athena widget set, or x intrinsics or xw' b'(??).' b'' b"in my humble opinion, they look like crap. i don't know, however, if" b'this is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste' b'in the programmers.' b'' b'i would like my app to look a little more "sculptured" like mwm. i' b"understand, however, that mwm isn't free like the other tookits." b'' b"i am getting linux, so i will have interviews, but i don't know how it" b"will look. i get the impression andrew is from the fsf, but i don't" b'know what it looks like either.' b'' b'if you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, i would be much' b'obliged. which are free? which are the best? which are portable? which' b'looks nice? which is not a resource hog?' b'' b'also, if you happen to know which are available on linux and/or sun,' b'that would be a big help too.' b'' b'thanks in advance.' b''
