b'' b"i'm considering switching to geico insurance, but have heard that" b'they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim. i was' b'worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim. i have' b'also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident.' b'' b"i'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true." b"has anyone out there with geico made a claim? i'd be interested in" b'hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether' b'you then had trouble renewing your policy.' b'' b"i'm also interested in any good or bad stories about liberty mutual or" b'state farm.' b'' b'geico supports (reads gives to police) laser radars. they have been known' b'to be very picky. no sports cars. no radar detectors (although maryland' b'insurance board over rules this consistantly). no turbos.' b'' b"basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they don't want" b"you. they once told me they wouldn't insure me (perfect record) because of" b'my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance.' b'"we must insure all the cars". i think this rep didn\'t know what she was' b'talking about.' b'' b'geico is cheap. but if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped. i' b'think in most areas two tickets will do it.' b'' b'geico will never see a dime from me if i can help it.' b'' b'state farm. slighty higher than most but very good response. not as picky' b'as geico.' b''
