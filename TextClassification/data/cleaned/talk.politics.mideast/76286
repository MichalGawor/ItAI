b'' b'' b'andy beyer has claimed that the israeli press is a bit biased.' b'but the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the' b'mideast that people who do not read the israeli press simply know' b'nothing about. many of these events are not even mentioned here.' b'i read the israeli press to learn of important events about which' b'you know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media' b'for your information on israel. since i read both american media' b'and israeli media, i can say with absolute certainty that anybody' b'who reliesx exclusively on the american press for knowledge about' b'israel does not have a true picture of what is going on.' b'' b'as to the claim that israeli papers are biased, of course they' b'are. some may lean to the right or the left, just like the media' b'here in america. but they still report events about which people' b'here know nothing. i choose to form my opinions about israel and' b'the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average american' b'who relies exclusively on an american media which does not report' b'on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.' b''
