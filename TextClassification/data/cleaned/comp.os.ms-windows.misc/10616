b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i want a little network for users. all users want to run windows.' b'the most important things i want for the network are: file-sharing,' b'mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem' b'card on one of the computers. we all want to use each others harddisk.' b'' b'my idea was to buy three computers (one 486dx and two 386dx). all' b'three have a 40mb local harddisk, the also has a very large' b'harddisk. all three also have a network card. the is connected to' b'the printers and contains the fax/modem card. and last but not least:' b'workgroups for windows.' b'' b'my questions:' b'- is this possible?' b'- what exactly are the possibilities and advantages of workgroups' b'for windows?' b'- will all the computers be fast enough? behind all three, someone' b'is working.' b'' b'thanks,' b'martijn'
