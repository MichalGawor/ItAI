b'' b'' b"i never thought i'd contribute to a gateway thread, either pro or con, but" b'my spleen could use a little venting. the scenario:' b'' b'1 ordered a dx2/50 w/ ultrastor 34f local bus hd controller' b'2 receive system days after ordering (happy)' b'3 discover ultrastor 14f isa hd controller inside (unhappy)' b'4 call gateway, receive the correct controller in days' b'(getting happier)' b"5 new controller doesn't work (unhappy again)" b'6 call gateway again, get another controller in more days' b'(cooling off, the end is in sight)' b"7 this controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad" b'(very unhappy)' b'' b"gateway's solution: they will order me a new motherboard more days)" b'and have on-site service install it for me.' b'but, i have to take a day off of work because the service people' b"only work m-f. i say, no way i've already blown about hours" b"with this, about of them on hold and i don't have the time or b'to take a day off work. also, my day return period is almost over and' b"i've only been able to use the thin for about minutes. so, the whole" b'thing is going back.' b'i was extremely upset when i began this post because the support rep told me' b'that i would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also' b'the two hard drive controllers they had sent me. fortunately, i just spoke' b'to customer service and they are going to have ups come and pick everything' b'up gratis. the only downside is that now i have to order another computer.' b'' b"i would really like to try gateway again, i'm just very turned off by the" b'prospect of having to try and get through to customer service or tech support' b"again... i think their products are great for the most part, but i'm" b'beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.' b'are other mail order companies as difficult to contact? i know gateway is' b"booming, and for good reason, but i don't know if i can take it again." b'oh well, i feel better now...' b'' b'--' b'-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----' b'| mark devaney hear me now and believe me later b'| georgia institute of technology, atlanta georgia, 30332\t\t
