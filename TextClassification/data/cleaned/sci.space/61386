b'' b'' b'' b'is this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics?' b'just a little speculative thinking folks.' b'' b'pat' b'' b'' b'well pat for once i agree with you and i like your first idea that you had.' b'it probably is the gamma ray signature of the warp transitions of interstellar' b'spacecraft! b'' b'well it makes as much sense as some things. i was at the first gamma ray' b'burst conference here at uah and had great fun watching the discomfiture' b'of many of the gamma ray scientists. much scruitiny was given to the' b'data reductions. i remember one person in particular who passionately declared' b'that the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the' b'phenomena of the smooth sky distribution. (heck it even shoots down the' b'warp transition theory the next conference is soon and i will endeavour' b'to keep in touch with this fun subject.' b'' b'dennis'
