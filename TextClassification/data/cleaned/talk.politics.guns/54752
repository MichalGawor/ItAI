b'' b'' b'well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the' b'compound has been answered. abc aired a report including the tapes' b"from monday. the fbi called within minutes of the fire's breakout." b'unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the waco city limits' b'required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally' b'out to lunch?); the operator desperately called around to local' b'community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. by' b'the time trucks arrived minutes later, the whole complex was aflame' b'and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers' b'and no water supply. the fbi made another call requesting a tank truck,' b'but the waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not' b"have one. though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the" b'line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient' b'equipment and water to make a difference.' b'' b'they even aired a tape of a woman who called waco from georgia' b'asking if anything was being done. civic-minded, but probably' b'irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local' b'calls could get through.' b'' b'abc also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who' b'viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the' b'standard "pool shot"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been' b'started in at least places, and b) must have had an accelerant' b'to spread so fast.' b'' b'neither of these is conclusive proof that the koresh crowd offed' b"themselves more than the fbi offed them, but it's a heck of a lot" b'stronger proof than some of the "theories" floating around the net.' b'' b'score fbi, branch davidians. or is that branch davidians?' b'' b'--' b'| the koresh cult standoff is over may his victims recquiescat in pace b'| b'| (the above is a net.moment of silence)
