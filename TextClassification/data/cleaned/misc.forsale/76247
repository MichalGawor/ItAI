b'' b'' b'hi all' b'' b"i have a korg dvp-1 for sale for shipping. for those who've not" b'had the pleasure:' b'' b"it is a midi controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice" b'processor. what can it do with your voice? it can pitch-shift it (change the' b'notes you sing). it can add harmonies to your singing (up to parts at one' b"time). it can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what" b'you say alone and intelligible. this works well for a "computerized" sounding' b'singer, or robot voice. for those of you who just thought about that, yes b'you can do the voices from robo-cop, and the old elo lead-ins with it, and yes b"i'm a little red-faced to say that i tried those specifically. for an input," b'it takes both: xlr (3-prong mic) and cables. for output, you can have' b'a combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the' b'original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired). it has preset' b'setups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences. it has a couple' b'of light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly. even when we' b"don't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio." b'the manual is included. i never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but' b"it has only gotten studio use from me no roading, so it's not beaten." b'--' b'oooooooo o o steve hitch' b'oo o oo oo my opinions are my own. nobody would want to' b'oooo oo oo take responsibility for them anyway. i will' b"oooooooooooooooooooooooooo eventually hang for them, but i'm happy." b'oooooooo ooo ooo uucp: uunet!sparky!shitch'
