b'' b' hmm, it seems that this is the core of christianity then, you' b' have to feel guilty b'' b" i think i see where you are coming from kent. jesus doesn't view" b' guilt like our modern venacular colors it.' b'' b' "feelings" have nothing to do with guilt. feelings arise from the state of' b' being guilty. feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive. feelings are a' b' reaction from guilt. jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the' b' reaction. let me give you an example:' b'' b' have you ever made a mistake? have you ever lied to someone? even a' b' little white lie? have you ever claimed to know something that you really' b" didn't know? have you ever hated someone? have you ever been selfish?" b' are you guilty of any one of these? the answer is of course, yes. you' b' are guilty. period. that is it what jesus is getting at. no big surprise.' b" feelings do not even enter the picture. consider jesus's use of the word" b' "guilt" as how a court uses it.' b'' b"i've done all those things, and i've regretted it, and i learned" b'a lesson or two. so far an aspirin, a good talk with your wife,' b'or a one week vacation has cured me no need for group therapy' b'or strange religions!' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
