b'' b": i've started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission" b': over fairly decent distances in fairly noisy environments, and have' b': seen a variety of schemes for protecting the rs232 transceivers (and' b": the rest of the circuit) from transients on the serial lines. i'm" b': left wondering what is the best way of doing this? how necessary is' b': it?' b': [stuff deleted]' b': what is the wisdom on this out there?' b':' b': ta,' b':' b': martin.' b':' b':' b'from what i know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route' b'the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). things' b'like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or' b"even lightning strikes are very likely and i don't think you like to see" b'the sight of your computer going up in smoke!
