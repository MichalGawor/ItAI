b'' b'' b'' b'jagr has a higher but francis has had more points. and take it from' b'an informed observer, ronnie francis has had a *much* better season than' b'jaromir jagr. this is not to take anything away from jaro, who had a' b"decent year (although it didn't live up to the expectations of some)." b'' b'bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowman-style' b"player. he plays hard at all times, doesn't disregard his defensive" b'responsibilities and is a good leader. bowman rewarded him be increasing his' b'ice time.' b'' b'jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a "me first" attitude.' b'this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.' b'' b'throughout the year, francis consistently recieved more ice time than' b'jagr. althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject, i am pretty' b'sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis. when' b"you add to that jagr's better rating, i think it becomes evident" b'that jagr had a better season- not that francis had a bad one.' b'' b'gregmeister'
