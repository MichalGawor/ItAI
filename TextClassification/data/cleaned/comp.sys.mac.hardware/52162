b'' b'what is the real story here? can i hook up any pc svga montitor to the' b"centris internal video? do i need to make my own cable if it doesn't not" b'come with one? has apple released a tech note with the pinouts for doing' b'such? the reasoj i ask is that it seems the prices for svga are lower' b'than' b'that of their mac counterparts...' b'' b"first of all, i wouldn't advise wasting your time with apple. they'll" b"treat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers (a personal" b'opinion).' b'' b"the safest thing to do is match the svga monitor's scanning rates with" b"apple's rates. i don't know apple's video scanning rates, but i use the" b"micron xceed 30's rates, as they're a good approximation." b'' b"about cables: you just have to go out to someplace like fry's and get a" b'few mac-vga cables and try them out. i have a viewsonic 5e and i' b'use an nec adaptor. other monitors may use other adaptors. i also have' b'a mac-832x624 adaptor that tricks system into thinking the monitor is an' b'apple i need to readjust the vertical and horizontal sizes but it' b'works fairly well.' b'' b'"just like everything else in life, the right lane ends in half a mile."' b'' b'ravi konchigeri.'
