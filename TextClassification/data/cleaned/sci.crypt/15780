b'' b'absolutely. i just meant that no secure *dedicated* crypto device has' b'ever been given approval. guerrilla underground devices should be well' b"possible with today's high-speed modems (not that i can think of many v32bis" b'modems that are approved either mind you just the overpriced couriers)' b'' b'can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run' b"digital speech down 14.4k? i think it is; i've heard it's not. lets" b'say bit samples. would *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate' b'be usable? if not, how fancy does the compression need to be?' b'' b'it is said that celp vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with' b'some room to spare they turn 64kbit bit samples, 8k samples/sec)' b'into baud. however, dsp is hairy, and i have yet to see actual' b'proof of this in the form of an implementation. i have heard fairly' b'reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a' b"celp implementation that runs on sparcstation 1+'s with some room to" b'spare, but i have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy' b'-- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code' b'without having beaten on it for a very very long time first.' b'' b'dsp experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this' b'problem.' b'' b'--' b'--' b'laissez faire, laissez passer. le monde va de lui meme.'
