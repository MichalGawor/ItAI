b'' b': homosexuals are vicious, screwed-up, often' b': really evil people.' b": i've learned quite a bit in the last two years. evil, vicious," b': dishonest, lying scum is the only way to describe homosexuals.' b': clayton e. cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer my opinions, all mine!' b': i believe that clayton is full of shit. who could believe anyone so biased' b": and so obviously misaligned? if he were the slightest bit open-minded, he wouldn't" b': write such slanted smears. especially to generalize an entire group of people.' b'' b'i would say this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black!' b'' b'' b'really now. why is this the pot calling the kettle black? i am stating' b'that a person who shows a continually biased opinion is close-minded and that' b'his opinion should be ignored. clayton is stating that a group of at least' b'two million american citizens are evil vicious malicious child-molesters.' b'' b'here\'s a hypothetical question... if clayton said something like "all' b'those niggers are really stupid." (please don\'t be offended, i\'m not racist' b"but merely using an example of clayton's malign logic). and then said he" b'read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school, i' b"bet he wouldn't have your support. yet he can claim that all homosexuals are" b'dishonest, evil, lying child molesters without *personally* having a single' b"homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him." b'' b"god created a place for bigots. it's called hell and clayton is going" b'to burn there for a long time. i pray for him to find in his heart the' b'christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers' b'and sisters, because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never' b'be righteous.' b''
