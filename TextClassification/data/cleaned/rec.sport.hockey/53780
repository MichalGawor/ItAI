b'' b'not to mention, mr. francis is an incredibly nice person. over christmas' b'break, a friend of mine had a little xmas gathering. the two of us drove' b"to ron's house. while i stayed in the car out of shyness, my friend went" b'to the door and rang the bell. ron answered and my friend introduced' b'himself. he then proceeded to invite francis to the party. ron declined' b'because he "had to watch his daughter." he then reached out and shook my' b"friend's hand! i know this isn't r.s.b., but i don't think barry bonds" b'would be this polite in this situation.' b'' b'george'
