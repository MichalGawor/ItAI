b'' b' it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as' b'reconditioned at a' b' discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad' b'(still' b' covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.' b'' b'well, sounds like we need some kind of a lemon law on the hardware' b'industry. after all it does sound unfair to me for someone that has' b'paid the price of a new drive for a reconditioned one. what do you' b'guys think?'
