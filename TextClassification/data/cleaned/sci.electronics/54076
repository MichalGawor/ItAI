b'' b'' b'i need to make a power supply that can take input from a' b'cigarette lighter in a car (12v dc) and drive volts' b'at up to amps. i know enough to know that a simple' b"voltage divider with two resistors won't do it right. can" b'such a thing be made from radio-shack-able parts without' b'too much difficulty?' b'' b'jps' b'bf' b'' b"p.s. i've looked for premade things like this at radio shack but" b'none of it seems to go any higher than about 800ma.' b'' b'' b'--' b'joel skelton north avenue trade school, dept. of round things' b'' b'see if radio shack has a national semiconductor adjustable voltage' b'regulator, (national) part number: lm350t or lm350k. these devices are' b'' b'digi-key corp. has these parts, as well as several other useful regulators.' b"if you don't have their catalog, their phone number is: b'' b'i can only guess that you may intend to recharge a vdc nicad battery' b"with this device, and if i'm right, you may want to look through some of the" b'hobbiest books to get various ideas for battery charging circuits, first.' b'' b"if you get stuck, e-mail me your fax number, if you have one, and i'll send" b'you some suggestions or schematics.' b'' b'' b''
