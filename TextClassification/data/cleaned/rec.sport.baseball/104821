b'' b'' b'as the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not' b'batting 4th for the giants behind will clark. barry is such an awesome and' b'consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league. imho, to' b'have williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting' b'4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the' b'giants.'
