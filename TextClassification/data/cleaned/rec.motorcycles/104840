b'' b'hello folks,' b'' b'i\'m very happy with my "new" r80gs. my range is miles on gallons...' b"that's mpg!! surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser. i was expecting" b"something rough. she's a sweet backroad honey. and i can go pretty much" b"anyplace i'd take my mountain bike. as far as shaft effect, it's more a" b'torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion. rev it sitting still' b'(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit. maybe' b"i don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion" b'a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence. okay, here are' b'my questions:' b'' b"1) any recommendations for a home-made fairing? i'd like to keep the" b'wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds' b"(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my" b'vision too much for trail riding. anybody have luck with two-piece' b"detachible fairings? i'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas." b'' b'2) i run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the' b"crash bar. the illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming" b'out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so' b'that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it' b'really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.) combined with the' b"headlamp on high you can see like day. but i've heard that bmw alternators" b"don't crank out too much. do i need to shut down the sidelamp when i'm" b'puttering around in the dirt at low rpm?' b'' b"3) this is embarassing: i'm having trouble starting the bike first thing" b'in the morning. i invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section' b'of the paper, and then she starts right up. is this a zen thing?' b'' b"4) the hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline" b'with alcohol additives... yeah, right. what do you folks due to keep' b'the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol? any' b'particular brands of gas that are best? additives?' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'/-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\' b'| b"| kawi zephyr (erik asphaug) b"| bmw r80gs b'\\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/'
