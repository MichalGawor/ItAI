b'' b'' b'' b' the cheribums are on the ark of the covenant. when god said make no' b' graven image, he was refering to idols, which were created to be worshipped.' b" the ark of the covenant wasn't wrodhipped and only the high priest could" b' enter the holy of holies where it was kept once a year, on the day of' b' atonement.' b'' b'i am not familiar with, or knowledgeable about the original language,' b'but i believe there is a word for "idol" and that the translator' b'would have used the word "idol" instead of "graven image" had' b'the original said "idol." so i think you\'re wrong here, but' b'then again i could be too. i just suggesting a way to determine' b'whether the interpretation you offer is correct.' b'' b'' b'dean kaflowitz'
