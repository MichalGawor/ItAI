b'' b'i watched the game germany-czechs in wc today...and i was astonished about' b'the behaviour of the german audience!' b'the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went' b'grazy! they threw coins, extra pucks and other trash into the rink...is' b'that stupid or what?? i guess the canadian referee (one of the' b"isostar-bros gave the german team a penalty for that, but it didn't help" b'much.' b"i guess the germans just are proud over their nazi-kill-'em-all-everyone-" b'but-us-germans-sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude' b'in every possible sport (remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer)' b'it really pisses me off!' b'i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks, but' b'most of them seem to do...' b'' b'jokke kylmaoja' b''
