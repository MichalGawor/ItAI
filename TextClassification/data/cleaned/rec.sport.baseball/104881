b'' b'} last night, boston red sox win its games of games by beating seattle' b'} roger clemson pitch not so dominate. he walked at least man in' b'} first inns. but valetin and greenwell hit homeruns and red sox prevail.' b'' b'clemens struggled with his control, but was also the "beneficiary"' b'of some pretty shoddy umpiring. but to be fair, most of the walks were' b'early in the game, and he adjusted. he was also helped by (dare i say' b'it?) some pretty good defense by the sox, including rivera playing' b'at second, not his normal position.' b'' b'actually, clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win, considering the sox' b"almost gave up the lead in the bottom of the 7th on mo's error catching" b'a throw-over.' b'' b'} i think that game is must win for red sox in seattle, considering darwin will' b'} faced seattle ace randy johnson tonight.' b'' b'must win? in april?' b"they've already won more games so far than anyone thought they would at this" b"point of the season... i hope people aren't getting too caught up" b"in this streak; it's been fun, but teams have streaks all the time," b'and it is only when they are at the start of the season that they get' b'so much attention.' b'' b'-*-' b'charles'
