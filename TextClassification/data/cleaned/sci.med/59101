b'' b'there is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.' b'' b"there's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and" b'published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics' b"who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used." b'' b"no, there's no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous." b'' b'the "evidence" is identical to the sort of evidence that has been' b'used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases' b'in the past.' b'' b'medicine on the right road. but methinks that some who hold too firmly' b"to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough" b'actually treating patients.' b'' b'i like the implication here. it must not be that the quacks making' b'millions off such "diseases" are biased rather that those who' b"doubt their existence don't understand the real world. it seems" b'easy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same' b'thing.' b'' b'however, i have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple' b'quack diseases rise and fall in popularity. "systemic yeast syndome"' b'seems to be making a resurgence (it had fallen off a few years ago).' b'there will be new such "diseases" i\'m sure with best-selling books' b'and expensive therapies.' b'' b'if anybody, doctors included, said to me to my' b"face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', i cannot guarantee" b'their safety. for their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as' b'far as i am concerned.' b'' b"well this, of course, is convincing. i guess i'd better start diagnosing" b'any illnesses that people want so that i can keep my lips.' b'--' b'david rind'
