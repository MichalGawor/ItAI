b'' b'[discussing the use of irq b'' b'' b'i as a number of poeple in this thread have already written' b"(i can't prove it's true, but i believe it), lpt1 does not" b'actually use irq7, even though that interrupt is supposed to' b'be dedicated to lpt1.' b'' b'to put it a little differently:' b'' b'- irq is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the' b'printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.' b'' b"- dos doesn't monitor irq it uses other means to determine when it's" b'time to send out another byte to the printer.' b'' b'- most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable' b'the use of irq usually by merely breaking the connection between' b'the isa pin and the associated driver. other adapters control the' b'irq line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it' b'in the high-impedence mode.' b'' b'- unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate' b'drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the irq lines' b"rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't" b'assert anything). the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes' b'the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically' b'disconnected by a jumper.' b'' b"(incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold" b'the irq line low when no interrupt is desired. if that were true' b'you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines, and' b"that certainly isn't a requirement.)" b'' b'- non-dos operating systems (os/2, nt various unices or whatever the' b'proper plural of unix might be) require the use of irq for performance' b'reasons.' b'' b'and the sb16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.' b''
