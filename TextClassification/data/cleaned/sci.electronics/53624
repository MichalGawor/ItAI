b'' b'' b"so.. here's my question. it seems to me that i'd have the" b'same electrical circuit if i hooked a jumper from the neutral' b"over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding outlets." b"what's wrong with my reasoning here?" b'' b'may i respectfully suggest you not do this?? the ground is' b'supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest' b"looks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for" b"power and protection. it'd never meet code, and if you now own" b'the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities' b"you don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well..." b'' b'there\'s a "wiring" faq that i think addresses this. i believe' b"an alternative is use of a gfci, but i'm really not sure what" b'current code allows in this area. the gfci senses alternate' b"(unwanted) current paths, and doesn't rely on a specific" b'protective ground wire, at least not beyond the gfci in the' b'protected circuit. gfci breakers are available (but expensive).' b''
