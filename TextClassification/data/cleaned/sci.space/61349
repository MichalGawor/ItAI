b'' b'' b'i assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the' b'event and the 1/r^2 law. so, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume' b'some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits gamma ray propagation),' b'could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic' b'events happening much closer to us? the even distribution could' b'be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays' b'being shorter then the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.' b'' b'i believe the problem with this theory is that we see gamma-ray' b"sources at that energy range and their energy doesn't seem to be" b'significantly absorbed.'
