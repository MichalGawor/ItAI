b'' b'' b' hello' b" i'm considering modernizing some old wiring in my home, and" b' i need a little advice on outlet wiring. several outlets' b" are the old 'two prong' type, without the ground. naturally," b' the wire feeding these outlets is without the ground' b' wire. i noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the' b' with ground, and that on these circuits, the ground' b' wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral (white) wire.' b'' b" so.. here's my question. it seems to me that i'd have the" b' same electrical circuit if i hooked the neutral[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[da jumper from the neutral' b" over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding outlets." b" what's wrong with my reasoning here?" b'' b'first, it will not pass a national electrical code inspection.' b'secondly, the neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire' b"shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition." b'' b'the reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the' b'tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the' b'grounded center-tap the neutral. this gives 120v to neutral(ground) from' b'each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer. so in effect' b'the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------' b'michigan technological university' b'school of technology' b'------------------------------------------------------------------'
