b'' b'' b'ever since the siege at waco started the fbi spokesman has been' b'stressing how unstable and paranoid david koresh was. he stressed how' b'likely it was the the branch davidians would commit mass suicide. he' b'was concerned with the safety of the children.' b'' b'what did the fbi do to defuse the situation, did they try to reassure' b'koresh? did the fbi offer medical assistance to the bd? did the fbi' b'offer them a supply of water when the bd pump stoped working? did the' b'permit koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?' b'' b'what the fbi did was harass the branch davidians as much as possible.' b'they kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their' b'electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears' b'with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept' b'limiting their permitter. the stated goal was to put pressure on' b'david koresh.' b'' b'was the fbi attempting to get koresh to surrender or were they hoping' b'to get koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack' b'the the tanks.' b'' b'it appears that the tactics employed by the fbi did drive koresh over' b'the edge. the blame for the deaths should be shared by both the' b'federal experts whose tactics drove koresh over the edge and the fools' b'at the atf who planed the raid.' b'' b'stupidity and incompetence of the batf and the fbi leadership have' b'resulted in the needless death of innocent people.' b'' b'if every thing had gone as planned people would be alive today.' b'instead the atf screwed up and caused the death of incompetent' b'law enforcement can kill you!' b'' b'' b'--' b'rod anderson n0nzo the only acceptable substitute' b'boulder, co for brains is silence.' b'satellite n0nzo on ao-16
