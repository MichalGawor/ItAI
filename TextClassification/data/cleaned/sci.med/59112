b'' b'my girlfriend just started taking imitrex for her migraine headaches. her' b'neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound' b'headaches due to daily doses of analgesics. she stopped taking all' b'analgesics and caffine as of last thursday the weekend was pretty' b'bad, but she made it through with the help of imitrex about every hours.' b'her third injection of imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on' b'friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick. skin' b'was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain. it subsided' b'in an hour or so. since then, she has been taking imitrex as needed to' b'control the pain. immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain' b'for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains. a friend' b'of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of imitrex because it had caused' b'heart attacks in several people. apparently the mild chest pains were' b'common in these other people prior to there attacks. is this just rumor?' b'has anyone else heard of these symptoms? my girlfriend also has mitral' b'valve prolapse.' b'' b"opinions are mine or others but definately not mda's!" b'mcdonnell douglas aerospace, huntington beach, california, usa'
