b'' b'' b' b' a while ago i posted a note asking for specs on the quadra and opinions on' b' the q700 upgrade of a iici vs. an accelerator card. so far no responsed that' b" i've noticed. please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade" b' paths: cost, efficiency, pros/cons, etc.. thanks!' b'' b' complete q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent' b' copy of macworld or macuser. my foggy memory suggests that the most relevant' b' comparison factors vis-a-vis a iici are as follows:' b'' b' mhz b" mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower" b' than q style machines for sure).' b' ethertalk card on-board' b' audio in/out' b' mb ram on motherboard' b' simm slots' b' nubus slots.' b' more flexible build-in video than the ci. uses vram.' b'' b" in comparison, a iici with an accelerator won't give you" b' audio or ethernet or the same video options.' b' with a accelerator, cpu performance can be comparable but i' b' think it ends up costing more.' b'' b' greg dudek' b'' b'actually, an accelerator such as the daystar mhz is cheaper than' b'upgrading to a q700 mhz). the accelerator costs about whereas' b'the upgrade costs (just quoted from my dealer). however the q700' b'upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to b'with bit depth and up to at bit depth (with additional vram). it' b'also has a scsi port capable of a much faster throughput than the ci, which' b'makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.' b'' b"if the improved video and scsi features are important to you, you're" b'better off getting the q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an' b'accelerator.' b'' b'paul'
