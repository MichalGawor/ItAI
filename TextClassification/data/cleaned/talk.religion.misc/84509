b'' b"i wasn't sure if this was the right newsgroup to post this to, but i guess" b'the misc is there for a reason. here goes... i am getting married in june to' b'a devout (wisconsin synod) lutheran. i would classify myself as a strong' b'agnostic/weak athiest. this has been a a subject of many discussions between' b"us and is really our only real obstacle. we don't have any real difficulties" b'with the religious differences yet, but i expect they will pop up when we have' b'children. i have agreed to raise the' b'children "nominally" lutheran. that is, lutheran traditions, but trying to' b'keep an open mind. i am not sure if this is even possible though. i feel that' b'that the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open mind.' b'' b"anyway, i guess i'll get on with my question. is anyone in the same" b"situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this? we've" b'taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting' b"anything get bottled up inside. sometimes i get the feeling we're making this" b'much bigger than it actually is. any comments would be greatly appreciated.' b"also, please e-mail responses since i don't get a chance to read this group" b'often. b'' b'paul'
