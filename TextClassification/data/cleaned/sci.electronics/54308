b'' b'' b'i designed and built hardware in that would output a logic level (from' b'a tone detector) upon detecting a microwatt led feet away.' b'used a motorola mrd360, biased linearly in a dc-feedback loop to servo out' b'variations in sunlight (and 60hz from lights). used no lenses.' b'' b'allen sullivan' b'' b'i would be interested in knowing more about the sensing hardware. what did' b'you use for the detector? could you detect the angle of location, or did' b'the system simply respond to the presence of the transmitter in the sensors' b'field of view?'
