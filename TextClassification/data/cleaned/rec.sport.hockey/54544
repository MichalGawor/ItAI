b'' b'' b' one last point, darryl sutter is getting badly out coached by bob berry. the' b' madder darryl gets the more he reminds me of brian. the hawks are' b" quickly loosing thier focus, i don't think the blues will win in but you" b' never know' b'' b'not to sutter bash or anything since i idolized them as players....' b'you sure would think the sutters would learn something about burning out their' b'teams in the regular season.....just too much intensity during the regular' b'season. i earlier posted a note about brian and got to thinking after i read' b'this item.....gee both sutters won their divisions and now both have lost' b'home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the' b'playoffs. kind of makes you wonder.......' b'' b'bottom line....man it is great to be smoking the warthawks!!!!!' b'agreed jim.....this has been damn sweet, so far. about the only thing' b'that comes close to this is shutting up all the maple laugh fans....detroit' b'has completely kicked their asses so far. but, i will stick with the' b'blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far.' b'' b'stuart esrock bowling green state u. "go you blues!!!"'
