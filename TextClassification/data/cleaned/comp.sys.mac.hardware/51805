b'' b"| i don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your" b'| message, but i definitely had scsi problems between my' b'| q700 and my venerable jasmine megadrive cartridge' b'| drives. my solution was to get silverlining. none of' b'| the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives;' b'| in fact the only loop that worked was the "macintosh' b'| software" loop (whatever that means).' b'|' b'| i doubt this is a quadra-specific problem. i had to get' b'| rid of my "venerable" bernoulli last year (with enough' b'| cartridges purchased at each to make the whole thing' b'| worth more than my whole computer the tech support guys' b'| at ocean microsystems suggested that some third-party drivers' b"| might fix the problem in my case the cartridges wouldn't" b'| format/mount/partition for a/ux.' b'' b'all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my' b'mac plus and my powerbook it was for this reason i assumed' b'the problem had something to do with the quadra. even with the' b'quadra, they mostly worked ok. the problem occurred when i ejected' b'a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes' b'saying "this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware"' b'even though there was no cartridge in the drive.' b'' b'--mark' b''
