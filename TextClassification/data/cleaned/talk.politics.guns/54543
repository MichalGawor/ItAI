b'' b'according to wnci fm radio this morning, dayton, ohio is operating a' b'gun "buy back". they are giving for every functional gun turned in.' b'they ran out of money in one day, and are now passing out vouchers of' b'some sort. they are looking for more funds to keep operating. another' b'media-event brought to you by hci.' b'' b'is there something similar pro-gun people can do for example, pay b'to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm sounds a bit' b'tacky, but hey, whatever works.' b'--' b'' b'here are a few ideas:' b'' b'1) a free library card so they can look up the fbi' b'uniform crime report which shows how good hci is' b'at lying through their teeth,' b'' b'2) a free rtd transit pass which will allow anti-gunners' b'to tour south central los angeles and convince' b"people living there that they don't need guns to protect" b'themselves because the police will do it for them' b"(don't lose the pass, you'll need it to get out)," b'' b'3) a free bus ride to vermont, which has almost no gun' b'control and, curiously enough, almost no crime either,' b'' b'4) a free calculator, since anti-gunners have heretofore' b'been unable to figure out what a small percentage of' b'the guns owned in america are used to commit violent crime.' b'' b'--------------------------------------------------------------' b'lee gaucher nra my opinions.' b'--------------------------------------------------------------' b''
