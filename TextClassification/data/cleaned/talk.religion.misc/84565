b'' b" |probably not. but then, i don't pack heavy weaponry with intent to use it." b' please cite your evidence that he was intending to use it.' b" well, he would be pretty stupid not to, i mean what's the use of spending" b" thousands of on something you won't use? (sorry if i'm stepping on the toes" b' of any members of some "rifle-association" here...). rifles bought for' b' hunting, i can understand, rifles bought for killing people, or for "just' b' keeping" i cannot.' b' just for the record, i am myself a collector of medieval armour weaponry,' b" and i don't just have it hanging around, i use it... (obviously, only in" b' fencing practice with friends...)' b'' b"well, let me see if i can explain it. it's similar to collecting coins," b'or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model' b'trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about' b'everything is collected). in all cases, you might consider it something' b'of an aberration; i mean, what purpose does it serve? not much really;' b"it's just a hobby. the collector yearns for diversity (not much use in" b'having two of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical' b'significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance' b'(this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first' b'one to do it this way), rarity, and so on.' b'' b'some people use their collections, other people do not. as you state, you' b'use your collection. in one sense, this diminishes the value of your' b'collection as the items suffer wear and exposure. in another sense, it' b'can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection. some people collect' b'firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms' b"they collect. it's just personal preference." b'' b"oops, 'personal preference' i guess we're not supposed to have that any" b'more, are we?' b'' b'j.baker.' b''
