b'' b'' b" i'd like to echo these sentiments. this is the worst coverage i can" b' ever remember seeing on cbc. as soon as the game ends, i can count to b" and by that time, they've signed off the air. no post game interviews," b" no updating of late scores, nothin'. tsn is really putting cbc to" b' shame. i only hope the later round coverage improves, i mean, who' b' really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey.' b'' b' my b' darren' b'' b"this was a concession to mansbridge and cbc news, they argued that if you're" b'going to play havoc with the schedule, you should at least make sure that' b'prime time is aired as soon as possible. news got a commitment that the' b'post-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to ptn within' b'one minute or so of the game ending.' b'' b'as for the earlier comments about cbc being "ontariocentric" frankly' b'the no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the west cant see' b"the leafs and people in central canada can't see the jets game. the" b"reason for the decision was cbc's feeling they couldn't sell advertising" b'for six hours of hockey in one night.' b'' b'as for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people. cbc always gets' b'plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b' centre for marine geology, dalhousie university, halifax, n.s., canada' b'| people who wonder where this generation is going should remind themselves' b'|' b'| where it came from in the first place.' b'|'
