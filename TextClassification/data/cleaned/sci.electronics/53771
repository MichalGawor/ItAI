b'' b'i am in the midst of designing a project which requires two motors and an led' b"illuminator driven with pulse-width modulation. i'm using the and" b'i understand that the -fb version has a programmable counter array that can' b'essentially be set and forgotten to do the pwm. the problems is, that variant' b'is difficult to come by. i need two or three of the d prefix (ceramic window)' b'version for development, and then lots of the p prefix (plastic otp) for later' b"production. i've tried avnet, arrow, and pioneer. they (might) have them, but" b"i'm looking for samples at this point, and they're not too willing to provide" b'them. i would buy them, but these vendors have minimums.' b'' b'any help is appreciated.' b'' b'================================================================================' b'[ mark e. levy, fermilab b'[ hepnet/span: fnald::levy (vms!) b'================================================================================'
