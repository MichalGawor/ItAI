b'' b'' b'' b'hi there,' b'' b'i was wondering if anyone knew if john wetteland was put on the dl again' b'after his first 15-day period was up? i read in the usa today sports' b'section that he is on for "surgery to repair broken toe", and was' b'wondering if that was new. i thought he was just letting it heal.' b'' b'another question, is derek lilliquist the main closer for the indians now' b'that olin is gone. i need to know cause i need to find a reliever to' b'replace wetteland and so far lilliquist is doing ok. any information on' b'either of the players would be greatly appreciated. thank you for your' b'time.' b'' b'' b'ryan robin.' b'' b'___________________________________________________________' b'' b'[==================] texas rangers in b'[==================] jose canseco for mvp.' b'[==] b'[==] ryan n. robin' b'[==] weatherford hall' b'[==] corvallis, or.' b'[==] b'[==]' b'[========]' b'___________________________________________________________'
