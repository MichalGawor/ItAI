b'' b'|' b"| so, you are saying that it isn't possible for an instinctive act" b'| to be moral one?' b'| b'| i like to think that many things are possible. explain to me' b'| how instinctive acts can be moral acts, and i am happy to listen.' b'|' b'| for example, if it were instinctive not to murder...' b'' b'then not murdering would have no moral significance, since there' b'would be nothing voluntary about it.' b'' b'|' b'| that is, in order for an act to be an act of morality,' b'| the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard' b'| it?' b'| b'| weaker than that. there must be the possibility that the' b"| organism it's not just people we are talking about can" b'| consider alternatives.' b'|' b'| so, only intelligent beings can be moral, even if the bahavior of other' b'| beings mimics theirs?' b'' b'you are starting to get the point. mimicry is not necessarily the' b'same as the action being imitated. a parrot saying "pretty polly"' b"isn't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly." b'' b'| and, how much emphasis do you place on intelligence?' b'' b'see above.' b'' b'| animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily, but' b"| they don't." b'' b'they do. i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly' b'this, but you seem to have a very short memory.' b'' b"| are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because" b"| most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do?" b'' b"i'm saying:" b'' b'"there must be the possibility that the organism it\'s not' b'just people we are talking about can consider alternatives."' b'' b"it's right there in the posting you are replying to." b'' b'jon.'
