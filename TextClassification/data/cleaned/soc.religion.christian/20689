b'' b'...' b'i think christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is' b'ever disproved. b'' b" didn't paul write that if the resurrection is not true, we are the" b' biggest fools of all? however, whether you believe in christ or not,' b' his teachings (e.g. love your brotherman as yourself), even if only' b' followed at a secular level, could do a great deal to alleviate some of' b' the problems we see today in the world. even when i was a rabid atheist' b" i couldn't deny that." b'' b' jeff johnson' b'' b'we also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been' b'wrecked on our world because of christians who were certain they were' b'following christ. from captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict' b"obedience to the gensis command to subdue the earth, to nazi's who have" b'"justly"' b'punished the jews for the killing christ (as well as the other progroms), the' b'innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with "you shall not allow a' b'witch to live", the moslems who were killed in the crusades, the god-fearing' b'men destroyed by the inquistion. the religious wars in spain, france, england,' b'etc. christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss' b'of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the' b'instructions therein, was unquestionable. there is much to grieve.' b'' b'randy'
