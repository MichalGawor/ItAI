b'' b'' b'hi,' b'' b"\ti'm having a problem with amipro when writing equations. if the" b'equation extends past a certain point on a line, the whole thing disappears.' b'if i then try to delete the equation or cursor beyond the equation, ami' b'goes nuts. the line counter at the bottom of the screen increments' b'repeatedly and the only way out is to ctrl-atl-del. if i have been' b'unfortunate enough to save a document with one of these screwed up' b'equations, the document is basically trashed. (although i have been' b'able to fix them by going into an ascii editor and deleteing large' b'chunks of the document)' b'' b'\thas anyone else experienced this? does lotus know about it' b'and or have a patch???????.' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'' b'kurt' b'' b'i contacted lotus about this problem today. it has been reported previously' b'and there is a fix. apparantly the problem only occurs when tab characters' b'are used immediately preceding the equation frame. the work around when' b'equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one' b'preceding tab and use space to align the frame (or use set frame where' b'placed w/no text wrap around). unforutnately, once the page run-on has' b'occured you are hosed. so the moral of the story is use only space characters' b'to align equation frames.' b'' b'hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this' b'problem.' b'' b'kurt' b''
