b'' b'' b'a friend is heavily into midi and is using a quadra (maybe with' b'all but one nubus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video' b'card. he reports bit video is too slow for good real-time display of' b'what he needs to see. he also reports that the built-in video is even' b"worse. he's not a mac guru, and i haven't seen the system, so this is" b'about all i know.' b'' b'i suspect that his nubus is heavily loaded, and think improvements might' b'come from a switch to an accelerated pds slot video card. does this' b'sound right? who makes a pds accelerated video card for the quadra thats' b'worth looking at? any other suggestions? thanks in advance!' b'--' b'snail: the mitre corporation, nasa road one, houston, texas
