b'' b'peir-yuan yeh asks:' b'' b'i wonder if the ot is not exactly like jewish history. are they the' b'same or part of them are the same? how about torah? are the first five' b'books of ot as the same as torah?????' b'' b'yes, yes, and yes. jewish history as recorded in the old testament and' b'as shown by archaeology are the same. kings, revivals, temples, and all.' b'' b'the torah, as far as i know, is the five books of moses. then come the' b'prophets (all the prophets, plus joshua, judges, samuel, kings)' b'and the writings (psalms, proverbs, lamentations, ruth, esther, ezra,' b'nehemiah, ecclesiates, song of songs, chronicles, job).' b'' b'and the veracity of isaiah, which you quoted to your moslem friend is' b'quite well known. a complete manuscript exists that dates back to past' b'200 bc, and is kept in a museum in israel. it was found among the dead' b'sea scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the' b'old testament, as they date back to around the time of christ, whereas' b'before, the oldest complete manuscript in hebrew was from around ad.' b'' b'your moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so. if jesus' b'was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been god, for only' b'the death of god could atone for the sins of all humanity. and as' b'isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called "the mighty god." and if he' b'was god, then he must have rose, for as st. paul wrote, it was not' b'possible that death could hold him. and if jesus rose from the dead,' b'your moslem friend would have little reason to be a moslem. which is' b'why he denies the authenticity of the old testament.' b'' b'andy byler'
