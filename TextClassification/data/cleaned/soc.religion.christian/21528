b'' b'we chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define' b'our own christianity. we see in parts. if you see something that i do' b'not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on' b'your belief!' b'' b'it is important if christianity is being damaged by it. if' b'people who "speak in tongues" make claims that they are' b'miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of' b'the holy spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply' b'making noises, it damages all christians, since many who are' b'not christians do not distinguish between the various sects.' b'' b'the more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simply' b'uncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the one' b'that should be used by those who make use of this practice.' b'' b'i agree with the point that "charismatic" practices like this' b'can lead to forms of worship which are more about the' b'worshipper showing off than genuine praise for god; one of the' b'things jesus warned us about.' b'' b'matthew huntbach'
