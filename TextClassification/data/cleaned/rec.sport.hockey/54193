b'' b'i have been to all isles/caps tilts at the crap centre this year, all isles' b'wins and there is no justification for vukota and pilon to play for the isles.' b"vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! he couldn't hit a" b'bull in the ass with a banjo!! al must remember a few years back when mick' b'scored goals in one period against the caps in a isles win. i was there' b"and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. wake-up al!!! years later he's" b"gotten worse. he's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting" b'stupid/senseless penalties. i think he would make a good police officier!!!' b'' b"as for pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. he either" b'makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck' b"towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. he can't" b'stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. he either falls down or' b'committs a penalty. call up somebody from capital district al!!!!!' b'' b'as far as the playoffs, the isles are as difficult to figure out as the caps.' b'two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. they should meet in the first' b'round. the isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they' b"should play well against jersey tonite. it'll probably be another tight 1-goal" b'game as the last games hve been for the isles. i wish when the get a lead' b'they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive' b'shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. al must understand he' b"can't do with this team what he did with the isles. maybe al should got" b'to. where is bobby nystrom?? clark gilles?? john tonelli?? these are the kind' b'of young minds we need behing the bench!! fire al!!!!' b'' b'john scialdone' b'' b'**********when your ship comes in, first man takes the sail********************' b'' b''
