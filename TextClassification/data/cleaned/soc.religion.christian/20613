b'' b'i have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of' b"christ's resurrection." b'' b'first the scriptural quotations:' b'' b'this sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified,' b'if not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive. most' b'of these quotations are of people who do beleive. people who would' b'try to justify their own positions.' b'' b'second the logical proof:' b'' b'quoted text...' b'' b'date: apr gmt' b'' b'[much deleted]' b'' b' in nearly centuries, no body has ever been' b" produced to refute jesus' assertion that he" b' *would indeed* rise from the dead.' b'' b' the probability of being able to perpetrate such' b' a hoax successfully upon the entire world for' b' nearly centuries is astronomically negative!' b' b'...end quoted text' b'' b'the period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger' b'does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered. in fact' b'the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.' b'' b'finally:' b'' b'there is no proof of the resurrection of christ, except in our spirits' b"communion with his, and the father's. it is a matter of faith, belief" b'without logical proof. incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for' b'rational western man, myself included.' b'' b'i hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a' b"rejection of the resurrection's occurance. i beleive, but i wanted to point" b'out the weakness of logical proofs.'
