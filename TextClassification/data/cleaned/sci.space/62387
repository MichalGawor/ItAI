b'' b'this "reverse the polarity!" crap always bugged the hell out of me, too,' b'until i found an actual, live, real-life example of it working! i quote' b'from aviation week and space technology for july page b'' b'\the [colonel charles f. stirling, speaking of the problem of' b'\tfuel bubble formation in titan aerojet lr87 engines] said' b"\tengineers at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory had run into" b'\tthe same problem and suggested that the air force look at the' b'\teffect of aerozene decomposition. the fix, now flown three' b'\ttimes without incident, was to reverse the inlet and outlet' b'\tportions of the hot gas cooler.' b'' b'! once again, life imitates art.' b'' b'how about the discussion of the sts tether experiment. ran forward,' b"it would suck energy from the earth's magnetic field, while trivially" b'slowing the shuttle. it could also have run backward if they ran' b'electricity through the tether the other way, it would have trivially' b'propelled the shuttle faster.' b'' b"but an even better example comes to mind. there's this electronics guy," b'someone like craig anderton or don lancaster. ten years ago he wrote about' b'an invention of his. he could take a light-detector, run current through' b'it at about a hundred times its rating, and it would glow. he got legal' b'rights to this design of a combination "fiber optic emitter/receiver". this' b"turned out to be the basic unit of att's (i think) plan to bring brazil's" b'communications system into the 21st century. (the article was mostly about' b'his legal wranglings with the company that eventually got him well-compensated' b'for his invention.)' b'' b'tombaker' b"(yes that's my real name)" b"(my employer's opinion's are not my own.)" b'(i am self-employed)'
