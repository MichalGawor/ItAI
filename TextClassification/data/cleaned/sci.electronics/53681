b'' b'i am making a search for a cad program that does a decent job' b'of making schematic drawings. the program needs to be in' b'ms-dos, windows if possible.' b'' b'what i want the cad program to do is to draw diagrams by' b'dragging elements onto the screen, and in this the elements' b'needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ics (case with pins).' b'it also needs to have provision for adding legends to the' b'components as well as their values. in other words i want to' b'produce quality drawings. printout would be to either pin' b'dot-matrix and/or laser printer.' b'' b'if you know of such a cad program that is of reasonable cost,' b'please respond.' b'' b'fred w. culpepper' b'old dominion university (retired)' b'---'
