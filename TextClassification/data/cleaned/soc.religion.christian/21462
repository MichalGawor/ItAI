b'' b'just an observation- although the bodily assumption has no basis in' b'the bible, carl jung declared it to be one of the most important pronouncements' b'of the church in recent years, in that it implied the inclusion of the' b'feminine into the godhead.' b'' b'jung may have said that, but he was in no way speaking for the' b'catholic church. the dogma of the assumption in no way means mary is' b'considered to be god or part of "the godhead." therefore it implies no' b'such thing about the feminine in general.' b'' b"also jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was" b'announced "out of the blue." this also is incorrect, as dogma is only' b'the formulation of what has always been part of tradition. this dogma' b'has always been believed, but was not formally defined until the' b'assumption was declared as an _ex cathedra_ statement.' b'' b'-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-' b'steve creps, indiana university'
