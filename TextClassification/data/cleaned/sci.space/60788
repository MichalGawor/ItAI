b'' b' there was a science fiction movie sometime ago (i do not remember its' b' name) about a planet in the same orbit of earth but hidden behind the' b' sun so it could never be visible from earth.' b'' b'this was known as *journey to the far side of the sun* in the united' b'states and as *doppelganger* in the u.k. it was produced by the great' b'team of gerry and sylvia anderson (whose science was usually a bit' b'better than this). it may have been their first production using live' b'actors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows,' b'such as *supercar*, *stingray*, and *thunderbirds*. later, they went' b'on to do more live-action sf series: *ufo* and *space: b'' b'the astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, vtol' b'airliners, and mighty portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to' b'look at.' b'' b'bill higgins, beam jockey in a churchyard in the valley' b'fermi national accelerator laboratory where the myrtle doth entwine' b'span/hepnet: 43011::higgins
