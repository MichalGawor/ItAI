b'' b"well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a jay fan the thing i feared" b'worst has happened. the yanks sent down williams g and are going to start' b'williams b in cf.' b'i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation, which is' b"much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought they'd throw" b'out their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". granted, witt' b'"might" be good, but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters' b'up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has' b'experience.' b'the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the' b'jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their' b'pitching staff.' b'the orioles should also be there in the end.....' b'' b'gord niguma' b'(to salvage the season,' b'let jj olerud win mvp)'
