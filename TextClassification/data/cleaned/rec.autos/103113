b'' b'joni ciarletta writes' b' my honda accord just hit the magic mile mark and now' b' all sorts of things are beginning to go bad. the latest problem' b' i am experiencing is with my brakes. they still stop the' b' car fine, but once i am stopped completely, my brake pedal' b' will sink another or inches all by itself. if feels really' b' strange, and i am worried my brakes will quit working one of' b' these days.' b'' b' i checked my brake fluid, and the reservoir was full, but the' b' fluid itself looked really dirty (like dirty oil). i called' b' my mechanic and he told me i need a new brake master cylinder,' b' which will cost me a whopping b'' b"you are not alone. my honda accord with miles on it started" b'showing the same behavior.' b'' b'i replaced the brake master cylinder myself. it took about an hour and cost' b'about sure beats paying to have someone else do it! if i wanted to' b'rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would' b'have cost only to for the rebuild kit.' b'' b'the honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to. two bolts attach it to the' b'engine compartment. two brake lines enter the master cylinder. the tricky' b'part was that the brake lines were stuck tight. my craftsmen open end wrench' b'rounded off the bolt heads! i had to use vise grips to loosen those suckers.' b'wow! best invention since sliced bread. after that it was very easy. bolt' b'the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.' b'' b'this is quite easy even for a beginner. my local auto parts store had a repair' b'manual for the honda accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake' b'cylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.'
