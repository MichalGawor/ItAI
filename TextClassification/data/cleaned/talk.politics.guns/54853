b'' b"ok... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you" b'know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion.' b'you see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed' b'individuals are rushing your front door. will you a) defend yourself and family' b'against this attack b) realize "oh, only the batf would enter like that, so i' b'better surrender" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do' b'what they would like? you have chosen a), and discover that the people you' b'defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your' b'door waiting for you to surrender. you have learned that they intend to' b'charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that' b'you can safely surrender at any time. then they start using psychological' b'warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up' b'and will receive a fair trial. some weeks into this standoff, you are still' b'holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using' b'tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks. yet they claim that' b'you can safely surrender at any time. while you patiently wait out this latest' b'round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as' b'cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through' b'the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created' b'by the tanks. only of your followers make it.' b'' b'i am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate. i am disagreeing with' b'the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to' b'surrender to agents of the federal government after another federal agency' b'committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted' b'search warrant.' b'' b'look at how the texas rangers view the batf. look at the fbi statements' b'regarding the batf actions. from all apparent sources, the fbi blundered' b'trying to clean up the mess made by the batf, resulting in an accidental fire' b"which killed most of the bd's who were still in the compound, and are now" b'playing cya. the batf committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of' b'texas ng resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses' b"by accusing the bd's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been" b'held off in their assault.' b'' b'--' b'********************************************************************************' b'james s. cochrane when in danger, or in doubt, run in this space' b'********************************************************************************'
