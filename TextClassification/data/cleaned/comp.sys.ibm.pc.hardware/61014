b'' b'that is for my wife. i just purchased a viewsonic for myself, and am' b'looking for a graphics card to drive it. i want 70hz refresh,' b'and would really like it to handle my cd-roms. i tried the orchid p9000,' b'which did neither of those things (though robert at wietek did say that the' b'70hz was possible if i modifed the driver data base). so my thoughts go back' b'to hercules. they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the' b'graphite around the end of march. i have heard precisely zero about it since' b'then. does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities' b'(and price) it has?' b'' b'hmm your cd-rom program must be using some oddball vga modes.' b'' b'i think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when' b"it is released though it'll be in limited quantities, i think they" b'have quite a back order right now (the megs version will come out' b'a bit later).' b'' b'since you have a viewsonic (i think it has a 78khz horizontal' b"frequency right?), you're gonna love the megs version. it can" b'do 1280x1024x256 at 75hz, 1152x900x256 at 80hz, 1024x768x256 at 90hz(!),' b'1024x768x65536 at 75hz. it can also do 640x480x16 mil. and' b"800x600x16 bit at 90hz, too bad i don't have such a high bandwidth" b'monitor like yours (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,' b"otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)" b'' b'if you want more info. about the coming graphite vl, you should' b'go to the ibm hardware section on compuserve (ibmhw), in the' b"video sig. there're several hercules reps there that are very" b'helpful.' b'' b'+----------------------------------------------------------------+' b'stephen lau, elec. engineering, univ. of hawaii' b"don't have my own account until grad. school starts (autumn b'+ death to fm synthesis! go gus! b''
