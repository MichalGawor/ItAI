b'' b'following christ. from captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict' b"obedience to the gensis command to subdue the earth, to nazi's who have" b'"justly" punished the jews for the killing christ' b'' b'it is funny how this one little quote from genesis is treated' b'by certain anti-christians as if christians have been given a' b'firm command to destroy the earth. you could prove almost' b'anything by taking little quotes out of context from the bible' b"- it's a big book, you know. i doubt you could find a single" b'case of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically' b'because teh perpetrator was motivated by a christian belief.' b'' b'as for the nazis, they were motivated by german nationalism,' b'not by christianity. in fact they despised christianity as a' b'weak pacifist religion, and were much more keen on pagan' b'glorification of strength and warfare. they killed the jews' b'because they were not germans, not because they were' b'"christ-killers" they were just as keen on killing the other' b'non-german ethnic minority, the romanies or gypsies.' b'' b'matthew huntbach'
