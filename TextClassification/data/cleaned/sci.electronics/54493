b'' b'i was a bit surprised that the manual for my fluke-87 multimeter' b'suggests applying wd-40 to the test lead sockets, especially the' b'current range socket. the intention is to prevent the' b'test-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper from going off when there' b'is no test lead in that socket.' b'' b"the manual is a bit vague, but i think i'd apply the wd-40 to a" b'swab, then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly' b'from the can.' b'' b'speaking of said meters: i compared the against the 8060a that' b"i've had on my bench for almost years. it has been five years" b'since the 8060a has been calibrated. on the dc scale, they agree' b'within mv. ac scale is within about mv. the would be' b'just about the perfect portable meter if it had the db scale; i' b"didn't feel it was worth the extra for a second since i" b"don't use db all that much in my work." b'' b'--' b'bill mayhew neoucom computer services department' b'rootstown, oh usa phone:
