b'' b'' b'\tmy feeling on baptism is this: parents baptize their baby so that the' b'\tbaby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original' b'\tsin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death.' b'' b'you are right, michael.' b'' b'in john jesus says, "amen, amen, i say to you, no one can enter the' b'kingdom of god without being born of water and spirit." that\'s really what' b"he said, and he meant it. that verse is the definition of baptism. i don't" b'have the law book in front of me, but there is a canon law that urges' b'parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very' b'reason that you state.' b'' b'' b'--' b'randal lee nicholas mandock' b'catechist'
