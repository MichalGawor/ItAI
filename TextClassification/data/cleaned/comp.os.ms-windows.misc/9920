b'' b'i installed the s/w for my ati graphics card, and it bashed my windows' b'logo files. when i start windows now, it has the logo instead of' b'the logo.' b'i thought the files that controlled this were' b'\\windows\\system\\vgalogo.rle' b'\\windows\\system\\vgalogo.lgo' b"i restored these files, but it didn't change the logo. anyone know what" b'the correct files are?' b'' b"for a vga card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them" b'back and expect it to work. you have to create a new win.com file. try' b'the command (you will have to worry about what directories each file is in' b"since i don't know your setup):" b'' b'copy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle win.com' b'' b'(i grabbed this from _supercharging windows_ by judd robbins--great book)' b'this is also how you can put your own logo into the windows startup screen.' b'an rle file is just a specially compressed bmp file.' b'' b'hope this helps' b'--'
