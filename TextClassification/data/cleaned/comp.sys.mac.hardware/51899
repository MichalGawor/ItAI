b'' b'question for those familiar with quadra vram:' b'' b'i put 256k vram simms in my quadra (in the slots closest to the' b'ram simm slots) and i got no results whatsoever. i have been told that' b'the built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on' b'a macintosh color display. however, the monitors control panel still' b'lists 8bit colors) as the highest possible.' b'' b'the q700 will only do 8bit or 24bit color. if you want the higher' b'color depth, it\'s 2mb\'s of vram altogether for a monitor up to b'' b'for a monitor, you can get 8bit max.' b'' b'hope this answers your questions.' b'' b'james wang.'
