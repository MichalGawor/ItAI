b'' b'not necessarily. if the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due' b'to the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate.' b'in fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of' b'meat with little effort. medical examiners tend not to like cleaning up' b'such scenes.' b'' b'as such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from a' b'magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and' b'thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the' b'time of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for the' b'evidence. texas rangers are not pathologists.' b'' b'p.vasilion' b'' b'this is quite corect, but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy' b'will show virtually no deformation, ie a hollow point probably would not' b'expand, an fmj would be "pristene". also the bullets will not be marked' b"with the lands ang grooves of a barrel, because they didn't come out of" b'one. a good pathologist should be able to notice this right away.' b'' b"let us hope that the me's that handle these bodies are more competent" b"then the ones who did jfk's body." b'' b'jag' b'' b"speaking of me's. the fbi said the fire victims were found face-up" b'<fire victims, apparently, are usually found face down' b'suggesting they died prior to the fire. the me says, in a word,' b'bullshit, the victims were face down. the fbi says they sent a body' b'of a victim that was shot, supposedly by bd guards, the me' b'says, in a word, bullshit, the body showed no evidence of gunshot' b'wounds. can the atf/fbi tell the difference between cya and truth?' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'|*clinton*gore*cia*fbi*dea*assassinate*bomb*wod*bor*atf*irs*resist*nsa* b'|*christian*god*satan*apocalypse*zog*nazi*socialist*communist*explosive*|' b'+*fundamentalist*revolution*nsc*federal reserve*constitution*gold*fema*
