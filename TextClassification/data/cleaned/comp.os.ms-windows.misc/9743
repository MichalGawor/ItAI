b'' b'hi. my last question for the year. i have a mail-order no-name notebook' b'with meg ram. i never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when' b'running desqview, but win3.1 and w4w2.0 constantly crash on me, most' b'commonly citing a "memory parity error." the only thing i can do is turn' b'off and re-boot. my cmos ticks off counts all the memory every startup,' b'and there is never a problem with this either.' b'' b'could it be a bug in my windows copy instead of the hardware? i remember' b'having some disk error problems when installing it.' b'' b'' b'is there any change i could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of' b'this happening (i think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but both' b'crash frequently nonetheless)' b'' b'i know this is a pain, but please answer by email because my home account' b"doesn't have rn. and i will stop asking questions now. thank you."
