b'' b'hello,' b'' b'recently i noticed there is a directory named "diskimage" in my disk. i didn\'t' b'notice it before and i wonder if while installing an application an image of' b'the disk was created, or if win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files.' b"i couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of" b'the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space. does anybody know if this is just' b'something the people who installed win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'anibal' b'--' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'anibal mayorga wenark dr w: b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------'
