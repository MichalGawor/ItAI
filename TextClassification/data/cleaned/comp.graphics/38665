b'' b'if this question is covered elsewhere, i apologize, but i need information' b'fast.' b'' b'my department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system' b'on our network of ibm rs6000 workstations. this is not an area in which i' b'have any expertise, so i wonder if anyone out there can offer advice. we' b'would like a system, based either on vhs or 8mm video which will allow one' b"write video, frame by frame on tape for play-back in real time. it's for" b'visualization of physics problems. can anyone tell me what hardware is' b'available which would work for our system? some support software is' b'obviously needed too, but nothing particularly sophisticated, since the' b'software we actually use for the visualization is all already written.' b'' b"please email with replies, as i don't read this group. many thanks for your" b'help.' b'' b'dr. m. e. j. newman.' b'department of physics,' b'cornell university.' b'' b''
