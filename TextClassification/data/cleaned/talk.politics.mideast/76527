b'' b'' b'' b'henrik] the armenians in nagarno-karabagh are simply defending their' b'henrik] rights to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are' b'henrik] invading their homeland.' b'' b'' b'he] homeland? first nagarno-karabagh was armenians homeland today' b'he] fizuli, lacin and several villages (in azerbadjan)' b"he] are their homeland. can't you see the" b'he] the "great armenia" dream in this? with facist methods like' b'he] killing, raping and bombing villages. the last move was the' b'he] blast of a truck with kurdish refugees, trying to' b'he] escape the from lacin, a city that was "given" to the kurds' b'he] by the armenians.' b'' b'nagorno-karabakh is in azerbaijan not armenia. armenians have lived in nagorno-' b'karabakh ever since there were armenians. armenians used to live in the areas' b'between armenia and nagorno-karabakh and this area is being used to invade' b'nagorno- karabakh. armenians are defending themselves. if azeris are dying' b'because of a policy of attacking armenians, then something is wrong with this' b'policy.' b'' b'if i recall correctly, it was stalin who caused all this problem with land' b'in the first place, not the armenians.' b'' b'henrik] however, i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane' b'henrik] to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one' b'henrik] that happened last summer. turkey searched an american plane' b'henrik] (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to armenia.' b'' b"he] don't speak about things you don't know: u.s. cargo planes" b'he] were heading to armenia. when the turkish authorities' b'he] announced that they were going to search these cargo' b"he] planes of these planes returned to it's base in germany." b'he] of these planes were searched in turkey. the content of' b'he] of the other planes? not hard to guess, is it? it was sure not' b'he] humanitarian aid.....' b'' b'what story are you talking about? planes from the u.s. have been sending' b'aid into armenian for two years. i would not like to guess about what were in' b'the planes in your story, i would like to find out.' b'' b'' b"he] search turkish planes? you don't know what you are talking about." b"he] turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons" b'he] to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan' b'he] it self, not the karabag province. so why search a plane for weapons' b"he] since it's content is announced to be weapons?" b'' b"it's too bad you would want turkey to start a war with armenia."
