b'' b'' b"i'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? i've been" b"doing it my self over miles, on my current toyota truck i've got" b"over 150k. i've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a" b'transmission. my experiences suggest otherwise. what techniques do you use?' b'' b"yeah. i don't use the clutch all the time either. i've done it" b"with fords, bmw, datsun, and chevy and it works fine. i can't think of" b'any reason that it would damage the tranny. essentially you are just' b'doing what the synchros do anyhow match the engine speed with the' b'tranny speed and slip it into gear.' b'' b'' b'on some old pieces of junk i drove, the transmission was so' b'worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.' b"to date i've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords a chevy. some where" b'harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother' b'quicker easier they where to shift.' b'' b'my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently' b'wrist back on the shift lever. if for some reason i miss the shift window,' b"i lightly press the accelerator try agian. i've found that clutchless" b'shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms i also skip gears some' b'times using b'' b'sounds about right. i usually slip it out during throttle-down' b'and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right' b'(usually about a second) and then slip it into gear...' b'' b'krispy' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------' b'jon "you obviously don\'t know who you\'re dealing with" gross' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------'
