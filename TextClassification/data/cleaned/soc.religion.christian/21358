b'' b'' b"one thing i don't understand is why being sacred should make the" b'temple rituals secret.' b'' b'on of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they' b'should not be spoken of in a "common manner" or "trampled under' b'feet" such as the lords name is today. the ceremonies are' b'performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside' b'as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place. we believe that the' b'ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they' b'are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the' b'temple. so from our point of view, when they are brought' b'out into the public, they are being trampled under feet,' b'because of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore' b'offensive to us.' b'' b'please do not assume that because of my use of the words' b"'we' and 'our' that i'm an official spokesman for the lds" b'church. i am merely stating what i believe is the general' b'feeling among us. others feel free to disagree.' b'' b'--' b'steve ward'
