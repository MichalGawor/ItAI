b'' b'' b'new series mercedes benz wagon...' b'particularly, i would like to hear about power (manual t. only)...' b'any comparisons between the saab line and the mercedes would be helpful.' b'' b'if a manual transmission is a "must have", then the m-b 300te is not in' b'the running. you cannot get a manual transmission in that car in north' b'america. it seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the' b'distributors) are not interested in manual trannies.' b'' b"the line comes with a hp engine. all earlier years are hp." b'i have an 300e, with a "mere" hp and auto tranny, and i find that' b'it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation. more is always' b"nice, but i can't complain." b'' b'i test drove a saab cse last fall. here are my impressions:' b'' b'1) awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.' b'2) if you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel' b'drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously "hook" into' b'the corner. not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful' b'front drive cars. (the cse is 200hp. mercedes is rear-drive, so it' b'does not have this problem.)' b'3) huge interior and cargo space.' b'4) the most "rubbery" shifter i have ever encountered. i drove a 5spd. it' b"was absolutely numb. you might be able to get used to it i don't know." b"i also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right." b"from the shifter's position, i got the impression that saab really designed" b'the car for an automatic.' b'5) it was rather noisy: engine buzz, rattles, and creaks. (mercedes does' b'not exhibit these characteristics.)' b'' b'you should also check out the new bmw "touring". this is a wagon version' b'of the 525i. it fits into the class with the 300te and saabs.' b'' b'--' b'michael chmilar'
