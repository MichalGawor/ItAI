b'' b' i have two questions:' b'' b' i have been having troubles with my wordperfect for windows.' b' when i try to select and change fonts, etc. some of the text' b' disappears. i tried to center two lines once, and the second' b' line disappeared. i can not find the error, and i do not' b' know how to correct it.' b'' b' is this the right newsgroup? where should i go?' b'' b' e-mail prefered...' b'' b" b'' b'i know you said e-mail preferred but because this is a common problem' b"with wpwin i'll post it here." b'' b'the screen only looks like the text is gone. usually you can just' b'page-up then page-down and when it does a complete refresh the' b'text reappears. i have had--on "rare" occasions--to completely' b'exit (save first) the program. when i reopened the file, all chaos' b"had been resolved. i don't know why it does this, but it is annoying." b'the graphics problems have now made me a word for windows user!!' b'' b''
