b'' b'' b' regarding pointing an antenna at a "leaky" catv cable:' b'' b' wow, what a concept! does anybody want to speculate on how this' b' "non-connection" would fit into the theft of cable services laws?' b' it seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into' b' the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to' b' stand upon in court.' b'' b' well, the catv company, in the us, is accountable to the fcc for how' b" much transmission their cables make. in fact, i've heard first hand" b' about how the catv company asked to inspect the wiring in a' b" home/business to find the source of rf leaks. i've heard many of their" b' vans have rf detectors and they keep one eye on them as they drive down' b' the street.' b'' b' if the cable is leaky enough to have usable signal, i would guess that' b" they're probably in violation of fcc transmission laws." b'' b' in england they do (did?) require permits to operate a tv!!!' b' supposedly, the "tv police" drove around with rf detectors looking for' b" the if or whatever produced by a receiver that wasn't registered. i'm" b' guessing the purpose was just something else they could get away with' b' taxing. i don\'t know if the "tv police were/are just urban legend or' b' an actuality.' b'' b"the tv police are still with us i'm afraid. a pound fine goes out to" b'the unlicensed users(if caught).'
