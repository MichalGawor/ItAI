b'' b' i read an article about a poll done of students at the ivy league' b' schools in which it was reported that a third of the students' b' indentified themselves as atheists. this is a lot higher than among the' b' general population. i wonder what the reasons for this discrepancy are?' b' is it because they are more intelligent? younger? is this the wave of' b' the future?' b'' b'i would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which' b'ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus. in the real world' b"(tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock" b'themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those' b'people who are of the same opinion as they are. in college you are' b'constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have' b'different ideas about life, the universe, and everything. it is much much' b"harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from" b'reaching you.' b'' b'so, in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to' b'atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in' b'their beliefs over four years. there is nowhere to run.... b'' b' this is patently absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher' b' must learn not to be frightened by absurdities. bertrand russell' b'' b'nanci' b'.........................................................................' b'if you know (and are sure of) the author of this quote, please send me' b'the fate of the country does not depend on what kind of paper you drop into' b'the ballot box once a year, but on what kind of man you drop from your' b'chamber into the street every morning.' b''
