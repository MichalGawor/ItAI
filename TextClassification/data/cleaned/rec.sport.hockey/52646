b'' b': mvp biggest biggest' b': suprise disappointment' b':' b': los angeles kings robitaille donnelly hrudey' b':' b':' b': i would have chosen alex zhitnik for biggest suprise. they' b": did expect that he would become a great defenseman, but i don't" b': think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his' b': rookie year. his speed, skating ability, and puck control is' b': exceptional he is the one to watch on the kings.' b':' b'' b'i agree, with marty mcsorely and warren rychel running a close second and' b'third. i am surprised more people have not noted knickle as the biggest' b'surprise, even though i personally do not really rate him well. the biggest' b'disappointment has to be carson. though this is really unfair, since too much' b'was expected of him. the second biggest disappointment is melrose, with his' b'adolescent handling of the goaltending problems. putting hrudey on the bench' b'for a month is just stupid. it did not contribute to the team coming out of' b'its slump. mvp is surely robitaille.' b'' b'dvb'
