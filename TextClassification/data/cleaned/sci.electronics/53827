b'' b"i've had my fluke 8060a here at work for just over years now." b'it is a wonderful meter. several colleagues here have some of the' b'newer fluke meters, though i still would just as soon hang on to my' b'8060. the a is the 1980s digial "analog" to the simpson b'analog dmm of the 1950-1960s. there was/is an 8060b that had' b'extended frequency response.' b'' b"i've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by soar that i keep" b"in my toolbox at home. i've had that for six or seven years now" b'and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than' b'adequate for day-to-day hobby use. i think soar oems their stuff' b"for a number of vendors. some of jdr microdevices' stuff looks" b"rather similar to soar's." b'' b'' b'--' b'bill mayhew neoucom computer services department' b'rootstown, oh usa phone:
