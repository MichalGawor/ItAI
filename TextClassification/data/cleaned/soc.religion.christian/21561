b'' b'' b'hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of babel, we see how' b'god punished by giving us different language. can we assume then that' b'if angels have their own language at all, that they have the same one' b'amongst other angels? after all, they were not punished in any manner.' b'' b'' b'maybe before babel,everyone including angels spoke the same language,so at' b'babel, god punished us by giving us languages different from the original one.' b"so if that's the case,then angels now would be speaking in the tongue mankind" b'spoke before babel.' b'' b'jonah'
