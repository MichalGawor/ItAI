b'' b'clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to' b'conceal use of super-encryption. an automated full-system surveillance' b'mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key f,' b'can validate clipper wrappers and n:esn associations, but it cannot reveal' b'in realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,' b'which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate' b'pieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.' b'' b"the serial number will be in a bit block, with a bit filler. doesn't" b'take a lot to check to see if that is correct.' b'' b'yes, but the extra encryption could be applied *before* the message' b'is encrypted by the clipper, so that the wrapper would be fine, the' b"phone's serial number and the session key would be in the law-enforcement" b"field, etc., but the message wouldn't be readable even if the particular" b"clipper's key were obtained from the escrow agents. in fact, it shouldn't" b'even be possible to detect that a message has been double-encrypted without' b'a court order, right?'
