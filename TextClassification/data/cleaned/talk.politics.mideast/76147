(kuwait has directly participated in the airlift of food to' b'sarajevo.)' b'' b" besides, there's no case that can be made for us military involvement" b" there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, liberia, angola, or" b" (it appears with the khmer rouge's new campaign) cambodia. non-whites" b" don't count?" b'' b'hmm...some might say kuwaitis are non-white. ooops, i forgot, kuwaitis are' b'"oil rich", "loaded with petro-dollars", etc so they don\'t count.' b'' b'' b'' b'---peter' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
