b'' b"|\twhat's really interesting is that from what i can tell, the mis" b"|folks in the basement with their es/9000 don't seem to be pissed at ibm." b'|why? i have no idea. either ibm really does take care of their customers' b'|better, or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the' b'|smaller vendors do.' b'' b'no, mis folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts' b'of their budget allocated "upgrades", "maintenance", and "new purchases",' b'and a lot of ibm mainframe purchases are actually "leases" and so' b'is the software.' b'' b'basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and' b'designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop on a' b'sparc only to see a faster machine appear a year later. mis types' b'upgrade once every years, and their costs are amortized and' b'depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies' b'the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting,' b'payroll, etc.' b'' b'now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some' b"reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every" b'engineer with a new cray on his desktop every year. b'' b'brian' b''
