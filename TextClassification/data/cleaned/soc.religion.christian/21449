b'' b'nabil ayoub writes:' b'' b'as a final note, the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign a' b'common statement of christology, in which the heresey of monophysitism' b'was condemned. so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in' b'monophysitism.' b'' b'sorry!' b'' b'what does the coptic church believe about the will and energy of christ?' b' were there one or were there two (i.e. human and divine) wills and' b'energies in him.' b'' b'also, what is the objection ot the copts with the pope of rome (i.e. why' b'is there a coptic catholic church)? do you reject the supreme' b'jurisdiction of the 263rd sucessor of st. peter (who blessed st. john' b'mark, bishop of alexandria was translator for) and his predecessors? or' b'his infallibility? or what other things perhaps?' b'' b'for your first set of questions (regarding the energy and will of christ)' b'i quote to you the relevant part of the statement signed by both eastern' b'(chalcedonian) and oriental (non-chalcedonian) orthodox scholars a few' b'years ago (both families both orthodox churches) b'' b'1. both families agreed in condemning the eutychian heresy. both families' b'confess that the logos, the second person of the holy trinity, only begotten' b'of the father before the ages and consubstantial with him, was incarnate and' b'was born from the virgin mary theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect' b'man with soul, body and mind \\nu o \\upsilon \\zeta he was crucified,' b'died, was buried and rose from the dead on the third day, ascended to the' b'heavenly father, where he sits on the right hand of the father as lord of all' b'creation. at pentecost, by the coming of the holy spirit he manifested the' b'church as his body. we look forward to his coming again in the fullness of his' b'glory, according to the scriptures.' b'' b'2. both families condemn the nestorian heresy and the crypto-nestorianism of' b'theodoret of cyrus. they agree that it is not sufficient merely to say that' b'christ is consubstantial both with his father and with us, by nature god and' b'by nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the logos, who is by nature' b'god, became by nature man, by his incarnation in the fullness of time.' b'' b'3. both families agree that the hypostasis of the logos became composite by' b'uniting to his divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which' b'he has in common with the father and the holy spirit, created human nature,' b'which he assumed at the incarnation and made his own, with its natural will' b'and energy.' b'' b'4. both families agree that the natures with their proper energies and wills' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'are united hypostatically and naturally without confusion, without change,' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'without division and without separation, and that they are distinguished in' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'thought alone.' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'' b'5. both families agree that he who wills and acts is always the one hypostasis' b'of the logos incarnate.' b'' b'[...]' b'' b'i guess that adresses your question adequately.' b'' b'as for your second set of questions, i am afraid they are irrelevant to the' b'discussion (at least from my point of view) of monophysitism. i do not see' b'how they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an' b'endless orthodox-rc debate which i do not plan to engage into). as a brief' b'answer to your questions, the position of the coptic orthodox church' b'regarding the roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.' b'is exactly the same as all the other orthodox churches.' b'' b'peace,' b'' b'nabil' b'' b'.-------------------------------------------------------------.' b'/ nabil ayoub b'/ engine research center b'/ dept. of mechanical engineering b'/ university of wisconsin-madison b"'-------------------------------------------------------------'"
