b'' b'' b"here's another question by a hesitant powerbook purchaser." b'i want to be able to run mathematica and would like to hear some comments' b'from the gallery about this. how much slower does the program run on a' b'machine without an fpu (namely a pb160) versus a machine with an fpu' b'(namely a pb170). what types of calculations get bogged down the most. i' b'primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with' b"analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. i don't do a lot of" b'numerical work. would a pb160 with a lot of memory and the very nice' b'video port be sufficient or should i really try to get an fpu for this' b'type of work? is a pb170 with 8mb faster than a pb160 with or 16mb.' b'all comments appreciated.' b'' b''
