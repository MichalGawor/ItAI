b'' b'' b'you believe that individuals should have the right to own weapons of' b'mass destruction? i find it hard to believe that you would support a' b"neighbor's right to keep nuclear weapons, biological weapons, and nerve" b'gas on his/her property.' b'' b'that really depends upon where you draw the line while defining' b'these weapons, and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of' b"modern practice five months or five centuries down the road. i'll give" b"you a little hint: see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the" b'road? in the usa, that is a weapon of mass destruction, biological in' b'nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate' b'the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water. so,' b'where do *you* draw the line? in the usa, the epa has ruled that' b'a pile of scrap iron is illegal. care to draw a thinner line this time?' b'' b"< isu only censors what i read, not what i say. don't blame them. b'< usenet: post to exotic, distant machines. meet exciting, b'< unusual people. and flame them.
