b'' b'excerpts from netnews.sci.econ: 5-apr-93 re: supply side economic po..' b'[...]' b'' b' the deficits declined from reaching a low of of gnp before' b' the tax and spending hike of reversed the trend.' b'' b' brett' b'is this true some more details would be appreciated.' b'' b'yes, sadly, this is true. the primary reason, and the essence of the' b'details that you are seeking, is that the grahm-rudman budget controls' b'were working. in fact, they were working so well that unless the feds' b'did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. so bush' b'and the democrats got together in a budget summit and replaced' b'grahm-rudman with the now historic grand compromise in which bush' b'"consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending' b'increases.' b'' b'as it turned out, the taxes killed the reagan expansion and the caps' b'on spending increases were dispelled by clinton in his first act as' b'president (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax' b'increases).' b'' b'the result is that clinton now hopes to reduce the deficit to a level' b'above where it was when reagan left office.' b'' b'chew on that awhile.'
