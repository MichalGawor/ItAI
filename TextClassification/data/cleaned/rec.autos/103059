b'' b"i'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it. since i paid" b'cash for the last car i bought i did not have to worry about' b'whether or not i had a good amount of insurance on it because' b'of a bank loan. i just put the amount that i wanted (not what' b'a bank would have wanted). friends are telling me that banks' b'require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it' b'is collateral on loans. is this true? can that insurance be' b"gotten as part of my other insurance? i assume i don't have to" b'pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance.' b'am i correct? i hear about accident/health type insurance at' b'the dealers and i am pretty sure these are just money makers' b"for them. i just want to verify that i don't _have_ to buy" b'these at all. or any other types of extras.' b'' b'what do i have to pay for? car, tax, license. anything else?' b'' b'ellen' b''
