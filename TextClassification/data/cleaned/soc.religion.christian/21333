b'' b'' b' about tongues b'' b' the concept of tongues as used at pentecost seems an outdated concept' b' now. with the bible available in nearly every language, and missionaries' b' who are out there in all languages, why does the church need tongues?' b'' b'i guess there are at least some people who are not able to support' b'this claim. there are still a lot of languages without the bible, or a' b'part of the bible. there are still many languages which we are not' b'able to write, simply because the written version of the language has' b'not yet been defined!' b'' b'i guess this is one of the main goals for wycliffe bible translators:' b"to define rules and a grammar for writing the 'rest' of the languages" b'of this world. i do not see that any of them will have any reason to' b'become unemployed during the foreseeable future. (provided they get' b'their neccessary support!) and still they are one of the largest' b'missionary organizations of the world.' b'' b'bjorn' b'--' b'______________________________________________________________________' b's-mail: e-mail:' b'|__ sintef delab' b'| n-7034 trondheim tel: b'|__/|__/|_ norway fax: b'______________________________________________________________________'
