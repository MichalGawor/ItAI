b'' b'' b"i've recently listened to a tape by dr. stanislaw burzynski, in which he" b'claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti-' b'cancer properties that he names antineoplastons. burzynski says that his' b'work has met with hostility in the united states, despite the favorable' b'responses of his subjects during clinical trials.' b'' b"what is the generally accepted opinion of dr. burzynski's research? he" b'paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an' b'intolerant medical establishment, but i have no basis from which to judge' b"his claims. two weeks ago, however, i read that the nih's department of" b"alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynski's" b"work. their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldn't investigate a" b"treatment that didn't seem promising." b'' b"any opinions on burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current" b'status of his research would be appreciated.' b'' b'--' b'joshua schwimmer' b'' b"there's been extensive discussion on the compuserve cancer forum about dr." b"burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father" b'to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma. this disease is' b'universally and usually rapidly fatal. after diagnosis in june the' b'tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy. the forum' b"member checked extensively on dr. burzynki's track record for this disease." b'he spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from' b'glioblastoma following this treatment and to an nci oncologist who had' b'audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.' b"after the forum member's father began dr. burzynski's treatment in" b'september, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his' b'oncologist in chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of' b'shrinkage or necrosis.' b'' b"the patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live" b"past december was vehemently opposed to his trying dr. burzynski's" b"treatment. since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under dr. burzynski's" b"treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these" b'treatments, saying "if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it."' b'' b'dr. burzynski is an m.d., ph.d. with a research background who found a' b'protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,' b'and administers it to patients with certain cancer types. there is little' b'understanding of the actual mechanism of activity.' b'' b'/*********************************************************************/' b'/* david e. scheim b'/* bitnet: none b'/* compuserve: fax: b'/* b'/* disclaimer: these comments are offered to share knowledge based b'/* upon my personal views. they do not represent the positions b'/* of my employer. b'/*********************************************************************/'
