has been referred to as a hacker, but most' b"internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this. instead, a" b"``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious," b'curious, and driven

encryption is `steganography' or the" b'techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication' b'but concealing the very existence of the communication itself.' b'many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the' b'proliferation of computer technology. for example, it is possible' b'to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,' b"typically the most 'noisy'. in addition, when such an item is" b'posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually' b'untraceable communication can take place between sender and' b'receiver. for steganographic communications in the electronic' b'realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where' b'individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual' b'users decode particular messages with their unique key. an' b'anonymous pool has been set up by miron cuperman' b'commands in the subject line:' b'' b'subscribe' b'unsubscribe' b'help' b'' b'_____' b"<5.5 what is `security through obscurity'?" b'' b"`security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain" b'protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information' b'or programs relating to them. for example, a company may not make' b"public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade" b"`attacks' based on knowledge of it. another example would be" b'concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in' b'operating systems. or, some reliance may be made on the fact that' b'some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious' b"because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' this" b'argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and usenet' b"posting `forgery'. `security through obscurity' is regarded as a" b'very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at' b"worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). see the faq" b'for alt.security.' b'' b'some remarks of john perry barlow, cofounder of the electronic' b'frontier foundation, directed to nsa agents at the first' b'international symposium on national security national' b'competitiveness held in mclean, virginia dec. b'' b' digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep' b" contained. this stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile. it's" b' almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate. if' b" something hits the net and it's something which people on there" b' find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind. i' b' believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into' b' an environment where any information which is at all interesting' b' to people is going to get out. and there will be very little' b' that you can do about it. this is not a bad thing in my view,' b' but you may differ...' b'' b'_____' b"<5.6 what are `identity daemons'?" b'' b'rfc-931 describes a protocol standard that allows unix programs to' b"query a remote user's login name after connection to a local" b'communication socket (a connection of this type is established' b'during ftp and telnet sessions, for example). the standard is not' b'widely supported, perhaps of internet sites currently implement' b'it but the number is increasing. the mechanism is detrimental to' b'anonymity. regular users cannot disable it but system' b'adminstrators can circumvent it. this standard may represent
