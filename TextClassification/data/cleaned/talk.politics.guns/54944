b'' b'ok, here goes. yes folks, i realize i have stuck my foot in my mouth' b'quite a few times already so please let me make some clarifications. my' b'inaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of knowledge. thanks' b'to you kind (and some not so kind) people i am learning. some people' b'have given me several good points to ponder and i see how i was wrong.' b'in no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to' b'further the anti-gun cause. i have said several times before (but' b'nobody seemed to be listening) that i am pro-gun and anti-gun-control.' b'' b'as far as the race can of worms that i have opened up i have only one' b'thing to say i am in no way prejudiced. some of the things i have' b'stated were said to demonstrate that i am not prejudiced and/or a racist' b'but i have been accused of being too aware of race and prejudiced. i will not' b'say anymore about that subject because no matter what i say it will be the' b'wrong thing.' b'' b'boy, what a start to being on a new group. oh well, things have been' b'worse in my life.' b'' b'i hope this clears things up but i guess that will remain to be seen.' b'' b'by for now,' b'' b'jason'
