b'' b'how sensible is des encrypted data towards bit errors? how much data per' b'bit will be lost in average (i assume you still have the correct key)?' b'' b"it depends on the mode you're using. for a single 64-bit input block, a" b'one-bit error will have a percent chance of corrupting each of the b'output bits in other words, it essentially turns the output block into' b"a random number. if you're encrypting data in cbc mode, however, only the" b'one 64-bit block will be affected. the next block, and all that follow it' b'will be decrypted properly.' b'' b"it's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if" b'corrupted bits are likely.' b'' b'- todd'
