b'' b'' b" there's no objective physics; einstein and bohr have told us that." b' speaking as one who knows relativity and quantum mechanics, i say:' b' bullshit.' b'speaking as someone who also knows relativity and quantum mechanics, i say:' b'go ahead, punk, make my day. my degree can beat up your degree.' b'' b'simple. take out some physics books, and start looking for statements which' b'say that there is no objective physics. i doubt you will find any. you might' b'find statements that there is no objective length, or no objective location,' b'but no objective _physics_? (consider, for instance, that speed-of-light-in-' b'vacuum is invariant. this sounds an awful lot like an objective' b'speed-of-light-in-vacuum.)' b'' b'or, you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor. if you take' b'a look at quantum mechanics, many objective observations can be made' b'as well. however, physics is not objective. bohr said the randomness' b'of atomic motion is inherent in the motion itself. einstein said that' b'nature is deterministic; it is our method of observation that inserts the' b'randomness. they were talking about the exact same results.' b'' b'but neither of them claimed to have experimental evidence that proved' b'them right. in a similar vein, there is as yet no experimental evidence' b'for supersymmetric particles; so some physicists believe in them, and' b"some don't but all agree that either there is an objectively true" b'answer to the question.' b'' b'depends on how you look at it, i guess.' b'--' b'mark pundurs' b'' b'any resemblance between my opinions and those' b'of wolfram research, inc. is purely coincidental'
