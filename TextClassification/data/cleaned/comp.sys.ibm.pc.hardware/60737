b'' b'hi. i am trying to set up a conner and a quantum 80at drive. i have' b"the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work" b'the other way around). i am able to access both drives if i boot from a' b'floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves. i am running msdos and' b'have the conner partitioned as primary dos, and is formatted with system' b'files. i have tried all different types of setups, and even changed ide' b'controller cards. if i boot from a floppy, everything works great (except' b"the booting part the system doesn't report an error message or anything," b'just hangs there. does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else' b'run into a similar problem? i was thinking that i might have to update the bios' b'on one of the drives (is this possible?). any suggestions/answers would be' b'greatly appreciated. please reply to:' b'' b'jason badry' b''
