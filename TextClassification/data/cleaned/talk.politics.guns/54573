b'' b'this was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.' b'==============================================================' b'hi folks;' b'' b'wednesday marked day the beginning of the trial. opening' b'statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,' b'each side presenting its version of what happenned last august.' b'' b'the prosecution argued that weaver and his family moved to' b'idaho in anticipating a battle with the "evil" federal' b'government. the prosecution alleges that weaver sold federal' b'agents "sawed off" shotguns and later failed to appear for' b'trial: despite repeated "good faith" efforts to get weaver' b'to surrender peacefully, weaver refused. the shootout erupted' b'when weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and' b'began firing. according to the prosecution, three people' b'were taking an "offensive action" against an fbi helicopter' b'when an fbi sniper killed vicki weaver.' b'' b'the defense argued that weaver and his family moved to northern' b'idaho in to practice their religion in peace. they wanted' b'simply to be left alone. weaver was induced by federal agents to' b'sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution' b'alleged, want to become a "regular supplier"). the defense also' b'argued that the federal government sought to arrest weaver when' b"he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly," b'but i assume that this is a reference to the white separatist' b"angle of the story. we'll know more as things develop]. the" b'failure to appear in court happenned because weaver was given' b'an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.' b'the shootout occurred when federal agent arthur roderick killed' b"weaver's dog that was in proximity to weaver's son, samuel. weaver" b'then fired in self-defense. in the ensuing battle, federal' b'agent william degan was killed (when his gun was later found,' b'there were cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:' b'however, agents were near the body for an extended period of' b'time and could have played with the select-fire this will' b'have to be more fully explained). finally, the defense claims' b'that vicki weaver was only going to "look at the body" [not recover?]' b'of her son when she was cut-down by an fbi sniper.' b'' b'prosecution quote: "weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made' b'that confrontation." asst. u.s. attorney kim lindquist' b'' b'defense quote: "the evidence in this case is going to show that' b'this is a case where randy weaver and kevin harris are charged' b"with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that" b'the government did commit." gerry spence [nice soundbite!]' b'' b'notes: the _idaho statesman_ claims that weaver supporters' b"heeded a call from spence not to repeat yesterday's protests" b'outside the courthouse. however, the local nbc affiliate' b'again had footage on the news with supporters including' b'"tim" again. "tim" claimed he was a skinhead, who were "ordinary,' b'working class people." he also claimed he was for "white pride,' b'not white power."' b'' b'outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview' b'with bo gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly' b'what the government wants to smear randy weaver.' b'' b'in an affiliated article carried in the _idaho statesman_, about' b'a dozen lawyers were among the or so people packed into the' b'courthouse. these lawyers were present to watch gerry spence' b'in action, and to perhaps learn something from him. some' b'tidbits: spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son kent' b'were volunteering their time to represent weaver because they' b'believed in him. spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,' b'repeatedly walked behind weaver and placed his hands on the' b'defendants shoulders (weaver broke down and cried during the' b'recounting of his wife\'s death), and spence compared the "sawed' b'off" shotgun to driving mph when the limit was (another' b'good one!).' b'' b'today (thursday, april 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to' b'begin presenting evidence.' b'' b'drew' b'=============================================================' b'' b'' b'--' b'**************************************************************' b'* senior customer engineer b'* intergraph electronics b'* east evelyn avenue voice: b'* mountain view, ca fax: b'**************************************************************'
