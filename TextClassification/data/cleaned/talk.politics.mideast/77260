b'' b'' b'it is easy for sen. biden to say that when there are no us troops in' b'zepa or srebinica or sarejevo...' b'' b'the existing un policy may certaining be wrong, but the us wants' b'to dictate policy, and make europe responsible for the consequences' b'of that policy...' b'' b'...bosnia is a big enough problem for the us to preach about what' b'other countries should be doing with their forces...but its forces' b'are safely tucked away at home in the us.' b'' b'gerald' b'' b'' b'look nobody asked those countries about their un forces' b'to be on the ground. they can take their forces which are' b'incomponent and ineffective at the first place. and let whoever are' b'willing to do the job what it takes. how anyone can defend this' b'stinking un force on the ground who let the bosnnian pm' b'yanked out from the un vehicle and being shot by the serbian' b'military? how anyone can defend this un force who are just watching' b'the shelling on cities and towns everyday? how anyone can' b'defend and say those stinking un forces being effective' b'when bosnian had almost children casualties between age' b'groups? i think talking about the current un forces to bosnian' b'muslims is just an insult to their casualties.' b'' b'i think senator biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.' b'europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this' b'world. like biden said, they are the bigots when it comes to' b'cultural difference and minorty closer to their home.' b'because they get rid of their minorities long long time' b'ago starting in 15th centuries. and they let adolph' b'to take care of the rest in 20th century. but he was much more' b'naughty than they expected because he dared to step many' b'toes. so, why spoil the good thing now when serbs doing today what' b'they were thinking the same yesterday.' b'' b'c. akgun'
