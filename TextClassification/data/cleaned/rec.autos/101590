b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'my friend brought a subaru svx recently. i had drove it for couples times and i' b'think its a great car, esp on snow. however when she took it to a local subaru' b'dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about dollars. the dealer' b'told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to' b'disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.' b'at first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto' b'but found out the they are charging roughly the same price. so is there any' b'svx owner out there that has the same problem and if the oil change story is' b'true, then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me. by the way, the car' b'looks great.' b'' b'swd wan.' b''
