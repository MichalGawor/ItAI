b'' b'' b're: extended ka bands.' b'' b"i recently bought a band detector. you guys must all think i'm" b'nuts, right? well, i did a little research into ka usage in this' b'area and found out that ka is not currently being used in this state' b"as well as surrounding states. here's how i found out:" b'' b"- a cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know" b"what ka is. he's heard of k, which is what they use here and i" b'explained that ka is used for photo radar etc.. he then said, yeah,' b'"ka stands for k automatic"... duuhh. he then went on to say that' b'plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high' b"tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much." b'' b'- my year old band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,' b'even the real sneaky ones.' b'' b'- when i called the escort shop, they confirmed that ka is not used here' b'or in surrounding states. they did claim that laser was being used' b'a lot here, which i was quite skeptical of.' b'' b'so in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting' b'months for a state of the art detector, i got a low priced, high' b'performance band escort incidentally its performance is equal' b'to their top of the line model in x and k band detection. i know that' b"escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but i've never fully" b'relied on a detector and i was convinced that the escorts would be at' b'least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.' b'' b'' b'eliot'
