b'' b'\ti set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of' b'\tfiles on disk. the general setup is designed so that when users' b'\tconnect they send a private key encrypted using the system public' b"\tkey and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the" b'\tone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk. the' b'\tresult of this is that even if i reveal the system private key it' b'\tis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the' b'\tmachine. what is possible is for someone to use the revealed' b'\tsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personal' b'\tprivate keys during the authentication sequence.' b'' b'any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...' b'' b'' b'just a question.' b"as a provider of a public bbs service aren't you bound by law to gurantee" b'intelligble access to the data of the users on the bbs, if police comes' b'with sufficent authorisation i guessed this would be a basic condition' b'for such systems. (i did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in switzerland)' b'' b'friendly greetings,' b'germano caronni' b'--' b"instruments register only through things they're designed to register." b'space still contains infinite unknowns.' b'pgp-key-id:341027'
