b'' b'' b'' b'i do not know much about adcom mobil audio products, but i do know for a fact' b'that adcom does not make its own "high end" home audio equptment and that b'of it comes directly out of tiawan...' b'' b'like most high-volume manufacturers, adcom has most of its pc boards' b'assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east). final' b'assembly _and testing_ are done in east brunswick.' b'' b'' b'and of course you older folks on the net will remember' b'way back when adcom got its rave reviews and kudos (ca' b'1985 or so) their amp and preamp were not only' b'designed here but built here in the usa. then they' b'went to mexico and then to taiwan right after their' b'sales skyrocketed because of their stereopile' b'review!!! if you have units that old look for made in' b'--- stickers on your unit.' b''
