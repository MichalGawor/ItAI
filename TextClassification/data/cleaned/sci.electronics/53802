b'' b'' b'currently i am using the microcontroller with external eprom..' b'' b'in order to drive the dc motor (with direction) i use the pulse width modultion' b'' b'thru software control(assembly language programming). however i am afraid that' b'' b'they will be overheads and thus alter the pulse timing. my question is' b'' b'is the software pwm control reliable?. i understand that port is a latch' b'' b'and so i vary the duty cycle by setting it high first and at the desire' b'' b'duty cycle then i set low..? any improments b'' b'' b''
