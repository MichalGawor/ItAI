b'' b'' b'{ i am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding' b'{ extended operation of my g2k 486-33v with the cover removed' b'{ from the enclosure. there are a of reasons i am considering' b'{ this, including quick access to jumpers during complex i/o card' b'{ setups.' b'{' b'{ my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the' b'{ cooling flow of air from the fan, "hot spots" may develop on my' b'{ motherboard or elsewhere. my g2k has intake air vents in the' b'{ front of the enclosure right at mb level. these vents would be' b'{ removed along with the top cover in this scenario, rendering' b'{ airflow from the fan pretty useless.' b'{' b"{ however, short periods in this mode don't seem to heat things up" b'{ too much, but my conclusions are far from scientific...' b'{' b'{ tim' b'' b'i ran a out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no' b'major effects (yeah, no case at all, mb sitting on a static bag)' b'other than the noise from the poersupply it ran pretty good.' b'as for cooling problems i bought a inch fan and turned' b'it on full and set the output directly on the motherboard.' b'' b'i did finally get a case though and i am still running the parts' b'with no ill effects.' b'' b'i also had no kids to spill things on the mb i had no cat leaving' b'hair on the mb etc. etc. on and on....' b'' b'the two major concerns are keeping static away and keeping the mb cool' b'enjoy' b'' b'-david' b'' b'=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=' b'' b'(301)604-5976 8n1 ...uunet!mimsy!anagld!c-cat!david' b'=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-='
