b'' b'' b' "it is a matter of logic that government-run systems are' b' inefficient, and the fact that the highly bureaucratized private' b' sector system in the us is vastly more inefficient is therefore' b' irrelevant.' b'' b'\tproof that the entire private sector is vastly more inefficient?' b'' b'good point, brett. it might merely be proof that basic health care' b'markets operate differently, with certain nonmarket phenomenom that' b"the private sector can't handle well (like armies vs. warlords). in" b'that respect, the effects on american society vs. canadian/european' b'society might also be different.' b'' b' \tit is, for example, of no relevance that blue cross' b' of massachusetts employs people, more than are employed in' b" all of canada's health programs, which insure times as many" b' people"' b'' b'blue cross is the government health insurance provider.' b'' b'good point again. blue cross in the u.s. is quite convoluted compared' b'to the canadian and german insurance funds, which have a minimal' b'organization to coordinate it. if anything, bureaucracy now needs to' b'be built up in canada to combat fraud, such as americans crossing the' b'border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and' b'relatives or using phony domestic addresses, or fraud rings stealing' b'them in blocks. our private practices are now recording insurance' b'account numbers, both public insurance and private insurance, which' b'most have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour' b'system.' b'' b'gld' b'--' b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ je me souviens b'gary l. dare'
