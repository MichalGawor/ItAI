b'' b'' b'c hi:' b'c i have a 486dx2-66mhz computer to use with an a/d board' b"c for data acquisition on an at bus...i'm having problems." b'c the at bus runs at mhz correct? so there should' b'c be no bus speed conflict. but i read somewhere that the' b'c new 486dx2-66 mhz cpu runs on a mhz bus is that for' b'c the local bus or the at bus also if so then i have a problem.' b'c b'c when i run on non-turbo-mode the speed goes to mhz and the' b"c a/d doesn't work. please mail your views! thanks." b'c vincent' b'c b'' b'the standard at bus (isa) runs at 8mhz, not mhz, but some' b'non-stnadard isa buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since' b"some boards don't work with faster than standard rates. for instance, my" b'486 has adjustable at bus speeds, and my pas16 audio card chokes when i do' b'ad data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10mhz.' b'' b"the fact that non-turbo-mode speed a/d doesn't work is weird. you may" b"have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'." b'' b'33 mhz bus on the 486dx2 does refer to the local bus. fyi: the at bus' b"operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus" b"interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'." b'' b'-rdd' b'' b'---' b'. winqwk 2.0b#0 unregistered evaluation copy' b'* kmail 2.95d w-net hq, hal9k.ann-arbor.mi.us, or b'' b'----' b'| hal bbs: qwk-to-usenet gateway four v.32bis dial-ins b'| free usenet mail and newsgroups! pcboard 14.5am uupcb kmail b'| call or b'| member of eff, asp, asad 1500mb disk serving ann arbor since
