b'' b'' b'ok, how about this to argue about. why does the sl2 have a much lower base' b"price than the sc2??? it's over 1k cheaper(i forget the exact amount)." b"doesn't it cost more to have the extra doors/windows/locks/motors etc. that" b'are in the door???? perhaps it is just a marketing deal....people want the' b'2door, so they will pay the extra 1.2k???' b'' b"ok, here's what i understand:" b'' b'the sl/sl1/sl2/sw1/sw2 was meant to compete with the following cars:' b'' b'honda civic' b'toyota tercel (sl,sl1)' b'toyota corolla (sl1,sl2)' b'nissan sentra' b"mazda 323/protoge'" b'subaru loyale/impreza' b'isuzu stylus' b'geo prizm' b'ford escort' b'mercury tracer' b'mistubishi mirage' b'plymouth/dodge colt' b'' b'' b'their core competition is the civic, corolla, and sentra. most of the other' b"models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of." b'i threw in the escort/tracer because it has a good amount of japanese' b"technology and has similar reliability stats. i didn't include domestic small" b'cars such as the cavalier, sunbird, shadow, sundance, tempo, and topaz, since i' b'think saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of japanese' b'roots.' b'' b'the sc1/sc2 was meant to compete against the following cars:' b'' b'toyota paseo' b'honda civic si/civic coupes/del sol si' b'nissan nx1600/nx2000' b'mazda mx-3' b'isuzu impulse' b'geo storm' b'ford escort gt' b'' b'' b"if you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're" b'4-door counterparts. the is good reason for this. it is a more upscale and' b'trend-driven market. even though many of these models are based on sedan' b'platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher' b'prices. here are some of the platform derivations i can think of:' b'' b'tercel paseo' b'sentra nx1600/nx2000' b'civic del sol' b'323 mx-3 (not sure on this one)' b'stylus impulse/storm' b'' b'to illustrate, a tercel starts at around while the paseo starts at' b'around even a 4-door tercel will cost less than a 2-door paseo. now,' b"you might be saying that the tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors" b'offer. what i mean is that there is no 4-dr tercel with a comparable' b"powerplant as its sport coupe derivative. let's take another example: the" b'isuzu stylus xs and impulse xs/storm gsi. both have the same powerplants (a' b'1.6l 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.' b'again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more' b'fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment. people are willing to pay more' b'money for this type of car.' b'' b'' b'in short, even though the sc1/sc2 may be smaller, hence "less" car, it\'s market' b'orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent' b'sedan (sl1/sl2) version.' b'' b'i hope this clears things up a bit......' b'' b'' b'mihir shah' b''
