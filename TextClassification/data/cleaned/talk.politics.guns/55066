b'' b'' b'can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes?' b'' b"generally the ship sinks (sorry, there's a picture of the" b'uss iowa next to my desk).' b'' b' bullets go flying every' b'where. imho, these "gunshot wounds" were actually caused when the magazines' b'went up.' b'' b'first, unless that round is chambered there is little threat of' b'penetration by the bullet, or the brass for that matter. unless that' b'expanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice "pop" and not' b"enough threat for even firefighters to worry about. finally, it's" b'rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to' b'a crisp. see, by the time the ammunition went up those people were' b'quite dead. look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising.' b'' b"however, it's my contention that it makes little difference" b'whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the feds seem' b'to have shared responsibility for both.' b'' b"< isu only censors what i read, not what i say. don't blame them. b'< usenet: post to exotic, distant machines. meet exciting, b'< unusual people. and flame them.
