b'' b'' b' to summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something' b'is not forbidden by the bible, then that proves it is ok; i.e. if' b'something cannot be disproven, it is true. he rather seemed to be' b'' b'you are absolutely right. after reading it over again, i realized that i' b'misunderstood what he said. my apologies. as for the question about' b'slavery, i have to disagree. slavery in those times was the same as slavery' b'in the us. some may have been indentured servants, but not all. i would also' b'expect paul to do a little more than just hint about a particular slave.'
