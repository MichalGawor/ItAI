b'' b"my wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office. when" b"the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat weeks) she used" b'the ultrasound to see if everything was ok. (it was)' b'' b'on her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if' b'they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist' b'read the pictures. the doctor very vehemently insisted that they' b'were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were not!' b'' b'my wife is concerned about this. she saw a tv show a couple months' b'back (something like or dateline nbc, etc.) where an expert' b'on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different' b'deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.' b'' b'should my wife be concerned? should we take the pictures to a' b'radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find' b"such an expert in chicago?) we don't really have any special medical" b'reason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see' b"things the ob-gyn can't, then i don't see why we shouldn't use one." b'' b'any thoughts?' b'' b'' b'--' b'doug bank private systems division'
