b'' b'i purchased an lciii recently and had heard a bit about a re-work of the' b'logic board. i opened mine up and found the same re-work, with a small' b'chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two' b"other chips. i'd like to know more about it. could anyone with any or all of" b'the following information please post it? thanks a bunch.' b'' b'1.\twhat does the re-work accomplish (i.e., what does it fix)?' b"2.\twhat are the technical details of the re-work? (i'm looking for" b'things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected,' b'and the pin-outs for those chips.)' b'3.\tis a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without?' b'4.\tcould the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases of' b'the operating system?' b'' b'and, finally,' b'' b'5.\tshould i even be concerned about any of this?' b'' b'' b'' b'keith folsom'
