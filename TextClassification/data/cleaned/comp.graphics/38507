b'' b'' b'ch concerning the proposed newsgroup split, i personally am not in' b'ch favor of doing this. i learn an awful lot about all aspects of' b'ch graphics by reading this group, from code to hardware to' b'ch algorithms. i just think making different groups out of this' b'ch is a wate, and will only result in a few posts a week per group.' b'ch i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for' b'ch discussing all aspects of graphics. anyone else feel this way?' b'ch just curious.' b'' b'i must agree. there is a dizzying number of c.s.amiga.* newsgroups' b'already. in addition, there are very few issues which fall cleanly' b'into one of these categories.' b'' b'also, it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga' b'groups is already plagued with mega-crossposting; thus the group-split' b'would not, in all likelihood, bring about a more structured' b'environment.' b'' b'--' b'/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\' b'/ michael nerone \\"i shall do so with my customary lack of tact; and\\' b'/ internet address: \\since you have asked for this, you will be obliged\\'
