b'' b' i designed and built hardware in that would output a logic level (from' b' a tone detector) upon detecting a microwatt led feet away.' b' used a motorola mrd360, biased linearly in a dc-feedback loop to servo out' b' variations in sunlight (and 60hz from lights). used no lenses.' b' allen sullivan' b' i would be interested in knowing more about the sensing hardware. what did' b' you use for the detector? could you detect the angle of location, or did' b' the system simply respond to the presence of the transmitter in the sensors' b' field of view?' b'' b'phototransistor- x100 x100 ne567' b'with 330kohm limiter' b'feedback to base' b'to control operating point (i expect this really hurts noise figure! any' b'comments from phototransistor experts?)' b'' b'we intended to use this atop a stepper motor, to provide headings to the' b'beacons. the plan was to have or beacons, of different frequencies, in' b'each room, and tell the what frequency to phase-lock to. we did not do so.' b'one challenge was that the available stepper had degree steps!' b'knowing the headings to each beacon, we would have used the surveyor' b"technique of resection to determine robot location.
