b'' b'' b'' b'| b'| i guess hasan finally revealed the source of his claim that israel' b'| diverted water from lebanon--his imagination.' b'| b'| mr. water-head,' b'| i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers, in fact i said that' b'| israel went into southern lebanon to make sure that no' b'| water is being used on the lebanese' b'| side, so that all water would run into jordan river where there' b'| israel will use it !#$%^%&&*-head.' b'|' b'| of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more' b'| difficult. you have not bothered to substantiate this in' b'| any way. basil, do you know of any evidence that would support' b'| this?' b'|' b'| i can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if hasan' b'| had been writing it.' b'|' b'| newsflash:' b'| cairo ap (ancient press). israel today denied egypt acces to the red' b'| sea. in a typical display of israelite agressiveness, the leader of' b'| the israelite slave revolt, former prince moses, parted the red sea.' b'| the action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment.' b'| egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been' b"| denied their livelihood by the parted waters. pharaoh's brave charioteers" b'| were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the' b'| red sea to return to their normal state. unfortunately they suffered' b'| heavy casualties while doing so.' b'' b'hehehe.' b'' b'btw, does the litani river not flow west and not south? i think that its waters' b'stay entirely within lebanese territory and so what hasan says about the jordan' b'river makes no sense, in any case. the hasbani river, on the other hand, flows' b'into the jordan, if i am not mistaken.' b''
