b'' b'after hearing endless debate (read: name-calling) over which os is better, dos' b'and windows or os/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple' b'of different operating systems, i have decided to put the two products to a' b'head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested. i have,' b'however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont really' b'do what it says (i.e. run windows apps) os/2 will not run windows' b'apps in enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but' b'os/2 which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to. i have heard' b'that os/2 beta is available via ftp, and i was wondering if anyone knew' b'where to obtain a copy. i would appreciate any information, as i would like,' b'once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.' b'' b'-robbie<-' b'z_shererrg.sfasu.edu' b'' b'if you wait until may the 18th you will be able to buy the new os/2' b'2.1 since it will be released at comdex that day. it will run windows' b"3.1 apps and windows enh. mode. if you can't wait, then you can ftp a" b'6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is' b'probably a lot slower than the final product.' b'' b'when you do your test, please have in mind that a single tasking' b'system will always be faster at doing one task. the real power of os2' b"lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch." b'' b'happy benchmarking.' b'hans' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------' b'the whales of the atlantic and the people of the faroe islands' b'have coexisted in perfect harmony for the last years b'no matter what any urban navel contamplator without any real' b'relation to the coherence of the nature says.' b'-------------------------------------------------------------'
