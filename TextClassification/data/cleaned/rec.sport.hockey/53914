b'' b'' b'1993 world championships in germany:' b'====================================' b'' b'group a results:' b'' b'sweden canada b'' b'1st:' b'2nd: can geoff sanderson (kevin dineen) b'swe patrik juhlin (jan larsson) (pp)' b'3rd: can geoff sanderson (ps)' b'can mike gartner (greg johnson,adam graves) b"can rod brind'amour (shayne corson) b'' b'shots on goal: penalties: attendance: referee:' b'sweden 4*2min rob hearn (usa)' b'canada 6*2min' b'' b'bill ranford stopped shots to lead canada to a victory in a very well' b'played game.' b'' b'the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and' b"rundqvist came in alone on ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding" b'ranford. later on, kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom' b'played very well too. stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up' b'jan larsson but again ranford came up big. period ended scoreless but the edge' b'to sweden in creating more opportunities.' b'second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save. mark recchi' b'made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros, eric one timed the puck but' b'soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. at the 7-minute mark, canada' b"started applying pressure on the swedes. sanderson-dineen-brind'amour worked" b"hard and kept the puck in the swedes' zone. dineen gave the puck to sanderson" b'who skated around a screened swedish defenseman, came in on soderstrom and' b"made a wrist shot that went it by soderstrom's far post, canada." b'the swedes picked up their game after that, and peter forsberg had a shot' b"that hit ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out." b'then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play. jan larsson took' b'a shot from the slot, ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by' b'the far post, passed the puck and ranford was beat, b'third period started as the other periods, swedes having most of the pressure' b'but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal.' b'at canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to' b'cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it.' b"that resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in" b'the goal crease. geoff sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he' b"explained afterwards), and he put it low on soderstrom's stick side, close" b'to the post. excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal.' b'canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, gartner volleyed a' b'bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it the swedes ran out of gas' b"then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for periods." b"the goal came with only second left, rod brind'amour scoring on a" b'rebound from soderstrom, where the swedish defense already had their minds' b'in the dressing room.' b'' b'a very good game (the best in the wc so far?), with both goalies playing' b'great. soderstrom best player in sweden, but ranford even played better' b'than soderstrom, that tells you something about ranford. probably the best' b'goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.' b'canada played a very disciplined defense, ranford pointed out that it is' b'easy to play well with a good defense. lindros played a lot and played well,' b'sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.' b'' b"the forsberg-naslund-bergqvist line sweden's best along with larsson-juhlin-" b'nilsson. swedish defense played well, cm kg peter popovic had the' b'task of neutralizing cm kg eric lindros, and managed this very well.' b'ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc, and considering' b'that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game, he played very' b'well. swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because' b"of the swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake" b'on the goal.' b'' b'lines
