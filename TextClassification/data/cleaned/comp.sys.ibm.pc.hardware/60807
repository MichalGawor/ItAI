b'' b'' b'has anyone (successfully) put both scsi and ide hard drives' b'on the same system?' b'' b'i would like to know as well, since i just bought a 200mb seagate ide' b'drive and want to add it to my computer (a four-year-old gateway' b'386/20), which currently has an 80mb seagate scsi drive. the scsi' b'controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the cmos' b'setup, i.e. both hard drive settings are listed as "not installed,"' b'and apparently the scsi controller works its wonders. i wondering if' b'this is a problem. also, i remember how, when i helped my cousin' b'install his second ide drive, we had to define a master/slave' b'relationship for them; do i need to do something similar here?' b'' b'i am particularly interested in having the scsi as the _boot_ drive.' b'' b'same here.' b'' b'any help would be appreciated, since i intend to install this drive' b"asap; i'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) before i start." b'thanks!' b'' b'i have been using both ide (or mfm) and scsi drives for years. i have b'ide and scsi on one system and the other with ide, scsi disk, and' b'1 scsi cdrom. i currently using always in2000 scsi card, but i also have' b'a future domain, a western digital scsi card, and i work with an adaptic' b'before. as i recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.' b'however, to use with other controller (ide, mfm...) the boot drive has to' b'be the ide (or mfm). you can not boot from the scsi if you have other' b'controller in the system. if you guys only have drives ide, scsi).' b'just set up the ide in your cmos setup. make sure you can boot from it.' b'then, set up the scsi controller (irq, dma, etc). set the scsi drive to' b'id just plug and play for all the cards i seen so far. only if you' b'have more than drives then you need driver for the third drive and so' b'on. if you have more question, email me, i will try to answer it.' b'good luck!' b'' b'william' b''
