b'' b'...' b' mario is the michael jordan of hockey. all that fucker has to do is fall' b' on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least last night in the' b' 3rd game between nj and pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the' b' front of the goal while trying to get a shot off. the guy on him was' b' doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall' b' to the ice. then the fucking ref(van helloamend?) called the guy for' b' holding. they replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about' b' hockey) wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the nj player' b' had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him. it is simple,' b' mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic but the thing that' b" really pissed me off is, pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, i don't remember," b' on the resulting pp and' b' eventually won his diving/calls makes a huge difference in the' b' outcome of a game.' b'...' b' all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.' b'' b' steve' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'we must have been watching two different games. the devil had one hand on' b"mario's elbow and pulling the elbow caused mario to fall so the call was" b'appropriate.' b'' b"using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesn't give me a lot of" b'confidence in your call either. next time consider getting a second opinion' b'from a clueful observer. or maybe all those available disagreed.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'joseph stiehm' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
