b'=========================================' b'' b'' b'the ahmadiyya movement in islam, an international organi-' b'sation, was founder in in qadian, india. the founder of this' b'sect, hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad proclaimed to be the' b'promised reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major' b'religions of the world today (islam, christianity, judiasm, hin-' b'duism). he claimed to be the long awaited second comming of' b'jesus christ (metaphorically), the muslim mahdi, and the promised' b'messiah. he claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all' b'the great religions of the world about the advent of a messenger' b'from god have been fulfilled.' b'' b'the claims hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and' b'extreme oposition from many priestlike people of muslims, chris-' b'tians, jews and hindus of that age. such opposition is often wit-' b'nessed in the history of divine reformers. even today this sect' b'is being persecuted specially in some of the muslim regimes.' b'dispite the opposition and persecution, this sect has won many' b'adherents in countries. it has over million followers, who' b'come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.' b'' b'the sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing about' b'a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-' b'gions. its mission is to unite mankind into one universal broth-' b'erhood and develop a better understanding of faith. ahmadi' b'muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-' b'cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.' b'' b'among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-' b'tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-' b'ics in many third world countries. these institutions are staffed' b"by volunteer professional and are fully financed by the sect's" b'internal resources.' b'' b'the ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral' b'reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under' b'one universal religion.' b'' b'' b'newsgroup creation:' b'==================' b'' b'when the call for votes is called, the discussion will' b'officially end. voting will be held for about three weeks. if' b'the group gets 2/3rd majority and more "yes/create" votes' b'than "no/don\'t create" votes; the group shall be created. any' b'questions or comments may be included in the
