b'' b'greetings this is a general call for information regarding image' b'processing. i am looking for any material related to the field, and am' b'also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the' b'field. in particular source code for general use packages.' b'' b'i already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more' b"input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. i'm not" b"mathematically literate (ie. i don't have a degree in mathematics), so" b'any material that is suggested i would prefer that it was not' b'mathematically intensive.' b'' b'the best book i have found on the subject at the moment is:' b'' b'"practical digital image processing"' b'by rhys lewis' b'isbn: b'published by ellis horwood (c)1990.' b'' b'likewise i am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate' b"image processing techniques. so far i have 'xv', and 'khoros' for unix." b"'dcview for the ibm pc, and various related smatterings of c code" b'to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement' b'via convolution etc.' b'' b'if anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software' b'pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where i am' b'most likely to find it on the aarnet (internet). if i can i would prefer' b'source code in c or turbo pascal that includes some image processing' b'code/algorithms, that i can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of' b'demonstration it would be most helpful.' b'' b'all the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,' b'and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.' b'' b'' b'thanks in advance vance ashlin' b'diploma advanced computing' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------' b'thinking is dangerous, subversive, mindnumbing and leads you astray' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------'
