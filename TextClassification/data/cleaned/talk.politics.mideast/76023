b'' b'' b'*******************************************************' b'********************* to mr. napoleon******************' b'*******************************************************' b'' b' well, panos, mr. tamamidis?, the way you put it it is only the turks' b' who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. that is hard to' b' believe for somebody trying to be objective.' b' when it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot' b' blame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides.' b' what were you doing on anatolia after the ww1 anyway?' b' do you think it was your right to be there?' b'' b'** there were a couple millions of greeks living in asia minor' b'**until someone had to protect them. if not us who??' b'' b'' b'is that so? or you were taking advantage of weakness of ottoman' b'empire to grab some land. as soon as you got green lights from' b'allied forces, you occupied izmir and other cities in western' b'turkey. you killed and raped millions people without any reason.' b'of course, you paid the price. mustafa kemal ataturk made' b'you swim in aegean sea but not far enough. your aggressions thru' b'turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall' b'not get you anywhere.' b'' b'' b' i am not saying that conflicts started with that. it is only' b' not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.' b' it is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise.' b' i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the' b' visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey. i thought it' b' was a positive attempt to make the relations better.' b'' b'**compromise on what, the invasion of cyprus, the involment of turkey in' b'**greek politics, the refusal of turkey to accept miles of territorial' b'**waters as stated by international law, the properties of the greeks of' b'**konstantinople, the ownership of the islands in the greek lake,sorry, aegean.' b'' b'' b'what compromise are you talking about on cyprus. that is not greece' b'business to join the island to greece. that is up to people in the island' b'to live or not to live together. they made their decision and they are' b"living separetely now.there is a peace there. greeks can't slaughter" b'turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there.' b'your dream will never come true. mile territorialwater!!!!' b'are you joking or dreaming? we can declare our miles territorial' b'water which can come close to athens. how would you like it?' b"if you have any guts why don't you shoot at some turkish ships" b'in your dream mile territorial waters?' b'we do not have any city called konstantinople. we have a city' b'called istanbul!!!! all the greeks in istanbul are being' b'treated just any other turks. there is no difference among people' b'in turkey. you look at your own backyard first before talking' b'about human rights in turkey. what are the rights of turks in greece?' b'nothing. they do not even have basic human rights like right to' b'have property, fredom of religion, fredom of press, fredom of' b'vote elect their community leaders. government of greece publicly' b'encourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places,' b'houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. then, greek government' b'forces these minorities to go to turkey without anything with them.' b'you will dream to see aegean sea as greek lake but it will never' b'happen. think about the war between turkey and greece in b'the river called sakarya flood days filled with blood in b'' b'' b" the greeks i mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated" b' people. they have never met me but they know! i am bad person' b' because i am from turkey. politics is not my business, and it is' b' not the business of most of the turks. when it comes to individuals' b' why the hatred?' b'' b'**any person who supports the policies of the turkish goverment' b'**directly or indirecly is a "bad" person.' b'**it is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support' b'**of the actions of your goverment that make you "bad".' b'**people do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you' b'**are. you are a supporter of the policies of the turkish goverment and' b'**as a such you must pay the price.' b'' b'' b'you mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the' b'government of greece is a good person. that is your greek idea to' b'say turks are bad people. we know who we are and proud to be turks' b'anywhere in the world. that is not greeks business to tell us what' b'kind of people we are. you are not at position to judge people because' b'you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities.' b'millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen,' b'their rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under' b'the government of greece. they are almost being treated as slaves' b'even though we are getting into 21th century. therefore, do not make me' b'laught at you.' b'' b'' b' so that makes me think that there is some kind of' b' brainwashing going on in greece. after all why would an educated person' b' treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your' b' history books and things you learn about greek-turkish' b' encounters during your schooling.' b' take it easy!' b'' b'**you do not need brainwashing to turn people against the turks.just' b'**as greeks, arats, slavs, kurds and all other people who had' b'**the luck to be under turkish occupation.' b'**they will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction.' b'**you do not learn about turks from history books, you learn about' b'**them from people who experienced first hand turkish friendliness.' b'' b'the government of greece is actively supporting terrorism against' b'turkey.armenian and kurdish terrorists have headquarters in athens.' b'they are being trained in special camps in greece. they are taught how to' b'kill innocent women and children.this not a claim, this is a fact known' b'by whole world. in conlusion, you are in action to murder, rape,' b'destroy the innocent people. i do not take you seriously because you' b'are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity.' b'your own government, the government of greece actively supports' b"atrocities in bosnia. serbs's barbarism pleases your government." b'please napoleon think twice before you write anything about turks and' b'turkey. you are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of' b'the minorities. who wants to be a fried with someone whose government' b'does not respect the human rights, supports terrorism in turkey,barbaric' b'actions in bosnia, treats turkish minorities as third class citizen and' b'take away all of their rights, treating them as slaves at the beginning' b'of 21th century???????' b'' b'aykut atalay atakan' b'' b'napoleon'
