b'' b'i am desperately trying to find a pc based e-mail wide area network service' b'or the necessary network software to establish one myself. while i am aware' b"there are various bbs's and other similar services avalible (like compuserve," b'canada remote systems etc.) i require fairly specific criteria. in' b'approximate order of importance they are:' b'' b'1) the mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network' b'server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(note: all users are remote' b'and will use modems over conventional phone lines.)' b'' b'2) simple. the users i have for the system have very little computer knowledge' b'have never heard of unix, and have very little interest in learning. it is' b'essential that the client software is completely pain-free.' b'' b'3) cheap. we would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established' b'commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the' b'group hence in addition i would like the network server to be' b'something small, simple and inexpensive like a (there are only about' b'40 people in the group, so it is not a huge network.)' b'' b'4) the capability for internet access (for news/mail).' b'' b'' b'' b'if anyone knows of a system similar to what i am describing, even if it' b"doesn't sastisfy all my criteria, and i don't care where it is, please please" b'e-mail me and tell me about it. we are not adverse to making alterations to' b'an existing system if necessary.' b'' b'thanks.' b''
