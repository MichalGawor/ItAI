b'' b'i built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch' b"audio. i got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing switched. i was doing" b'most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and' b'nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.' b'' b'' b'my question is:' b'' b'\tis there a good relay/relay circuit that i can use for switching' b'audio, so that there will be *no* noise of any kind on the audio lines.' b'' b'' b'i will appreciate any advice or references to advice. also, exact part' b'numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!' b'' b'are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp' b'out level signals? also, are the clicks you mentioning the big' b'clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact' b'bounce? how are you driving the relays? ttl gate output? switching' b'transistor? how are the relays connected to what you are driving?' b'' b'need more specifics to answer your question!!
