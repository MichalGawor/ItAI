b'' b' the taste is hard to describe, although i remember it fondly. it was' b' most certainly more "candy" than say a modern "power bar." sort of' b' a toffee injected with vitamins. the chocolate power bar is a rough' b' approximation of the taste. strawberry sucked.' b'' b'' b"peanut butter was definitely my favorite. i don't think i ever took a second bite" b'of the strawberry.' b'' b'i recently joined nutri-system and their "chewy fudge bar" is very reminicent of' b'the chocolate space food. this is the only thing i can find that even comes close' b'the taste. it takes you back... your taste-buds are happy and your' b'intestines are in knots... joy!' b'' b'--' b'' b'mark b'|\thell! i don`t even agree with myself!' b'' b'"logic is a wreath of pretty flowers that smell bad."'
