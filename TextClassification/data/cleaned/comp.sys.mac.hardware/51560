b'' b"i've just completed a successful upgrade of a an si to mhz. i'm waiting" b'on delivery of a mhz clock for a final speed trial. definitely needed the' b'heatsink. the cpu was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until i glued' b'on a cent radio shack sink.' b'' b'i made a call for reports of failures last week. no reports have arrived' b'here. locally, in seattle there is a reported cpu damage due to the user' b'slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board not exactly' b'a problem due to the cpu running too fast.' b'' b'i think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system' b"configurations including pds and nubus cards which were used. i'd be happy" b'to coordinate and report results' b'' b''
