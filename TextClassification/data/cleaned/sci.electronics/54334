b'' b'i know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent i should' b'use to clean duct-tape adhesive from carpet?' b'' b'yet another suggestion, but this one is non-toxic (although i would handle' b'it like any other cleaner) and it smells nice. the chemical is called' b'd-limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (i think it is a lemon extract' b'of some kind). you might find it in a hardware store, sold as a' b'general-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store b'it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid. it works on sticker glue, crayons,' b'grease, oil, etc.' b'' b"it's clear yellow in the bottle, and you can use it straight; if you add" b'water, it changes to a creamy consistency, which is good for some jobs.' b'' b'peter'
