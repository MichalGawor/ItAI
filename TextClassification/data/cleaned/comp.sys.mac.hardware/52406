b'' b'' b'' b'hey all-' b'' b'we have an old external hd attached to the plus in our lab. it had' b'given us flawless service until last week. the problem: someone in our lab' b'has an old that was upgraded a couple years ago to a plus with an' b'aftermarket simm/scsi setup (digigraphics "simmer"). the db25 scsi plug runs' b'through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin' b'rectangular connector. well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,' b'to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the scsi plug. since the' b'26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside' b'down, essentially reversing the pins on the db25. he came in and asked if he' b'could try out our hd on his scsi port (it had never been used). naive fools' b'that we are, we said o.k.. his computer failed to recognize the drive. now,' b'none of the computers in our lab will recognize it. we tried disk doctor, and' b"it doesn't recognize anything on the scsi chain. could installing the scsi" b"upside down have wrecked the hd's driver board? the drive seems to spin up" b'all right and unpark itself upon powerup. the events are too coincidental to' b'attribute the problem to stiction.' b'' b'any help greatly appreciated-' b'' b'james'
