b'' b'' b'coaching news:' b'\t vasili tichonov (ex-assat) to san jose sharks' b"wow. so that's probably the reason why current assistant coach drew ramenda" b"hinted that he won't be back. thanks for the news, mikko; can you (or any" b'of our finnish netters) comment on tichonov?' b'' b'the first time i heard this piece of news was on the post game radio' b'interview here in jyvaskyla. that was the bronze medal game in the' b"sm-liiga which tichonov's team porin assat (the aces of town pori:)" b'lost. vasili, the son of victor tichonov (the famous soviet coach),' b'said that for a long time the sharks have been persuading him to' b'take the assistant coach post. but he wants to be the head coach where' b"ever he goes. he definitely won't be coaching assat anymore (after" b"three? seasons). i don't know why." b'' b'vasili is a good coach i believe. assat was a good team, produced many' b"players to our national team. assat wasn't a skilled team (imho) but" b'they had the fighting spirit. after all, they butchered jokerit in the' b"playoffs and gave hard time to tps, the champs. but assat wasn't" b'consistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any' b'team in the sm-liiga.' b'' b'i am not sure about the deal with the sharks. as i said, he wants' b'to be the head coach. but he and the sharks are going to negotiate and' b'decide during the wc. i doubt that he will be the head coach but' b"maybe they'll do some compromise." b'' b'could somebody post more information about vasili? i know he was coaching' b'in the former soviet league; teams, results? his character as a coach?' b''
