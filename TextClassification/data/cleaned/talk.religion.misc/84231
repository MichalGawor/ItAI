b'' b"i just started reading this newsgroup and haven't been following the" b"thread. i'm just curious: how did this thread get started with" b'"albert sabin" and changed into something else? what was it about' b'sabin that initiated a religious discussion?' b'' b'colin' b'' b'its just variation within a thread. the variation at times has been so great' b'that speciation has occurred. so albert sabin is the common ancestor of' b'several threads, some of which have themselves speciated. on a separate topic,' b'i subscribed to t.o. just recently. albert sabin existed at that time, so i' b'have no clue as to its origins. maybe the abiogenesists have an answer. i' b'might also point out that evolution is aimless. thus why albert' b'sabin evolved into a religious discussion is probably unexplainable.' b'' b'rich fox, anthro, usouthdakota'
