b'' b'' b'attn: those who live inthe philadelphia metro area...' b'' b'back in september i was listening to wip, and i remember the morning' b'guys were talking with mayor ed rendell. the topic of conversation' b'was a new ball park for the phillies. the location for this new park' b'was suggested to be near 30th st station. at the time, the mayor was' b'optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality. has' b'there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?' b'i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the' b'new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii. but it would be' b'nice to see this a reality. it is planned that the phillies leave' b"the vet and leave it solely to the eagles (and if that's the case," b"the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium, but that's another" b'story). i want to see that day!' b'' b'comments?'
