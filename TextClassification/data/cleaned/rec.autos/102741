b'' b'|' b'|' b'| while taking an extended easter vacation, i was going north on i-45' b'| somewhere between centerville, tx and dallas, tx and i came upon a' b'| train parked on a trestle with its locomotive sitting directly over' b'| the northbound lanes. there appeared to be movement within the cab' b'| and out of curiosity i slowed to to get a better look. just as i' b'| passed from underneath the trestle, my radar detector went into full' b'| alert all lights lit and all chirps, beeps, and buzzes going strong.' b'| i thought i had been nailed good but no police materialized.' b'|' b'| some, but not all, locomotives have doppler speedometers. the radar head is' b'| mounted looking down at the ground (to minimize intereference sent and' b'| received) but looking tangentally at a wheel. these are low power units' b"| and typically won't trigger radar detectors unless an unusual situation" b'| such as yours arises.' b'|' b'| john' b'|' b'| b'| john de armond, wd4oqc |interested in high performance mobility?' b'| performance engineering magazine(tm) interested in high tech and computers?' b'| marietta, ga send ur snail-mail address to' b'| need usenet public access in atlanta? write me for info on dixie.com.' b'' b'' b'this makes sense(radar pointed down), because almost every train i pass head-on that triggers' b'my radar detector does so more just after i have passed the front of the engine.' b'i get a little of the reflections as i am approaching and the instant i get to' b'the side of the first engine the detector receives a fairly strong signal for' b'a short time. it happens with just about every train i see.'
