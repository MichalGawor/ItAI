b'' b'' b'here is an annoying problem. whenever i save an icon which contains dark' b'colors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the' b'bright colors. this happens with every icon editor including the image' b"editor that came with sdk. i don't have this problem with .bmp files" b'either; only with .ico files or icon libraries. the problem is with' b'the icon colormap field in the icon file header. checking the file' b'with a binary editor, i can see that the masks are ok. by editing the' b"colormap manually (copying from another icon that i didn't edit) i can" b'fix the colors. does anybody know what may be causing this problem?' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'sadun anik, u of illinois at urbana-champaign' b'center for reliable and high-performance computing'
