b'' b'does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks' b'for sounding rockets?' b'' b'well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the' b'tanks big enough.' b'' b'our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a' b'telescope cluster, weighs around pounds. it uses freon jets for' b'steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie' b'during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much' b'continuously firing on a duty cycle or so...). the jets also' b'need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and' b'flip the payload around to look at the sun.' b'' b"we have two freon tanks, each holding liters of freon (i'm speaking" b'only from memory of the last flight). the ground crew at wsmr choose how' b'much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm. they have' b'extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.' b'' b'this should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas' b"quantity. if you really need to know, send me email and i'll try to get you" b'in touch with our ground crew people.' b'' b'cheers,' b'craig' b'' b'--' b"don't drink soap! dilute dilute! ok!"
