b'' b'' b"gerald, murray wasn't responsible for primeau (although i'm not" b"ready to admit that's a horrible pick). they hired him after the" b'draft (which has never made sense to me). his first pick was' b'lapointe.' b'' b'' b"i don't think primeau is necessarily a bad pick...i'm was just trying" b"to locate the beginning of murray's decisions...he slowness in trading" b"carson has delayed primeau's development...and you have to wait longer" b'for big players often...and primeau can be a very good player without' b'being a point-a-game-player, especially on a team that has yzerman and' b'fedorov...if primeau becomes joel otto, and gets goals a season,' b'and plays mean...it will have been an extremely good pick.' b'' b'gerald' b''
