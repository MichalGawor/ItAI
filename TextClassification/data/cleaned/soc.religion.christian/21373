b'' b' hello all,' b' i have a question about satan. i was taught a long time ago' b' that satan was really an angel of god and was kicked out of heaven' b" because he challenged god's authority. the problem is, i cannot" b' find this in the bible. is it in the bible? if not, where did it' b' originate?' b'' b"satan was one of god's highest ranking angels, like uriel, raphael," b'michael, and gabriel. in fact, his name was satanel. he did challenge' b"god's authority and got kicked out of heaven. a lot of the mythology" b'of satan (he lost the -el suffix when he fell) comes from the' b'book of enoch and is not found in the bible.' b'' b'read the book of enoch, available thru bookstores, or get the book' b'called "angels: an endangered species" (i think).' b'' b'' b'--' b"steven c. salaris we're...a lot more dangerous than live crew" b'we have ideas. we have a philosophy.' b'geoff tate queensryche'
