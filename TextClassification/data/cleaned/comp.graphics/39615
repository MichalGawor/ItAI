b'' b'' b'i was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the pc that' b'will do compositing of a series of pictures?' b'' b'what i mean by "compositing" is, say i have a live video clip' b'(digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated' b'bird flying around the screen. i want to combine these two series of' b'pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, i want' b'the living room picture to show through. yes, i realize i can do this' b'with a genlock, and i do own a genlock, but i want to be able to do' b"manual compositing also. it's ok if i have to composite one frame at" b"a time; i assumed i'd have to do that anyway. but being able to" b'composite a series of frames would be even better.' b'' b"i've looked around and i haven't found a pc package that will perform" b'this. help, please!'
