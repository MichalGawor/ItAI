b'' b'' b'hi all,' b'' b"due to living in the bay area, i as unable to see vancouver's victory over" b'the jets last night. i know the score, but that rarely describes the game.' b'could someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp?) of waht happened. how well' b'did each team play? were the cannucks deserving of the victory?' b'' b'' b'well, in my opinion the canucks played a really strong game. i was' b'especially pleased by a very strong game from linden i think he' b'could be a key to success for them this year. defensively, they' b"really had a strong game. hardly heard selanne's name all night." b'craven also played one of his best games since coming over. with a' b"few exceptions, they really didn't let the high-flying jets do much" b'high-flying. i thought the jets defence looked overmatched by the' b'canucks forwards they will have to improve on that if they want to' b'make this a series.' b'' b'in short, it was a great start!' b'' b'--'
