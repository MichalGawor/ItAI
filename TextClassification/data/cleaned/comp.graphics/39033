b'' b': has anyone else experienced anything like this? if this just means that i' b": need to replace the screen then i guess i'll have to but i thought that the" b': "death" of my lcd screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually' b": happened. i didn't want to take it in to be repaired before i asked on the" b': net about this because i already know what they\'ll say: "yep, you gotta have' b': this replaced and it\'s gonna cost you b'' b": i've only had the computer for about months." b'' b'"only"?!? that\'s a long time! (echoing above posting) the way the market' b"is going nowadays, your machine's obsolete two weeks before you buy it." b"sounds like you'll have to sink *some* money into it for repair, but" b"that's sometimes necessary for equipment." b'' b': is that a reasonable life' b': cycle for a lcd display?' b'' b'i think months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable. if' b'you had bought a compaq or toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the' b"machine to last longer before something went wrong; but that's a moot" b'point, perhaps.' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b''
