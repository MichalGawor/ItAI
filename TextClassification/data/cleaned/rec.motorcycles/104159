b'' b'' b" last year, i believe it was, jeff deeney posted what i've since come to" b" recognize as the ultimate april fools posting ever. it wasn't particularly" b' nice of him, as several people were quite fooled and very worried about' b" him, but i can't fault the effectiveness." b'' b'based on numerous inputs (most of them unprintable), i deemed it time for a' b"kinder, gentler, april not that i didn't have something really sick and" b'twisted ready to post perhaps next year.' b'' b'personally, i think jeffy-poo was still smarting more from the third degree' b'burns he suffered after april 1st last year rather than the supposed burns' b'that he suffered in "the joke". granted i was one of those people that were' b'taken in by it and i was certainly concerned...and then pissed at him for' b'pulling such a thing (which i made known to him).' b'' b'but then again, for an april fool "joke" i would also go on record as saying' b"that it was the best orchestrated one i've ever seen and it certainly sucked" b'a lot of people into believing it b'' b'"sick" "twisted"??? who in this group could ever be accused of such a thing?' b'' b'i tip my twisted lid to thee jeffy b'' b'' b'1977 triumph bonneville x b'"fear not the evil men do in the name of evil, but heaven protect' b'us from the evil men do in the name of good"'
