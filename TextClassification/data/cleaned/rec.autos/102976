b'' b'' b'dear netters:' b'' b"i am looking to buy a used eagle talon or tsi awd." b'' b'i would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was' b'maintained. i own a turbocharged one, and i would never buy a' b'turbocharged vehicle unless i knew the owner and his/her' b'driving/maintenance habits.' b'' b"question is that the tsi awd was mentioned in the" b'april consumer reports to a car to avoid!' b'' b"i have been wondering about that myself. the awd models and the" b"'91s were identical (except for the abs option)." b'' b'in particular, the manual transmission,' b'' b'yes. some owners had problems with the transaxles. using' b'synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most' b'cases. the problem was not unique to the awds, however. it was' b'common to all models. the galant vr4 and gsx had the same transaxle,' b"but i didn't see those listed in cr." b'' b'electrical system,' b'' b"i don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the" b'battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.' b'' b'and brakes were below par (in both models).' b'' b'the first fwd models (those built before may were recalled for' b'brake upgrades. some fwd and awd owners had problems with warped' b'rotors. those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every' b'time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.' b'' b'a friend of mine' b"ownes a tsi awd and he has had brake jobs (pads)," b'' b'i can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one' b'day! it all depends on how you drive. it seems that most owners have' b'been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.' b'' b'one stuck valve,' b'' b'first time i hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars,' b'other than timing belt failures.' b'' b'and some clutch/transmission problem, something' b"about sticking/grinding into second gear. this doesn't seem" b'too bad if one "beats" on his car.' b'' b'if your friend "beats" on the car, then his unit is not a' b"representative sample of the car's reliability." b'' b'my suggestion is instead of listening to the useless consumer reports,' b'talk to several owners (the mailing list may be the best way to reach' b'a few of them).' b'' b'i am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks. seems' b'you have to pay big buck if you want all three. anyway can' b'anyone please let me know how you like your talon, and any' b'problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.' b'' b'#if (humor_impaired) skip_to theend' b"no matter how much you pay, you won't get all three. examples:" b'' b'nsx: reliability and looks.' b'ferrari: reliability ^h^h^h^h^h^h (yeah, right!) speed and looks' b'' b'theend' b'--' b"the opinions stated above are not necessarily my employer's." b'----------------------------------------------------------------'
