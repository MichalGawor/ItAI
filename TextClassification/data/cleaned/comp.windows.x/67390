b'' b'hi there' b'' b"(i posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so i'm posting" b'here.)' b'' b"i'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for pcs into my workstation (an hp b'it is my understanding the x windows can understand a variety of input devices' b'including digitiser tablets. however, this digitiser makes use of the serial' b'port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.' b'' b'the hp manual pages say that the hp x server will accept x input from' b'devices listed in the /usr/lib/x11/x*devices file display number).' b"i shouldn't think i would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input" b"device in this file and expect a digitiser to work. but maybe i'm wrong. am i?" b'' b'what i would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected' b'to their workstation for use as a pointer for x (rather than just as input to a' b'specific x application)? if so, what were the steps required for installation?' b'did you need a special device driver? did the manufacturer supply it? are' b'there generic public domain device drivers around? (i understand that' b'digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)' b'' b'any help would be greatly appreciated.' b'' b'cheers' b'- vaughan' b'' b'--' b'engineering ph.d. student phone: b'& glider pilot\t\t\t fax: b'---------------------------------(_)---------------------------------'
