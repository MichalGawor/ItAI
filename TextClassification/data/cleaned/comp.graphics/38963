b'' b'' b'' b'' b' [moved on a bit]' b'' b'i wrote something about making color modifications quickly' b'with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file' b'process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.' b'this makes sense, because the main use of xv is only viewing images.' b'' b'doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications' b'in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,' b'we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.' b'' b'think about what you are saying here. the bit image is quantised down to b"bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. this" b'colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. you then want to apply these' b'modifications back to the bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped' b'to this one palette colour. ok you could do this by copying the bit file to a' b'32 bit file and using the extra bits to hold the index entry.' b'having done this, you need to do something to them what, exactly?' b'' b'apply the difference in rgb between the original and modified palette entry to' b'each colour in the group? this could generate colours with rgb outside the range' b'0...255. it would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth' b'colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.' b'' b'you could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how' b'far each colour was from the palette entry. however i suspect this would look' b'rather odd.' b'' b'so in summary, what i said in my previous posting still holds:' b'' b'how would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file? how' b"would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? only global" b'changes could be done unless the software were very different and' b'much more complicated.' b'' b'if you want to do colour editing on a bit image, you need much' b'more powerfull software which is readily available commercially.' b'' b'in other words, to edit a bit file you need software built for the job.' b'tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.' b'' b'as to the other bits you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in xv. if' b'that was not what you meant, then:' b'' b'(you propably misunderstood what i wrote as you have done in many' b'places so far.)' b'' b'yes, i probably did. i found that the collected digest format of your posting' b'made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. sorry' b'if i misunderstood.' b'' b'you also missed what is (were) wrong with xv. however, i did wrote it.' b'' b'yes again. what *is* (was?) wrong with xv?' b'' b'--' b'chris lilley' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'technical author, itti computer graphics and visualisation training project' b'computer graphics unit, manchester computing centre, oxford road,' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
