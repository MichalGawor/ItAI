b'' b'' b' actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talking' b'the other day about putting just one detector on one of the pluto satellites.' b'then we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like b'pounds of eq. well, a batse detector needs lead shielding to protect it,' b'and alone weighs about pounds itself.' b'' b'actually, the situation is even worse than that. the *total mass* of the' b'pluto fast flyby spacecraft is only 250ish pounds, and most of that is' b'support equipment like power and communications. the mass available for' b"instruments is maybe of that. i don't think a batse will fit..." b'' b'from the pluto fast flyby instrument definition research anouncemnet,' b'the instrument payload constraints are:' b'mass allocation kilograms lbs)' b'power allocation watts' b'required instruments:' b'visible imaging system (1024x1024 ccd, mm fl, f/10 optics)' b'ir mapping spectrometer (256x256 hgcdte array, energy resolution)' b'uv spectrometer nm, nm resolution)' b'radio science (ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system)' b'ultrastable means b'' b"this doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated" b'to the mission of the spacecraft. in addition, the power will come' b'from a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft will' b'be about feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will be' b'strong gamma-lines from pu-239 and associated schmutz in the' b'background, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.' b'' b'it would still be nice, and our group here at goddard is looking' b'in to it.' b'' b'--'
