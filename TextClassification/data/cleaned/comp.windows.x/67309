b'' b"i'm writing an x server for some video-generation equipment. the" b'hardware is "truecolor" in yuv space; in x terms it has a 24-bit' b'static color visual. i would really like to have the server just' b"present this static visual, but i'm not sure if this will be" b'acceptable to "most" x clients. the three problems i see are:' b'' b'1) the colormap, though huge, is static.' b'2) all pixels would be bytes wide.' b'3) because the hardware actually lives in yuv space, the' b'translation rgb-yuv will introduce some rounding error.' b'' b'being more of a server guy than a client guy, i ask: will these' b'limitations thwart many x clients? or will most of the x stuff' b"floating around blithely accept what they're given? i could write" b'the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., bits,' b"but i'd rather avoid this if not necessary." b'' b"i know there are no absolutes, but i'd appreciate hearing people's" b'opinions and suggestions. thanks!' b'' b'--' b'frederick g. m. roeber cern european center for nuclear research' b'r-mail: cern/ppe, geneva switzerland home:
