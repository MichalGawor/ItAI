b'' b'' b'over the years, i have met christians who are not associated with' b'any local church and are not members of any local church. this is' b'an issue that may be very personal, but is important. what does' b'the bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with' b'regard to this issue?' b'' b'this brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much,' b'and probably has not been studied much.' b'' b"as some of you may be aware, i've posted a lot of articles lately on" b'personality typing (of which the mbti is a test vehicle). to come up' b"to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by" b'personality type summary file.' b'' b'one observation is that people have significantly different personalities' b'(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born. with respect' b'to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while' b'other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more' b'solitary and contemplative lifestyle that is, they are de-energized if' b'confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of' b'people. of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.' b'' b'my impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and' b"create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted" b'(there are many introverted characters in the bible, btw). i know, i am' b"quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches" b'to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very' b'uncomfortable. knowing what i know now, these churches have been overly' b'influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.' b"(btw, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both" b'preferences have their place in the body).' b'' b'maybe i should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words' b'are usually not used correctly in our culture. the extrovert/introvert' b'scale is a measure of how a person is energized. the following is' b'excerpted from my summary:' b'' b'1. energizing how a person is energized:' b'' b'extroversion (e)- preference for drawing energy from the outside' b'world of people, activities or things.' b'' b"introversion (i)- preference for drawing energy from one's internal" b'world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.' b'' b'' b'hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can' b'structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise' b"the body of christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities" b"to fit them into a particular framework. i'm sure there are other aspects" b'of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among' b'their members to the detriment of all.' b'' b'jon noring' b'' b'--' b'' b'charter member infj club.' b'' b"if you're dying to know what infj means, be brave, e-mail me, i'll send info." b'=============================================================================' b"| jkn international ip fred's gourmet chocolate b"| carlton place phone chips world's best! b'| livermore, ca v-mail: b'=============================================================================' b"who are you? read alt.psychology.personality! that's where the action is."
