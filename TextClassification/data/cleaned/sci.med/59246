b'' b'-*----' b' of course, they are working on the theory that candida' b' overbloom with penetration into mucus membrane tissue with' b' associated "mild" inflammatory response can and does occur' b' in a large number of people. if you reject this "yeast' b' hypothesis", then i\'d guess you\'d view this research as one' b' more wasteful and quixotic endeavor. stay tuned.' b'' b'i do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion' b'one way or another on hidden candida infections. i can' b'understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with' b'various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid' b'demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.' b'(to understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past' b'failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of' b'hidden candida infection. there have been quite a few, and the' b'proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)' b'' b'on the other hand, i am happy to read that some people are' b'sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by' b'suggestive clinical experience, to research it further. the' b'doubters may be surprised. (it has happened before.)' b'' b'i realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may' b'not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or' b'another.
