b'' b'' b"as long as we're trading secrets, let me tell y'all one: i got a" b'really bad feeling in my heart back when i was a christian. i' b"couldn't really pinpoint it, but something felt dreadfully cheap and" b'wrong about the whole affair. i had been a devout follower, even a' b'bible-banger, but eventually it started ringing terribly hollow to me.' b'' b'and i felt torn when i began to disagree with a lot of what the bible' b'(and my priests) told me; this was what made me finally realize that' b'either i was very wrong, or else the bible was very wrong. and since' b'i felt reasonably sure of myself, i decided to start analyzing the' b'bible very closely. that was the catalyst to my break with my faith,' b'though it was a long and difficult effort.' b'' b'brian, have you checked out what your priests told you in the' b'bible to see whether they were telling you the truth? did you know' b"that according to the bible, there shouldn't even be such things as" b'"priests" anymore? do you know why the preisthood was established in' b'the old testament to begin with and the reasons why after jesus,' b'there were no priests--that is until the roman catholic church' b'300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring' b'the whole concept beyond the book of hebrews?' b'' b'you said you analyzed the bible very closely. i think you are' b'lying. for if you had, i would think you would have at least' b'got the doctrine of hell straight.' b'' b'so what is your beef against jesus? be specific and point on' b'verses.'
