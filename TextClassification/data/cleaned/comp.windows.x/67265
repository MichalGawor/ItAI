b'' b'' b'i have a togglebutton widget (yes widget) and i have a routine' b'which changes the color of the foreground and background of the' b'label. well, the background changes alright, but the label' b'text does not redraw itself.' b'' b'i am guessing that i have to force it to redraw with an' b'xexposeevent sent to it via xsendevent. is this the best' b"way to get the text up again? i can't seeem to get" b'xsendevent to work right.... if this is a good approach,' b'might anyone have an example lying around to show me how to' b"do this? i've rtfm all evening and did not find a decent" b'example.' b'' b'ps i keep getting segmentation faults in xsendevent, tho all' b'the values are as expected.' b'' b'thanks in advance' b'' b'stephen m. dahmen' b''
