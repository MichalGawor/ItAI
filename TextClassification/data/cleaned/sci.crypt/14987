b'' b'' b'[lots of stuff.]' b'' b'i hate to follow up to my own posting, but i should perhaps clarify' b"some things so i won't get flamed." b'' b"first of all, when i'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a" b"``breakthrough in factoring'', what i really mean is a breakthrough in" b'the cryptanalysis of rsa. i know that factoring and breaking rsa are' b"not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to" b'repeat this every time.' b'' b"i also have to admit that i don't really know if the ``non-group''" b'property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining. i have' b"thought about it a little while, but i can't find a way that a" b'cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure. that, of course, means' b'nothing at all.' b'' b'then i wrote,' b'' b'please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a rsa modulus' b'than it is to generate it, the increase in computer speed alone will' b'keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step, i.e., people will' b'simply start using longer moduli and still be safe.' b'' b'what i meant was that as long as the only advantage of the' b'cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have rsa for' b'a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be' b'broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people' b'would simply use longer moduli. both users and cryptanalysts benefit' b'from better technology in the same way.' b'' b'hope this keeps the flames away... have fun.' b'' b'--' b'sig closed for inventory. please leave your pickaxe outside.' b'pgp public key available on request. note the expiration date.'
