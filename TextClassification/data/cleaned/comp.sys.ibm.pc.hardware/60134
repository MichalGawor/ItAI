b'' b'' b'in the latest pc magazine (pentium isssue), there' b'is an editorial on the' b'advantages of a pc using eise/vesa-lb rather' b'than just plain isa/vesa-lb. supposedly users' b'will eventually want more than 16mb of ram.' b'however since the isa bus has only bits,' b'then anything on the bus can access only 16mb' b'even if i have 32mb on the motherboard.' b'so far i agree with the arguments.' b'' b'then the writer claims that glitches can' b'occur in systems with over 16mb because' b"of that limit. that part i don't understand" b'because the ram is right on the motherboard.' b'so the cpu should have no problems talking' b'with the ram. can anybody explain this b'' b'the problem is with isa bus-masters which' b'can only address the first 16mbs of system' b'memory. bus-masters do not use the cpu' b'nor the system dma to do the actual data' b'transfer but transfer their data directly' b'to the system ram.' b'' b'rp93' b'--'
