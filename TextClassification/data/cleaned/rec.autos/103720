b'' b'' b'' b"i'm not familiar with the trannies used in winston cup, but in the trans-am" b"cars i've played with the transmissions were the racing variety, with" b'dog clutches instead of sychros. in a transmission with dog clutches, the' b'gears are always engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches' b'engages the gears to the shafts. motorcycle transmissions are the same way.' b'shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause' b'transmission damage, the only question being how long it takesto grenade' b'something (for the trans in my pulsar se, it was about 3-5k miles, but' b'it had a weak tranny in the first place).' b'' b'just out of curiosity, how is this "dog clutch" any different from a synchro' b'transmission. what you described sounds the same to me. in fact, what little' b'i\'ve studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs"' b'and said they were synonymous. the gears are always meshed in a synchronized' b'gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. or at least,' b'that is what i was taught. explain, por favour?' b'' b'thanx' b'drew' b"ps email's fine if this is inappropriate for here, or if i'm the only bonhead" b"who doesn't know the diff."
