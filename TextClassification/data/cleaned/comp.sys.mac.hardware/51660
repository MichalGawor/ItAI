b'' b'' b' we are doing heavy duty image processing with some seriously' b" underpowered mac's (mac iisi, for example). most of the cpu time is" b" burned in doing fft's." b'' b' what cards are out there which would allow us to take away that part' b' of the load from the cpu? any dsp or i860 cards out there,' b" for example? they'd have to be callable from think pascal, to" b" replace the one and two dimensional fft's routines in an already" b' existing program.' b'' b'check out the national instruments nb-dsp2300. this uses the texas' b"instruments tms320c30 chip, which is a true bit floating point dsp. it's" b'pricey, however.'
