b'' b'' b'' b" say you're in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody." b' you give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in' b' their action anyway and you end up shooting and killing them. my' b' question is what do you do? should you stay and wait for the cops' b" or should you collect your brass (if you're using a semi-auto) and" b" get out of there (provided of course you don't think that you have" b' been seen)? what kind of laws are on the books regarding this type' b' of situation? what would be the most likely thing to happen to you' b' if you stayed and waited and it was a first offense? what would' b' happen if you took off but someone saw you and you were caught?' b'' b"ghods. do you have -any- idea how much trouble you'd get into for" b'taking off like that? leaving the scene of an auto accident is bad' b"enough! killing someone leaving is times worse. who's going" b'to seriously believe it was self-defense when you took the time' b'to collect your spent casings? "but officer, i reload!"' b'' b'well, like someone said in a reply to this it really all depends on the area' b"that you live in. see david veal's reply to this. i have heard exactly the" b'same thing that he said in his reply to fade away if you think that you' b"haven't been seen (i heard this from a police officer). for the record though" b'he was talking about in tennessee not everywhere.' b'' b"even if you could get away with it, you're still a fugitive. do" b'it nice legal, keep your law-abiding status send your story' b'into the armed citizen column of american rifleman.' b'' b'jason' b'' b'--' b'' b'' b'' b''
