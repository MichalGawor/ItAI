b'' b'would someone be kind enought to document the exact' b"nature of the evidence against the bd's without reference to" b'hearsay or newsreports. i would also like to know more about' b'their past record etc. but again based on solid not media' b'reports.' b'' b'my reason for asking for such evidence is that last night' b'on larry king live a so-called "cult-expert" was interviewed from' b'australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the' b'original raid. this admission, if true, raises the nasty' b'possibility that the government acted in good faith, which i' b'believe they did, on faulty evidence. it also raises the' b'possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising' b'them and giving ver poor advice.' b'' b'a few years ago anson shupe and david bromley published' b'strange gods: the great american cult scare (beacon, boston, b'- and the new vigilantes: anti-cultists and new religions -sage,' b'beverly hills, both books suggested the possibility of' b'tragic results if self-proclaimed cult experts were ever taken' b'seriously. perhaps their diagnosis of the anit-cult movement' b'needs investigating in light of the waco tragedy.'
