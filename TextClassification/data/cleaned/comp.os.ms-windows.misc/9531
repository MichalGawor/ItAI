b'' b'hi all,' b'' b'does anyone know if there is a good sound formats conversion program out' b'' b'there??? (like paintshoppro for picture formats conversion)' b'' b'please send me a copy of your reply!!!' b'' b'thanks a lot' b'' b'bel' b'' b'' b'hi...' b'' b"the best sound conversion program i've ever seen is soundtool, which" b'is shareware from germany. i found a copy somewhere in wuarchive.wustl.edu' b"a long time ago, but i don't know offhand what directory it was under. it's" b'great at converting files of all types, including mac, next, sun, and' b"various pc formats... it's also a great player and editor, with various" b"special effects that put windows' sound recorder to shame. it requires a" b'driver for various sound cards... the only builtin one is for the pc speaker' b"(and even that sounds pretty good), but if you're just using it to convert" b'things, you can convert them in soundtool and then play them in sound' b'recorder.' b'' b'give it a try!' b'' b'bret' b'--'
