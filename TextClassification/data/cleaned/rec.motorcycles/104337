b'' b': i am in the market for a bike and have recently found a b': honda vrf at a dealership. the bike has about miles' b': and is around it has had two previous owners, both employees' b': of the dealership who, i have been told, took very good care of the' b': bike.' b'' b': i have two questions: is this too many miles for a bike? i know this' b': would not be many miles for a car but i am unfamiliar with the life' b': span of bikes. is this a decent price? i am also unfamilar with' b': prices for used bikes. is there a blue book for bikes like there is' b': for cars?.' b'' b': thanks for any advice you can give.' b'' b': --mark' b'--' b'' b'mark,' b'' b'47k is not too many miles on a vfr750. i sold my (well maintained)' b"'87 vfr700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition." b'all that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings' b'and seals. the guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers' b'to look at the top end, do a compression check etc. he confirmed it was' b'mint.' b'' b"as for price, seems a little steep. i bought my with 12k" b'miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for b'there is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.' b"i've seen a couple of ads for vfr's in the dollar range. they all" b"said low miles mint condition but i didn't actually go look at them." b'' b'a vfr is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain' b'it at all. one thing to look for, btw, is a soft front end. if my' b'vfr is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.' b'progressive springs fixed it right up.' b'' b'good luck,' b'' b'_______________________ k e n b'| b'| ken snyder ms/loc: un2 b'| hewlett-packard co. lsid lake stevens instrument div. b'| soper hill road gte/tn: b'|______________________________________________________________|'
