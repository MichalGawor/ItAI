b'' b'hi,' b'i am looking an integrated circuits for my z80-based' b'computer.' b'the circuit is called z80-sti (serial timer interrupt),' b'mk3801, and' b'made by mostek. mostek is called sgs thompson today.' b'' b'i have been in contact with sgs thompson, unfortunately' b'they me told that z80-sti is obsolete.' b'' b'so, my question is if anyone know if i can get hold of that' b'circuits. are there any companies that specialize in selling' b'circuits that are no longer in production? i have contacted' b'several electronic brokers in' b'sweden, but without any success. i would appreciate if you' b'could give me hint where i should continue looking. even' b'companies in the united states would be fine, since this' b'circuit is pretty crucial to me.' b'' b'' b'thanks in advance.' b'' b'' b'thomas thor' b'royal institute of technology' b'stockholm, sweden' b''
