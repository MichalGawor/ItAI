b'' b' i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my ninja.' b" this will be the the first time i've taken anyone for an extended ride" b" (read: farther than around the block we'll be riding some twisty," b' fairly bumpy roads (the mines road-mt.hamilton loop for you sf bay areans).' b'' b" this person is lbs. and fairly small, so i don't see weight as too much" b' of a problem, but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go?' b'' b"my fiancee' and i do quite a bit of sporty riding 2-up. i'll tell you" b"what we've found and the systems we've worked out." b'' b"- on starts, accelerate much slower than usual. it's tough for the rider" b"to judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something" b'and leaning forward. remember this.' b'' b'- on turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally' b"this means she isn't leaning at all.) it's very disconcerting to be leaned" b"over and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up." b'much balance is lost and this can be dangerous.' b'' b"- on slowing and stopping, do so much slower than usual. again, it's tough" b"for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding" b"onto something and leaning forward. however, you'll figure it out fast" b'because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which' b'shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.' b'' b'- generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not' b'out wide. this helps balance and gives her somegrip.' b'' b'- when you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.' b'normally this means "slow down, and do it now!".' b'' b'' b' turning so she leans *with* me, but what else? are there traditional' b' signals for slow down!! or go faster!! or i hafta go pee!! etc.???' b'' b'we only have a couple signals. "slow down" is her either tapping me on' b'the back, or slapping my helmet with all her might. depends on the urgency' b'of the matter b'' b'"turn here" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit. this is' b'also the sign for "cool! look at that." "i hafta pee" is the same sign' b'as "turn here". "i\'m hungry" is the same sign. "go faster" is usually' b'done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee. i usually see "slow' b'down" more often than "go faster".' b'' b' i really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that' b" she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated..." b'' b'the best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and' b"pillion on his or her bike. it's incredibly frustrating, because you're" b'in almost no control. now, multiply that feeling times ten, because' b'you as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely' b"feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes" b'at any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.' b'pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.' b'' b"also, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up" b"than by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and" b'"in the zen of the moment" less. remember this.' b'' b'----------------------------------------------------' b'dod ama, vme, dioc, 1ksi=2.53' b"'91 vfr750f, nighthawk seca turbo" b'^^^ for sale' b'----------------------------------------------------'
