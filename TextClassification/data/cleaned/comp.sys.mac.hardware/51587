b'' b'i just recently bought a mb ram card for my original mac portable' b'(backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. it happens when i put' b'the machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just' b'freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset' b'switch. other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error' b'message of "co processor not installed".' b'' b'i know one solution is not to put the machine to sleep, but does anyone' b'have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix' b'it? the memory card is psuedostatic ram and goes into the pds slot. that' b'probably figures into the problem. the manufacturer is king memory (not' b'kingston) from irvine, ca. they say the problem is in my machine.' b'' b'any ideas? gene wright.' b'' b'--' b'------------jackatak.raider.net
