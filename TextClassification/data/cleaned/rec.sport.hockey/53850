b'' b' (thanks for the goals by steve smith)' b" i don't see why more people don't blame grant fuhr for the goal that smith" b" put in his own net, it's common to play the puck back to your own goalie when" b' deep in your own end and under little or no pressure from the offensive team.' b' if fuhr had been in position the puck would have never crossed the line.' b'' b"from this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, mike. smith" b'came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit fuhr in the' b'back of the leg. fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what' b"happened. the puck went straight off fuhr's leg and into the net. fuhr never" b'had a chance. there was no play back to the goaltender, in fact perry berezan' b'of calgary had just dumped it in and smith was retrieving it.' b'' b'it was unfortunate that it happened; smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie' b'at the time, and on his birthday too. but all the blame lies with him. starting' b'in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of' b'their own net. too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the' b'goaltender, or whatever.' b'' b'and to the people who say that smith cost the oilers the series, i can only' b"say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games." b'there was no reason for a powerhouse team like edmonton to be tied late' b'in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. everybody on the team' b'has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.' b'' b'alan'
