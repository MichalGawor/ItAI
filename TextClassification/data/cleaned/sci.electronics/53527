b'' b"i'm wanting to build a simple ups for my pc. sustain the computer long enough to complete" b'the current task and save, to minutes should be enough....' b"i think, though i don't really need to keep the monitor active (i can try to" b'remember what to do) so maybe i can avoid a dc-ac inverter and just use a' b'battery to directly supply the motherboard and peripherals.' b'' b"now there's a good idea all you need is amps dc for a few minutes, and" b'a good (wetware) memory (was i using wp or autocad or i thought of the' b"same idea myself a few days ago. i've got a fairly new car battery that i take" b"along in my 4x4 when i go camping, and it sits around useless when i'm home." b'i wish i could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy' b"duty 5-volt regulator to supply the pc. but i guess you'd need -5v and -12v" b'(and too more batteries b'' b'an alternative would be to leave a amp battery charger hooked up to the battery' b'and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power' b'goes out, voi-la the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery and' b'then i could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips b'' b'' b'--' b'fax concurrent processing devices group, jet propulsion' b'laboratory, m/s oak grove dr, pasadena ca usa'
