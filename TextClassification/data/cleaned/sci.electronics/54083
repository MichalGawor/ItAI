b'' b'' b' i was just wondering one thing, actually two. i hope that this is' b'the' b' proper place to post this subject)' b'' b' why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally' b'unuseable)' b' when stored on a concrete floor?' b' i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the' b'motorcycle' b' from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and i just' b' went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but' b' they act like the two terminals are shorted. i asked a friend' b" and he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them," b" but he couldn't tell me why." b'' b' thanks' b'' b'' b'what happens is that (i heard this discussed on "northern exposure") there' b'is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the' b'molecules in the concrete. this acts as an attractant to ufos (actually' b'their crew members) and they arrive at the scene of the battery/concrete' b'combination.' b'' b'then they proceed to suck all the energy out of the batteries!' b'' b'remedy: set the battery on a nonconcrete floor.' b'' b'jack'
