b'' b'i have found a kit advertised for lowering the front end of an early' b'mustang. installation envolves moving the upper a-arm and installation' b'of a wedge shaped spacer between the a-arm and ball joint. apparently,' b'shelby mustangs did a similair modification, but left out the spacer.' b'' b'i would be interested in feedback, pro or con, on such a modification.' b'' b"i'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple" b'strut suspension (that is, with no upper a-arm)? just a strut' b'going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an a-arm), with a' b'tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?' b'' b'anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using' b'shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening' b'the strut below the perch. in each of these cases, the suspension geometry' b'will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the' b'intended angle. a spacer placed between control arm and the bottom' b'of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore' b'the suspension geometry. imho, the kit that includes the spacer' b'is the only way to go...' b'' b'--ken' b'--' b'ken r. dye\t\t\t\tan optimist is a guy\t\t b'lachman technology, inc., chicago\tthat has never had\t\t b'(708) x341\t\t\tmuch experience\t\t\t
