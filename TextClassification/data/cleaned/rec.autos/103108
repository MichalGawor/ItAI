b'' b'i just ordered a saturn sl1 after considering a few imports. frankly, the saturn' b"way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. i hadn't bought a new" b"car since i bought my honda 4wd back in and i was unbelieveably offended by" b'most salespeople i met.' b'' b'saturn was indeed very different. i made three different visits to the dealer where' b'i bought my car, and was never pressured. saturn also had the best after-sales' b'support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what' b'i wanted to buy. another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the' b"dealer. he's been fixing imports for years...and bought a saturn, based on" b"what he's seen and heard from his customers." b'' b'saturn also has a good extended warranty program; for year/60k miles,' b"fully refunded if you don't use it. that works out to an actual cost of or" b"so, based on the year treasury rates. using savings account rates it's more" b'like in the first three years it also buys you free rental during any' b'warranty work, without counting against the refund.' b'' b'--mike' b'' b''
