b'' b' henry, if i read you correctly, you may be asking "if i put a blackbody' b"in interstellar space ('disregarding the sun and nearby large warm objects')," b'what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient' b'radiation field?"' b'' b'basically the right question, although i was interested in cases closer' b'to home where the sun is behind either a natural object or effective' b'shielding.' b'' b" if that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and" b'molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far' b'from being blackbodies...' b' inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bit' b'from place to place...' b'' b'good point (and thanks for the references).' b'--'
