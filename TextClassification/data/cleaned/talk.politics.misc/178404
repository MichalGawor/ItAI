b'' b'' b'there is never any mention of how much working canadians have to' b'pay in taxes for their "free" health care system.' b'' b'oh, *really*???' b'' b"i know that more than of an average daily worker's salary goes" b'towards taxes in canada mainly because of this "free" health care.' b'it looks like we are pretty lucky so far.' b'' b'i know that when working in alberta, ontario and quebec, i was aware' b'that i was paying for health insurance e.g., in toronto, ohip fees' b'were listed seperately on my pay stub.' b'' b"while i'm not the only canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks" b"in spending, health insurance isn't on the table. see our polls b'a better one might be the july 1st polls conducted for macleans (our' b'major english newsmagazine) by decima research decima president' b"allen gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers," b"and mulroney's conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in" b"the face of impossible election situations. i haven't had a chance" b"to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones" b'before the americans started their assault and disinformation had' b'shown satisfaction at and switching to an american all-private' b'system had support within statistical noise. the decima polls are' b'considered definitive. even the new reform party, a breakoff of' b'traditionalists from the conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"' b'faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that' b"just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average" b'canadian/european is more fiscally naive than their american' b'counterparts on issues like these).' b'' b'personally, i feel that the universal health insurance approach used' b'in canada, france and germany paying to private health providers in' b"a nominally free market not unlike america's, minus hmo's depends a" b'lot on values in those societies different from the u.s. the basic' b'health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does' b'allow the market to address that basic health care is not viewed on' b'the level of ownership of a vcr as americans would see it. plenty of' b'room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as' b'' b'lastly, there were noises about how the canadian system was not' b'containing costs, but, in fact, their system is currently bankrupt.' b'' b'please explain this one, hopefully in a way that canadian readers' b'besides myself can understand and concur b'' b'gld' b'--' b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ je me souviens b'gary l. dare'
