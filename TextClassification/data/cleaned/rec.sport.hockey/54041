b'' b'felix potvin deserves to have the sh&$ kicked out of him. if there is anyone' b"that he should be hitting with his stick, its his pussy defensemen who can't" b'seem to move big dino ciccerelli lbs) out from in front of the net.' b'' b'obviously toronto has realized that they are overmatched by the wings and must' b'rely on trying to antagonize the superior red wings with cheap shots. i prefer' b'to watch hockey than seeing shots of felix potvin slashing and spearing dino' b'ciccerelli standing in front of the net. he has every right to stand in' b'front of the net, just not in the crease!' b'' b"yes, he does. but, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there! when" b'i played roller hockey (boy do i miss those days) as a goalie, i would' b"scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot. i don't care if he's" b'in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so i can see the ball!' b'(yes, roller hockey, remember) and if there was nobody around to clear' b"the slot, then i'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*." b"i *hate* people in my way when i'm the goalie, and i am sure felix does" b"too. i should say that i didn't see the incident, so if potvin really" b"swung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people" b"out of the way. he's a player on the ice too, you know. b'' b'--' b"keith keller\t\t\t\tlet's go rangers!!!!!" b"in this corner\t\t\t\tlet's go quakers!!!!!" b'weighing in at almost every weight imaginable b'life, and all that surrounds it.\t\t blues traveler,
