b'' b'' b' robert, you keep making references to "orthodox" belief, and saying things' b'like "it is held that..." (cf. "kermit" thread). on what exact body of' b'theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?" who is that "holds' b'that" luke meant what you said he meant? whenever your personal interpretation' b'of biblical passages is challenged, your only response seems' b'to be that one needs merely to "look at the bible" in order to see the truth,' b'but what of those who see biblical things differently from you? are we to' b'simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it?' b' just curious,' b'--' b'' b'' b'when robert refers to the "orthodox", he is talking about the historical' b'position of the christian faith. such things are derived from biblcal' b'texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.' b'' b'you are right that people read things differently in the bible, and this' b'is alright in parts like parables and such forth. however, when it comes' b'to the essential doctrines of the historical orthodox christan beliefs,' b'there is only one correct way to read it. for example, either the' b'doctrine of the trinity is true, or it is false. yes, people read the' b'texts differently, but only one position is true. they both cannot be.' b'according to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.' b'' b'therefore, when people like joseph smith come along with a vision and' b'thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the' b'bible, people consider him a cult.'
