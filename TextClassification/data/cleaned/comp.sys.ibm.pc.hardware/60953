b'' b'' b' have anybody succeded in converting a atari monomchrome monitor into a' b' mono vga monitor. if so please let me know exactly how you did and what' b' graphics card you used.' b'' b' i wish i could help! i posted a similar question about two weeks ago;' b" i got no response at all. i've asked locally at my friendly atari store." b' i was told that it should be possible, but that they had no idea how' b' it might be done. nor did they particularly care to investigate.' b'' b"ok, here's my results so far...." b'' b"1: you have to define the monitor as lcd it doesn't really support" b"analogue video input (it works, but isn't very linear...)" b'' b'2: the incoming sync pulses need inverting. this is best achieved' b'with either a cmos xor package or a transistor inverter.' b"if you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. b'' b"3: it'll only work in standard vga mode." b'' b"ok, having said that, i'm trying to either find a circuit or ic" b'which will act as a universal sync decoder.' b'' b'i want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync' b"pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting" b'the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.' b'' b'there are reasons for doing this' b'' b"1: vga cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're" b'in herc emulation is while mvga is for example.' b'' b"2: it means i don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the" b'monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my' b'ibm. currently i have (yes, monitors sitting on my desk,' b'and i want to get that number down as much as possible.' b'being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white vga' b'will cut things down to if i forget about atari colour,' b'i can get down to b'' b'ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,' b"but i'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait..." b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'alan brown' b''
