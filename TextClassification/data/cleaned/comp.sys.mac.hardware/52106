b'' b'hello,' b'' b'we need the code for decompression of quicktime jpeg pict files, as they' b"don't conform to usual jpeg compressors, which are available in source." b'the code should be in c pascal or modula. the code will be used on several' b'platforms to view pictures over isdn. perhaps a special hardware will be' b'put around it (much less then a mac! perhaps only a dsp with some support' b'chips)' b'if the code is not available, perhaps the algorithm is available to' b'decompress' b'them.' b'' b'christian bauer' b''
