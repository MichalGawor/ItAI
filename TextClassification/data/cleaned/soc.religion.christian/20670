b'' b'[""= mark, mp]' b'' b" i'm concerned about a recent posting about wbt/sil. i thought they'd" b'pretty much been denounced as a right-wing organization involved in' b'ideological manipulation and cultural interference' b'' b'good heavens, you mean my good friend wes collins, who took his wife and two' b'small children into the jungles of guatemala, despite dangers from primitive' b'conditions and armed guerillas, so that the indigenous people groups their' b'could have the bible in their native languages--the young man who led bible' b'studies in our church, who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding' b'faith in the lord of love--you mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic *spy*' b'' b'i am sorry you find these charges amusing, mark. i understand your' b'frustration though--it can be kind of scary to find your assumptions' b'challenged. some of the specific cultural interference to which i refer' b'includes linguistic manipulation, for instance, their tzotzil-spanish' b'dictionary removed both spanish and tzotzil words for concepts which are' b'threatening to the ruling ideology, e.g., class, conquer, exploitation,' b'repression, revolution, and described words which can express' b'ideological concepts in examples like "boss--the boss is good. he treats' b'us well and pays us a good wage." as some of my students would say,' b'"not!"' b'your tone implies that you are unlikely to believe me--indeed, why' b'should you? if you are interested enough to do some further research' b'though, and you sound as if you are, here are some references for you.' b'' b'stoll, david. _fishers of men or founders of empire? the wycliffe bible' b'translators in latin america_.' b'_sectas y religiosidad en america latina_.' b'_los angeles times_, dec. b'_latin america press_, may b'_washington times_, june b'' b'happy hunting.' b'' b'mp'
