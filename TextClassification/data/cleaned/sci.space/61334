b'' b'batse, by having detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,' b'but only to within about degrees (would someone at gsfc, like david, like' b'to comment on the current state of location determination?). having inde-' b'pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.' b'' b'' b"well, i'll avoid your question for now (got some learnin' to do) with a" b'promise to come back with more info when i can find it. i _do_ know that' b'batse is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of' b'long-term sources. given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge' b'of approx. arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well batse can' b'determine the location (rotational) of a gamma ray burster from knowledge' b"of the all-sky map's accuracy. pr material for the other three instruments" b'give accuracies on the order of "fractions of a degree", if that\'s' b'any help.' b'' b'speaking of gro, the net-world probably was happy to see that the preps' b"for orbit adjust appear to be going well. our branch guy who's helping" b'out says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and the' b'burns will take place in mid-june.' b'' b"anyway, i'm off to find out more. 'be back when i get some info." b'' b'"i don\'t know nuthin\' \'bout measurin\' no gamma rays"' b'_gone with the wind_, paraphrased'
