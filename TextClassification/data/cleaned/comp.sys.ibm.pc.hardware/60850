b'' b'' b'hi:' b'' b'i need some advice (opinions?) regarding which pc would best suit my needs!' b'i want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:' b'' b'-\tediting documents using wordperfect (under dos)' b'' b'-\tcreating graphs/analyzing data using sigmaplot v5.0 (under dos)' b'' b'-\tediting/playing with images using aldus photostyler, running under' b'windows these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel' b'' b'-\tusing the pc as an xterminal, running desqview/x and sun pc-nfs,' b"talking to our network of sparcstation's this is where a lot of" b'the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.' b'' b"i've read, read, read pc magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup," b'and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be:' b'' b'486dx-50 256k cache, isa, vlb, 16meg ram' b'ati graphics ultra pro, meg ram, local bus' b'15" monitor, 1280x1024 ni' b'3com etherlink iii 16bit' b'maxtor 240mb ide hard drive' b'' b"however, the parts don't fit! our local retailer apparently put one of these" b"together, only to discover that the ati card wouldn't run at 50mhz surprise" b"surprise. actually, after reading this group, i'm surprised that they even" b'have a 50mhz local bus running...' b'' b'i have a choice now between basically the above system but with a' b'486dx2-66 with isa and vlb, or, a 486dx-50 with eisa and no vlb (and thus' b'the non-local bus version of the ati card). which is better, keeping in mind' b"that i'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?" b'' b'any help would be greatly appreciated! (i need to decide quickly, so any' b'speedy help would be appreciated even more!!)' b'' b'' b'' b'btw: we have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following' b'configuration:' b'' b'486dx-33 64k cache, isa, meg ram' b'ati graphics ultra+, meg ram' b'14" monitor, 1024x768 ni' b'smc ethercard bit' b'maxtor 120mb ide hard drive' b'' b"we're quite happy with the ati card very fast, once the data gets to it!!" b'~slow~ repainting images under photostyler that have moved off screen, or' b'been uncovered!' b'' b"there doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running desqview/x! its sluggish" b'running the local window manager. also, many functions under photostyler take' b'a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).' b'' b"there's not enough memory in the system desqview/x and a meg smartdrive" b"don't leave much room for other apps. photostyler will page to disk with" b'medium size images.' b'' b'i have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates. this' b'machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our sparcs sustain 600k/sec' b'on the same network. going to the bit version of the smc card increases' b'transfer rates to 160k/sec still very slow (especially when moving large' b'images). is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming?? will it' b"make a difference? i'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486dx2-66 choice" b'(above), for that reason.' b'' b"also, are there dx2-100's on the horizon? what about dx3-99's? dx3-150's b'' b'any information is greatly appreciated.' b'' b'-----' b'john p. robarts research institute b'p.o. box perth drive office: b'london, ontario, canada n6a 5k8 home: b'' b''
