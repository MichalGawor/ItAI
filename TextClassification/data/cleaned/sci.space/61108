b'' b'besides the mechanical problems of moving so dense a medium in oan out' b'of the lungs (diaphragm fatigue, etc.), is there likely to be a problem' b'with the mixture? i mean, since the lungs never expel all the air in' b'them, the inhaled air has to mix pretty quickly with the residual air in' b'the lungs to provide a useful partial pressure of oxygen, right? would' b"this mixing be substantially faster/slower at the pressures we're" b'talking about?' b'' b'there was an interesting article in scientific american some time ago' b'about breathing liquid. (it was a few months before _the abyss_ came out.)' b'as far as i can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult' b'to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:' b"- low viscosity if it's too difficult to force the fluid in out" b"of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own" b'breathing effort (let alone anything else)' b'' b'- diffusion rate obviously, not all the air in your lungs is' b"expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled" b"is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)" b'so the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done' b'by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. apparently oxygen' b'tends to diffuse more readily than co2, so even if you can get enough' b'oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough co2 out.' b'' b'- oxygen/co2 capacity you have to be able to dissolve enough' b'gas per unit volume.' b'' b'oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs' b'or interfere with their healing or anything like that...' b'' b'--'
