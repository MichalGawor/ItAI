b'' b'' b'i recently read an article in a local paper written by an islamic' b'person who was upset with the way islam has been portrayed by western media.' b'when a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played' b'up as an islamic terrorist. however, when the a serbian terrorist attacks' b'the croations, its not a christian terrorist, its just a terrorist.' b'i have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe' b'the press, that islam is somehow tied to violence. often times you hear' b'things like "they just don\'t value human life like we do..." and so on.' b'i was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can' b'change this image, or how i can help my friends to see that this is just' b'hype. i would appreciate any serious suggestions or comments via e-mail,' b"and i'm not interested in hearing about how right the press is." b'' b'-scott vann'
