b'' b'|' b'| grf. dropped my shoei rf-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to' b'| rock' b"| it onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it..." b'|' b"| so i cheerfully spent on a bottle of testor's model paint and" b'| repainted the scratches and chips for minutes.' b'|' b"| the question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know" b'| for' b"| certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a b'| church' b"| meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... what are some guidelines? should" b'| i just' b'| pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (xl), or' b'| should i' b'| maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my' b'| likely' b'| passenger?' b'' b'do i have to be the one to say it?' b'' b"don't be so stupid as to leave your helmet on the seat where it can" b'fall down and go boom!' b'' b'that kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against.' b'if you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed' b'on during the drop, the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was' b"intended to do. conservative rec.moto'ers will recommend that you replace" b'the helmet. if you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately, you' b'should.' b'' b'helmets go on the ground, on a table, on a chair, on a shelf, or on' b'any other surface that is large enough to support them so that they' b'will not easily be knocked down.' b'' b"jeezus. my new shoei would be to replace. you think i'm going" b'to leave it to chance?' b'' b'cripe.' b'' b'later,' b'--' b"chris behanna\tdod# h-d fxwg wide glide jubilee's red lady" b'disclaimer: now why would nec\t zx-11 needs a name' b'agree with any of this anyway? i was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs.'
