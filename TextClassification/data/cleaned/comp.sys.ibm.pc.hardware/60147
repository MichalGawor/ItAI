b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i have a question for anyone that may be familiar with isa and eisa sytem' b'configurations.' b'' b'1) after i switch the isa boards into the eisa board (all of the cards are' b'isa) the system seems to work with no problem what so ever. but some of the' b'interupt problems that we had with the isa board continue with the eisa board.' b'is it my understanding that the eisa board should be able to handle irq' b'conficts when running windows.' b'' b'\tproblem: when running our network via telnet (tcp/ip) with windows' b'\trunning the system kicks us out of windows (irq confict within windows' b'\ti assume).' b'' b'also, are there any memory address problems that will happen when the' b'boards are switched (base memory that is).' b'' b' as far as i know, if you are using eisa mother board, you have to use also' b" eisa cards or else your computer system will be slower than when you're" b' using isa board with isa cards.' b' \t\t\t\t\t\t\t-bill' b'' b'' b"that's nonsense!! you can use isa cards in an eisa-system without problem" b'and at the same speed as in an isa system!!' b'' b'-luke'
