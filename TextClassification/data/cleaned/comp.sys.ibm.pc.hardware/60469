b'' b'this past winter i found myself spending a ridiculous amout of time in front' b'of my computer. since my eyes were going berserk, i decided to shell out' b'some serious money to upgrade from a to a monitor. i\'m running' b'800x600 at hz. my eyes are very grateful. however, i find myself using' b'a smaller font with less eye strain. has anyone else had this kind of' b'experience? i thought that small fonts were the culprit but it seems that' b'flicker was my real problem. any comments?' b'' b'alec lee'
