b'' b'i assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths?' b'' b' only my common sense. the fire was caused by either koresh and his' b' followers or by the fbi/atf/cia/kgb/and maybe the harper valley pta. since' b" you are throwing around the evidence arguement, i'll throw it back. can" b' you prove any government agency did it? (please don\'t resort to "they' b' covered it up so that proves they did it" or any wild theories about how' b' the government agencies intentionally started the fire. the key words' b' are proof and evidence.)' b' proves they did it"' b'' b'no, which is why i want an investigation.' b'' b' please explain how koresh was defending himself from those children who' b' burned.' b'' b'who ever said he was? what is obvious is that he was defending himself, and his' b'followers, from the government. whether you think he was right or wrong in' b'this is another question. if he was right, then he had the moral right to kill' b'those kgbatf agents.' b'--ray cote' b'' b"there's no government like no government."
