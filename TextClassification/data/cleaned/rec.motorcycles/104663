b'' b'hola amigos,' b'' b'quiero... i need an answer to a pressing question. i now own two' b'bikes and would love to keep them both. one is a capable and' b'smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great' b'brakes; the other is a beemer g/s, kind of rough for the city but' b'great on the long road and backroad. a good start at a stable, but' b"i don't think it's going to work. unfortunately, insurance is going" b'to pluck me by the short hairs.' b'' b'unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount. they' b"do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of" b"driving one of the things at a time. i don't think i'll ever manage" b'to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (turn left...' b'accelerate the zephyr; turn right... accelerate the beemer.) does' b'anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to' b"discount your rates? state farm doesn't." b'' b"by the way, i'm moving to the bay area so i'll be insuring the bikes" b'there, and registering them. to ease me of the shock, can somebody' b'guesstimate the cost of insuring a zr550 and a r800gs? here in tucson' b'they only cost me (full) and (liability only) for the two,' b'per annum.' b'' b'muchas gracias,' b'enrique'
