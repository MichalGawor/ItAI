b'' b' i heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than' b' gas engines because the emit less of: carbon monoxide,' b' hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen. (co, hc, nox).' b'' b' but they can put out a lot of particulate matter. i heard' b' something about legislation being discussed to "clean up' b' diesel emissions". is there anything in the works to' b' install "scrubbers" for diesels? how about the feasibility' b' of installing them on trucks and cars? would it be any' b" different than a catylitic converter? i'd assume easier," b" since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting" b" gasses. let's hear people's opinions..." b'' b'' b'vw and mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps. also, vw' b'uses a kind of turbocharger on their jetta ecodiesel that helps' b"reduce particulates as well, although i don't know the" b'mechanics of it.' b'' b'many diesel cars,busses, and trucks in europe are now being' b'equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up' b'diesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway.' b'' b"it's a shame gm had to soil the diesel's reputation in" b'passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to' b'research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even' b'further ahead of gas engines in emissions.' b'' b'erik'
