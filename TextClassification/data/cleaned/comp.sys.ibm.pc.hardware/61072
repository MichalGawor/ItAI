b'' b'' b"for the past week or so i've been trying to install a qic-36 tape drive" b'and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 eisa system with no' b'luck. i end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read' b'part of the test. i am pretty certain that the port setting, irq dma are' b'set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind,' b'retension, write and erase, i also booted the system clean and still the' b'same proble so i also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. it has been' b'suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that i need to slow it down.' b"my system has an ami bios and i don't have the advanced chip setting" b'option that i have seen on other systems so i cant do this. am i going to' b"have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work" b'around? i will be glad to hear your advice/suggestions.' b'tony' b'' b''
