b'' b"but after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights, doesn't it start" b'to have a paradoxical effect? i used to take one every night for' b"allergies and couldn't figure out why i developed bad insomnia. finally" b'figured out it was the antihistamines. i would fall asleep for a few' b'minutes but would awaken at the drop of a pin a little later and could not' b"get back to sleep. i don't have that problem since i stopped the" b'antihistamines at bedtime. b'' b'alice' b''
