b'' b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i am interested in trying this "desensitization" method' b'against hay fever.' b'what is the state of affairs about this. i went to a doctor and' b'paid for a minute interview scratches, leading to the' b'diagnostic that i am allergic to (june and timothy) grass.' b'i believe this. from now on it looks like shots per week for' b'6 months followed by shot per month or so. each shot costs' b'$20. talking about soaring costs and the health care system, i would' b'call that a racket. we are not talking about rare amazonian grasses' b"here, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office." b'apart from this issue, i was somewhat disappointed to find out' b'that you have to keep getting the shots forever. is that right?' b'thanks for information.' b'ej' b'' b''
