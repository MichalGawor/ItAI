b'' b' (jon livesey):' b' if there is a western ethic against infanticide, why' b' are so many children dying all over the world?' b'' b' the majority of the world isn\'t "western".' b'' b"superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple. an awful lot of the" b'starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic' b'policies of the western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical' b'westerner. for instance, some third-world countries with terrible' b'malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce so that it can' b'be fed to cattle in the us, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers. they' b'have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans' b'we encouraged them to take out. fund-raising for ethiopia is a truly bizarre' b"idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got." b'' b"perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a western ethic against" b'western infanticide. all the evidence suggests that so long as the children' b"are dying in the third world, we couldn't give a shit. and that goes for the" b'supposed "pro-life" movement, too. they could save far more lives by' b'fighting against third world debt than they will by fighting against' b"abortion. hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more" b'of those by fighting for human rights in china.' b'' b"and besides, suzanne's answer implies that non-western countries lack this" b'ethic against infanticide. apart from china, with its policy of mandatory' b"forced abortion in tibet, i don't believe this to be the case." b'' b'' b'mathew'
