b'' b'im new to xlib programming. im having a problem i hope someone here can' b'help me with. i create a window, and i want it to have some background color,' b'say red, and draw an oval in it. further, when i resize the window, i want' b'to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it' b'is larger or smaller.) im using aixwindows on an rs6000.' b'' b'my problem is this: when i resize the window, only the "original" part of the' b'window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. everything else' b'is a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. i can see that' b'it would be the right size if i could see all of it, but it only shows up in' b'the region that was the original size of the window when created.' b'' b'for example, i start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. if i' b'resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is' b'is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. further the oval' b'only shows up in that 200x200 area.' b'' b'what am i doing wrong?? how can i get a window to resize and redraw a' b're-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?' b'' b'second question:' b'could someone tell me what xaw and xmu are???' b'' b'thanks,' b'chris' b'' b''
