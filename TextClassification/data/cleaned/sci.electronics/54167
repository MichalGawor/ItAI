b'' b'' b'i borrowed a vhs tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying' b'that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the' b'original. i found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different' b"processes. however, i've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so i don't" b"want to take the chance even it's small." b'' b'anyone has experience in this kind of self-destructing video tapes?' b'' b'' b'i have always thought that if i wanted to send the police a tape with' b'a ransom demand on it, or send cnn a video tape to see if they wanted' b'to buy it, i would place a small magnet near the take-up spool so the' b'tape would be erased as it was played. who would think to check?' b'' b'john' b''
