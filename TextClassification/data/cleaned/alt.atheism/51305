b'' b'' b'i think an objective morality does exist, but that most flavors of morality' b'are only approximations to it. once again, a natural or objective morality' b'is fairly easily defined, as long as you have a goal in mind--that is, what' b'is the purpose of this morality.' b"maybe i'm not quite getting what you mean by this, but i think objective" b'morality is an oxymoron. by definition, it seems, any _goal_ oriented' b"issue like this is subjective by nature. i don't get how you're using" b'the word objective.' b'' b'but, the goal need not be a subjective one. for instance, the goal of' b"natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps. it wasn't" b'really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions' b'to this were necessary. intelligent animals have different needs than' b'the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more' b'complicated than "the law of the jungle." i don\'t think that' b'self-actualization is so subjective as you might think. and, by' b'objectivity, i am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be' b'carried out completely.' b'' b'keith'
