b'' b'getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so' b'i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a' b'leadless chip carrier. the flatpack would be hard' b'to test since it has to be soldered on to the test' b'setup and i would spend loads of time soldering' b'as i kept changing the test chip. the leadless chip' b'carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may' b'not work at high speeds.' b'' b'\tdoes anyone out there have experience/knowledge' b'of this field i would greatly appreciate help! any ideas/' b'names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages' b'would help.' b'' b'check with kyocera america, inc.' b'24 prime park way, suite b'natick, ma b'' b'they are one of the largest manufacturers of ic packaging in the' b'world.' b'' b'it sounds like you would be a good candidate for wafer probing or at' b'least ic probing to test performance. hp, cascade microtech and' b'tektronix should be able to help you here. one note, testing at high' b'frequency accurately can be an *expensive* business.' b'' b'--' b'andrew karanicolas' b'mit microsystems technology laboratory'
