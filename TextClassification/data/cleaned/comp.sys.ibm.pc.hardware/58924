b'' b'i heard the rumor as well, but the story differed. intel was not coming' b'out with the tripling clock a clone from ibm was.' b'' b"no rumour, ibm's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last" b"fall (comdex or something, i wasn't there). all you people who are" b'drooling after this chip do realize that it has no fpu, just like' b"486sx, that evil marketing ploy(tm) from intel, don't you? it has 16k" b'of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real' b'estate went. because of some contract, ibm is not allowed to sell its' b'486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become' b'available in any non-ibm machines. of course, nothing prevents other' b"companies from implementing a dx3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out" b'with a real 486dx (fpu and all) clone yet (although amd soon will).' b'--' b'segmented memory helps structure software'
