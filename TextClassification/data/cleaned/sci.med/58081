b'' b'thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question. the' b'final diagnosis was stress. i did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.' b'(rachel receives all her medical care at keller army hospital since she is a' b'military dependant, and the army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments' b'as part of its regular health care.) i am hoping that the arrival of b'spring break, and college acceptance letters, will help. *unfortunately*' b'she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it' b'seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while. b'' b'meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for' b'spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.' b'' b"thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas." b'' b'------------------------' b'philosophy department;wesleyan university;usa'
