b'' b"here are some corrections and additions to hellman's note, courtesy of" b'dorothy denning. again, this is reposted with permission.' b'' b'two requests first, note the roles of s1 and s2. it appears to me' b'and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit' b'key. and the nature of the generation process for k1 and k2 is such' b'that neither can be produced alone. thus, the scheme cannot be' b'implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and' b'another generates the second. *that* is ominous.' b'' b'second these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they' b"carefully-crafted spook postings. don't attempt to draw out hidden" b'meanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of clipper).' b"leave denning out of this; given hellman's record of opposition to des," b'which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, i' b"don't think you can impugn his integrity." b'' b"oh yeah the folks who invented clipper aren't stupid. if you think" b"something doesn't make sense, it's almost certainly because you don't" b'understand their goals.' b'' b'' b'this is an addition (posted with permission) to some tech. details of' b'cliper. they enligthen the use of s1 and s2 for keygeneration.' b'-------------------------------------------' b'date: mon, apr edt' b'' b'i just had another conversation with nsa to clarify some of the features' b'of clipper. please feel free to distribute this and my other messages' b'on clipper.' b'' b'the name of the encryption algorithm is "skipjack."' b'' b'martin hellman had written' b'' b'and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part' b'message which will then be encrypted under the system key sk' b'producing' b'' b'e{ e[m; k], e[k; uk], serial number; sk}' b'' b'to which i responded:' b'' b'my understanding is that e[m; k] is not encrypted under sk (called the' b'"family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to sk is held by' b'law enforcement. does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?' b'' b'i was correct in that e[m; k] is not encrypted under sk. however, skipjack' b'being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key' b'for the family key sk.' b'' b'the unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the' b'serial number n as follows. let n1, n2, and n3 be bit blocks' b'derived from n, and let s1 and s2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.' b'compute the 64-bit block' b'' b'r1 e[d[e[n1; s1]; s2]; s1]' b'' b'(note that this is like using the des in triple encryption mode with' b'two keys.) similarly compute blocks r2 and r3 starting with n2 and n3.' b"(i'm unlear about whether the keys s1 and s2 change. the fact that" b"they're called seeds suggests they might.) then r1, r2, and r3 are" b'concatenated together giving bits. the first bits form k1 and' b'the next bits form k2. the remaining bits are discarded.' b'' b'the seeds s1 and s2 do not change. the whole process is performed on' b'a laptop computer, and s1 and s2 are supplied by two independent people' b'so that no one person knows both. the same s1 and s2 are used during' b'an entire "programming session" to generate keys for a stream of serial' b'numbers. everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be' b'thrown out if desired).' b'' b'the serial number is bits and the values n1, n2, and n3 are formed' b'by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding' b'for each value).' b'' b'the resulting keys k1 and k2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired' b'up with their serial number. each pair is stored in a separate file. the' b'floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two' b'escrow agencies.' b'' b'dorothy denning' b'' b'--------------------------------------------------------' b'i am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.' b'please remark, that in posting this, i do not automatically agree' b"with it's contents and implications. so don't swamp my mailbox b'' b'i just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical' b"discussion that is rising here. and, no, i don't mind if you call" b"s1 and s2 'backdoor', as i could imagine the key-generation process" b'working without these seeds and the dependency of k1,k2 from the' b'serial-number.' b'' b'' b'friendly greetings,' b'' b'germano caronni' b'--' b"instruments register only through things they're designed to register." b'space still contains infinite unknowns.' b'pgp-key-id:341027'
