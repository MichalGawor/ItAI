b'' b" i've just read carol's response and i just had to get into this. i've" b' got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b' what they say.' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b"joe, just 'cause you say they aren't subject to interpretation doesn't" b"necesarily make it so. that's *your* *interpretation* of these texts." b'' b' they are peter timothy and' b' galatians b'' b'2 peter b'but know this first of all, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter' b"of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of" b'human will, but men moved by the holy spirit spoke from god.' b'' b'the study notes in my bible offer three possible meanings for verse b"apparantly it's not as clear to charles ryrie as it is to you." b'' b'2 timothy b'all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching, for' b'reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of' b'god may be adequate, equipped for every good work.' b'' b'galations b'for i would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached' b'by me is not according to man. for i neither received it from man,' b'nor was i taught it, but i receieved it through a revelation of jesus' b'christ.' b'' b'when i read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what' b'every phrase meant. i had stop and think about the possible' b'connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been,' b'wonder if the translator used the correct english word to convey the' b'same meaning: i had to interpret. if you want to believe that your' b"are not interpreting scripture as you read, there's probably nothing" b"i can say to change your mind. but i think it's naive to think that" b'our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.' b'' b' also, based on the fact that jesus is the word incarnate and he judges' b' people if they follow him (see acts and john and that' b" those who reject jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke" b" (see john then jesus' words are true and do not need" b' interpretation, nor would it be just of god to judge based on his word' b' if it had to be interpreted.' b'' b'in college, i took an entire course in biblical interpretation. go to' b'any christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and' b'understanding scripture. if interpretation is unnecessary, there are' b'an awful lot of misguided christians out there wasting a lot of time' b'and energy on it.' b'' b'carol alvin'
