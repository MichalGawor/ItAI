b'' b'' b' this is why the most effective' b"substance-abuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples' spiritual" b'needs.' b'' b'you might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim' b'like this.' b'' b'in 12-step programs (like alcoholics anonymous), one of the steps' b'involves acknowleding a "higher power". aa and other 12-step abuse-' b'recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.' b'' b'[deletia- and so on]' b'' b'i seem to have been rather unclear.' b'' b'what i was asking is this:' b'' b'please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery' b"programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than" b"merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved" b'by the people, a.a, s.r.c. regulars, or snoopy. this will probably' b'involve defining "spritual needs" (is it not that clear) and' b'showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.' b'' b'annother tack you might take is to say that "fulfilling spiritual' b'needs" means "acknowledging a "higher power" of some sort, then' b'show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise' b'identical systems that do not. a correlation here would help you,' b'but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping' b'one crutch for annother. (however, i do feel that religion is' b'usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually' b'poisonous! b'' b'i hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. i actually' b'did know about the step program, its the question of what it does,' b'rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me.' b'---' b'- dan johnson' b'and god said "jeeze, this is dull"... and it *was* dull. genesis b'' b'these opinions probably show what i know.'
