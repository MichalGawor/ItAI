b'' b'our shop uses a package called cadcore very good to scan and' b'subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. the problem is that' b'once the raster file is loaded into the cadcore package, a header is added' b'to the .hrf file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. we' b'would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for' b'further use on our workstations. so, here are my questions:' b'' b'(1) what is the hitachi format? i need this format so i can recognize' b"precisely what to strip out. i strongly suspect that it's a compressed" b'format if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the' b'offending header.' b'' b'(2) are there any unix packages that read and recognize hrf? it would be' b'really nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. b'' b"i've already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which contain" b'graphics formats documentation, with no luck. so, if you know, or knwo' b'someone who knows please email! thanks.' b''
