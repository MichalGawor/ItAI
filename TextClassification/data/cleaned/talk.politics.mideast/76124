then they turned' b"and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the street of the b'baku commissars toward the streetcar line. i went home and told my wife there' b'was a demonstration going on. in fact i thought that we were having the same' b'kind of demonstrations that they had had in yerevan and in karabagh. aside' b'from the things they were shouting, i was surprised that there were only young' b'people in the crowd. and they were minors, under draft age.' b'' b'my wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but i was kind of' b'uneasy and said, "no, let\'s stay at home instead." an hour went by, or maybe' b"an hour and a half. well, i wasn't keeping track of the time, i can't say" b'exactly how long it was. i look and see another crowd on narimanov, but now on' b'the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the rossiya movie theater.' b'' b"i put outside clothes on and went out again. there's noise, an uproar outside," b'and the crowd has grown. there are more people. and whereas the first time' b'there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more' b"aggressive. no, i think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration." b'they would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run' b'again. i was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. i' b"followed them. i was thinking i'd just watch and see. who knew where this was" b'leading? we came out on lenin square. at the square the sk club is on one' b'side, and the city party committee is on the other. i went toward the square' b'and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. there' b'was some sort of a rally going on. i go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.' b'i heard both anti-armenian and anti-soviet appeals. "we don\'t need' b'perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been." now what did they' b'mean by "living like we have been?" the azerbaijanis work like everyone else.' b'but too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense' b'of others. speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. and not just' b"in azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but i've never seen it" b'anywhere else like i have in azerbaijan.' b'' b"now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the armenians'" b"apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. true, i didn't" b'hear them say "kill them" over the microphone, i only heard "beat them and' b'drive them out." i stayed at the square a few minutes longer. first one, then' b'another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. off' b'to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and' b'i think they were mvd [ministry of internal affairs] or state security kgb.' b"there were also uniformed policemen there, but i didn't see any of them try" b'to pacify the crowd. new people kept coming up onto the stage.' b'' b'well i had finally decided that this could end badly: this was no' b'demonstration, and i had to protect my family.' b'' b'i left the square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. it was next' b'to the city party committee, on narimanov street, it stood next to the tai-' b"lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. i see that some-" b'thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. i decided to go look because' b'after all those appeals i was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons' b'in there. they pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the city' b'party committee, but toward the sk club. and when i went right up to them i' b'saw that they were cases of vodka. there were two people handing down the' b'cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, b'to they were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried' b'off by two people. two people, one case of vodka. and there was a man standing' b'right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe' b'about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. it was anasha.' b'when i passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. there was' b'about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. he' b"has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. i" b"have never smoked it myself. once i tried it for fun, but i've seen a lot of" b"people smoke it, i've seen it many times, and i know what it is. i strolled" b'around and no one asked me who i was or what i was doing there.' b'' b'before i got to the glass bazaar i heard more howling, more warlike shouting.' b"i turned around and saw them running. well i'll just keep on going like i am," b'i thought. when they caught up with me i saw that they were carrying flags.' b'and i recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the' b"street. he's a young guy, or years old. he was carrying a red flag," b'which had "ermeni oryum" written on it in azerbaijani, that means "death to' b'armenians!" that guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. i don\'t really' b"know what his name is, but i know his father very well. his father's name is" b'rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. he used to have a dark' b'blue zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white zhiguli his' b'family, as i said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. our building was on' b'narimanov street, and theirs was on the street of the baku commissars;' b'their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the' b"left. now rafik's little brother lives there, and he, rafik, i heard, got a" b'new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. in a word, his son' b'was carrying a flag that said "death to armenians!" i was surprised because' b'before this i had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being' b'done not by people from sumgait, but by azerbaijanis from agdam and kafan.' b'' b'well anyway i went home. my wife was upset. i told her, "it\'s ok, it\'ll pass,' b'they\'re young kids, they\'ve just gotten all whooped up." naturally i didn\'t' b'want her to get overly upset. after a while a new surge of crowd went by. and' b"this time they were breaking glass. i could hear it breaking, but i couldn't" b"see where. well i think, here we go, the machine's in motion. they weren't" b"handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. i didn't see people drinking" b"and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and" b'hashish to put in a store window!' b'' b'so the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one' b"would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, i'll say it again," b"the police were there, i saw them. and it's not just that the police weren't" b'breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.' b"true, at the time i couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-" b"vaunted leadership--and i'm not afraid to say these words: so many people" b'died, so many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--i' b"couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if i were to be" b'specific, i would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of' b"sumgait, i couldn't imagine that such things could take place." b'' b'when they started breaking glass i told my wife and son: "let\'s go upstairs."' b'we went to our neighbors, the grigorians, on the fourth floor. and in the' b'evening, when those crowds started going past again, i went outside once more.' b'i stopped at "the corner," a place called that right next to the bazaar. i' b'look and see a crowd on the run. and there, a few yards from the entrance to' b'the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, years old.' b'the crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed' b'toward the bazaar. and then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,' b'wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. and not a soul went past those three, as' b'though it were off limits! well everything got all churned up, there was more' b'noise, and the glass was flying again.' b'' b"we spent the night at the neighbors'. my apartment was on the first floor," b'there was really no way to defend yourself there.' b'' b'in the morning i went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.' b'on the way i saw someone hunched up, still. i never found out who it was or' b'what happened to him. there were to people standing near him. i got the' b'bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying' b'there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing' b"you couldn't even see him." b'' b'that was on the morning of february everyone knows the rest.' b'' b'may b'yerevan' b'' b'- reference b'' b'[1] _the sumgait tragedy;
