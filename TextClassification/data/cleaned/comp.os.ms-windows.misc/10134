b'' b' [..has ms innovated anything? b'' b' really when you come down to it who cares. i just hope ms keeps doing' b' what they do best getting usable productive software to the masses.' b'' b"lets see... what ms products don't have major bugs in them? oh, but" b'the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up, even if their' b'customers must buy new "releases" from them that are little more than' b'bug fixes. anyone who buys a computer system and then runs ms' b'windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy.' b'' b"oh wait! ms innovated the plastic housing on the ms mouse---didn't" b'they? "logitech inside"' b'' b" personally, i'll be blasphemous and say that if microsoft keeps doing" b' what it does so well, i hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright' b' and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and' b" other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. i'd hate to" b' be one who actually does innovate, and then have microsoft come in' b' like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff,' b" marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. i don't have all" b" that much sympathy for apple's complaint against microsoft, since" b" they just took the ideas from xerox's pa research center when the" b' federal government forced xerox to disclose their patents over' b' antitrust fears. however, for other companies and individuals who' b' have a great idea, yet get it "borrowed" by larger corporations who' b' can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from' b' the original innovator, i feel much sympathy.' b'' b' larry' b' b' larry weeks "those who fight monsters should make sure that' b' when you look long into an abyss the abyss also' b' looks into you." friedrich nietszche' b'' b'' b"you can't even really call it secondary creativity when a company" b'gathers together a bunch of knock-off packages and peddles them to' b'neophytes. if ms does anything, it appears someone has to do it' b'first. it appears that ms is finding out that throwing money at' b'technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution.' b'' b'' b'---------------------------------------------' b'---------------------------------------------'
