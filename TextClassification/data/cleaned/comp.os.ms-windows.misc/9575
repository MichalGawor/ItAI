b'' b'to all hardware and firmware gurus:' b'' b'my current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a' b'physically handicapped relative of mine. my goal is for this keyboard' b'to look exactly like an at sytle keyboard to its host system.' b'this will be a highly endowed keyboard with a little pcl from z world' b'at its heart. the only thing i lack is detailed information on the' b'hardware signaling that the (with windows and dos will be' b'expecting. my project is independant of windows, my hope is that some of' b"you fellow window's users/programmers will recognize what i need and be" b'willing to point me in the right direction.' b'' b'i have the winn l. rosch hardware bible (2nd edition). the hb gives' b'most (if not all) of the information i will need concerning scan codes' b'and even a wire diagram for the ps/2 style connector i will need, but it' b'leaves a number of important questions unanswered.' b"1. is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication? i'm" b'guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock. in either' b'event, how is the data framed?' b"2. is it half-duplex or truly one way? i'm guessing half-duplex" b'since the host can turn leds on and off.' b'3. are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "at' b'keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?' b'' b'if anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of' b'whatever i do it must be safe for i cannot afford to replace the in' b'the event of a booboo.' b'' b'thank you for your time.' b'danke fuer ihre zeit.' b'' b'software engineer' b'sri international'
