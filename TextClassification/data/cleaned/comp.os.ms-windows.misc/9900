b'' b'is anyone out there running a ms-dos system with a localtalk board? i am on an' b'appletalk network, hooked up with a daystar digital lt200 mc localtalk' b"interface board, running on a ps/2 model i'm using the appleshare pc" b'software for file server and network access. it works fine under dos or the' b'window or os/2 dos box. but when i try to load it *before* windows, so that' b'every application i run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as' b'soon as i start up an application. and of course, things look pretty hopeless' b'for os/2 (but who knows).' b'' b'so, does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup?' b'' b'- duncan'
