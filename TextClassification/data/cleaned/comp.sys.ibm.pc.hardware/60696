b'' b'i am looking at buying some companion brand vlb/isa/eisa motherboards with' b'hint chipsets. has anybody had any experience with this board (good or bad)?' b'any information would be helpful!' b'thanks' b'brian j schaufenbuel' b'' b'' b'i believe that any vl/eisa/isa motherboard that uses the hint chipset' b"is limited to 24-bit eisa dma (where 'real' eisa dma is 32-bit). the" b'hint eisa dma has the mb ram addressing limitation of isa. for this' b'reason i would pass. i own one of these (hawk vl/eisa/isa) and am look-' b'ing to replace it for exactly this reason.' b'' b'please double-check me on this. in other words, call the motherboard' b'manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit eisa' b'dma.' b'' b'other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (i am using' b'mine with dos windows and unix s5r3.2). also with adaptec 1742a' b'eisa scsi host adapter.' b'' b'--' b'network management technology incorporated' b'sugar land, texas
