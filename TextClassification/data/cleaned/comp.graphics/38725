b'' b'' b'' b"i'm planning to buy a new vlb/eisa system with a good graphic performance." b'so far i looked at the ati gup vlb as my favorite graphics-card. but' b'recently i heard something about a new card from miro. it was the miro' b'crystal 24s with mb and true color support up to 1024x768. it costs just a' b"little more than the ati. so, can't decide which one matches better my needs." b'any technical references and performance comparisons (especially from the' b'miro card) would be greatly appreciated.' b'' b'-peter-' b'' b'' b'******************************' b'**** universitas basiliensis b'**** switzerland b'********************************' b'' b'' b''
