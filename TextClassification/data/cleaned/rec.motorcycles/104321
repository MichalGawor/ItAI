b'' b'' b" the question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for" b"certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a church" b"meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... what are some guidelines? should i just" b'pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (xl), or should i' b'maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely' b'passenger?' b'' b'if your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a' b'crash, have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size. if your' b'primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws, carry a real big' b'spare (you can put a big or small head in a big helmet, but not in a' b'small one).' b'' b'---' b'ed green, former ninjaite |i was drinking last night with a biker,' b'dod |"go on, get to know her, you\'ll like her!"' b'(the grateful dead) |it seemed like the least i could do...' b''
