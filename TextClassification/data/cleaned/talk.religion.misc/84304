b'' b'' b" recently, i've asked myself a rather interesting question: what right does" b' god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god, of course...!) b'' b" in his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live" b' according to his rules, we will burn in hell. well, with what right can god' b" make that desicion? let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates every" b" one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). what then happens, is" b" that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. well, i didn't ask to be" b' created.' b'' b" let's make an analogue. if a scientist creates a unique living creature (which" b' has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right to' b' expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?' b'' b' who is god to impose its rules on us who can tell if god is really so' b' righteous as god likes us to believe? are all christians a flock of sheep,' b' unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?' b'' b' hmmmmmmmmmmmm.' b'' b' i just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, i mean it.' b'' b' \t\t \thow should one deal with a man who is convinced that' b" \t\t \the is acting according to god's will, and who there-" b' jokke\t\tfore believes that he is doing you a favour by' b' \t\t \tstabbing you in the back?' b'' b' \t\t\t\t\t\t\t-voltaire' b''
