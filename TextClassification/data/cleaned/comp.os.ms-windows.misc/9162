b'' b'' b"i've just bought a pc which came with a bundle of lotus stuff, including" b"adobe type manager version as a newcomer to windows, i'm" b'confused about which i should be using, atm or truetype.' b'' b' b'' b'there is a program called true-effects for windows, that allows you to define' b'attributes for true-type fonts, and have them look like new fonts. it will' b'give your font different backgrounds, or shadows, or reverse, etc...' b'' b'it only works with tt fonts.' b'' b'yes, and the idea was ripped off from adobe, which has had a program' b'called typealign for a few years now. typealign does the same thing' b'for adobe type fonts; *and* adobe has said that the next version' b'will work with both adobe type and truetype.' b'' b'and typealign does some things that trueeffects does not including' b'some things you apparently want b'' b'if you want to use it, you best not want to use it with an atm type font.' b'' b'(oh, yeah... lest you think this is a really cool program, none of the' b'effects are scalable (like the brick background pattern is the same size' b'whether your font is point of point.), and it is not extensible,' b'i.e. you can not add pattern of your own.' b"and you can't rorate the background pattern..." b"and you can't make the pattern extend beyond one character" b'\t(every character in that new font has the entire pattern in it,' b'\tas opposed to having the same pattern run contiguously through' b'\ta couple of characters)' b'' b'it is however cheap.' b'maybe i will buy a copy when the next version comes out, if they fix some of' b'these gripes...' b'' b'\t\t\tjohn.'
