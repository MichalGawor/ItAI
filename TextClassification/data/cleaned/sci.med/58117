b'' b'i was wondering what steps are being taken to prevent the spread of' b"multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. i've heard that some places are" b"thinking of incarcerating those with the disease. doesn't this violate" b'the civil rights of these individuals? are there any legal precedents' b'for such action?' b'' b'' b'who knows in this legal climate, but there is tremendous legal precendent' b'for forcibly quarantining tb patients in sanitariums. yrs ago' b'it was done all the time. it has been done sporadically all along' b"in patients who won't take their medicine. if you have tb you" b'may find yourself under surveilence of the public health department' b'and you may find they have the legal power to insist you make your' b'clinic visits.' b'--' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'gordon banks n3jxp "skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
