b'' b'benedikt rosenau writes, with great authority:' b'' b' if it is contradictory it cannot exist.' b'' b'"contradictory" is a property of language. if i correct this to' b'' b' things defined by contradictory language do not exist' b'' b'i will object to definitions as reality. if you then amend it to' b'' b' things described by contradictory language do not exist' b'' b"then we've come to something which is plainly false. failures in" b'description are merely failures in description.' b'' b'how about this description: "an object that is, at one time, both a' b'euclidean square and a euclidean circle"? i hold that no object satisfying' b'this description could exist. the description is inconsistent, and hence' b'describes an object that could not exist.' b'now, suppose someone pointed to a bicycle, and said, "that object is,' b'at one time, both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle." this does' b'not mean that the bicycle does not exist, it measn that the description' b'was incorrectly applied.' b'' b'the atheist says, "the descriptions of god that i have been presented with' b'are contradictory, and hence describe something that cannot exist."' b'now, your position (so far as i can gather) is that god exists, but the' b'descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions' b'of it.' b'this is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and,' b'when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one,' b'are told that it is a "euclidean circle-square". can they be blamed for' b"doubting rather strongly that this 'bicycle' exists at all?" b'' b"(i'm not an objectivist, remember.)" b'' b'no kidding. b'' b'sincerely,' b'' b'' b'"the meek can *have* the earth. the rest of us are going to the' b'stars!" robert a. heinlein'
