b'' b'i have a friend with an original hp laserjet. the nameplate does not' b'specify a number, but since the lj ii followed later, one assumes that he' b'has a lj i. his problem is a tax program which requires a cpi font to' b'print the forms properly.' b'' b'this unit came to market in versions. the plus version supported' b'dowloadable fonts. you can guess which one my friend has the plain, not' b'the plus. the printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction' b'of cartridges including a cpi but none with a cpi font.' b'' b'can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a (or cpi font?' b'alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable' b'cost?' b'' b'any suggestions would be welcome.' b'' b'thanks' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'---' b'* winqwk 2.0b#943 seattle rain festival jan. to dec. b'--' b'canada remote systems toronto, ontario' b'416-629-7000/629-7044'
