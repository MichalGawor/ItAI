b'' b'as for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms' b'of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)' b'is in my opinion to the scaling of mt. everest without oxygen assistance...' b'... this is quite a feat of physiological endurance...' b'' b"indeed so; it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible. it is" b'possible only because mount everest is at a fairly low latitude: there' b'is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere beyond what is induced' b"by the earth's rotation thanks to the overall circulation pattern of" b'the atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equator' b'where it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make everest-' b'without-oxygen feasible. only just feasible, mind you: the guys who did' b'it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation,' b'and probably incurred some permanent brain damage.' b'--'
