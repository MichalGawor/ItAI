b'' b'' b'kent, with regards to the information contained in the bible (which' b'is the original context of this thread), brian kendig is inside a huge' b'wall. brian *is* inside. the bible and the information contained therein' b'are outside the wall.' b'' b"um, i think you and the bible are the ones inside the wall. there's a" b'really wonderful world out here. you really should peek out at it sometime.' b'' b'the silly things you keep saying only reinforce the fact that we *are*' b'on opposite sides of a very high wall. i see how incredibly beautiful' b'things are on my side, and i only keep telling you about it because' b"i'd like to you come join me here." b'' b'brian kendig proves this very sad fact by the' b'absurd things he says. for example, "if i get through into the firey' b'pit, i will cease to exist."' b'' b'i never said that. i said that i would prefer to cease to exist than' b"to be tossed into any god's version of hell." b'' b'i am proposing to brian, "brian, come up here' b'and take a look from this vantage point." but brian replies, "i rather' b'not thank you. i am content where i am. besides, the vista from up' b'there stinks." and in the meanwhile, brian ignores the facts that' b'he has never up there nor does he realize i had shared the same' b'plateau where brian now stands.' b'' b'you say to me, "brian, come up here and take a look from this vantage' b'point." but you\'re in a valley, looking at a crayon drawing of a sun' b"and a tree, and i can't for the life of me figure out why you're so" b"immersed in it. *i*'m the one trying to get you to come up here," b"don't you see?" b'' b'--' b'_/_/_/ brian kendig je ne suis fait comme aucun' b"_/_/ n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent." b'/ the meaning of life si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre.' b'/ is that it ends. rousseau'
