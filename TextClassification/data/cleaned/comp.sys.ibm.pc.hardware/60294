b'' b'' b'in pc magazine april "although scsi is twice as fasst as esdi,' b'20% faster than ide, and support up to devices its acceptance ...has' b'long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches."' b'' b'i love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re:' b"performance. where do they get those numbers? i'll list the actual" b'performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a' b'statement is absurd:' b'scsi-i ranges from 0-5mb/s.' b'scsi-ii ranges from 0-40mb/s.' b'ide ranges from 0-8.3mb/s.' b'esdi is always 1.25mb/s (although there are some non-standard versions)' b'' b'by your own data the "although scsi is twice as fast as esdi" is correct' b'' b'(how is twice do you just pick whatever scsi setup that makes' b'the statment "correct"?)' b'even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless' b'you understood that esdi and ide (i include scsi and ata) are' b'completely different (esdi is device-level, like mfm/rll).' b'' b'' b'with a scsi-2 controller chip scsi-1 can reach 10mb/s which is indeed' b'"20% faster than ide" of is all these scsi facts have been' b'' b'great, you can compare two numbers (ata has several speed modes, by the' b'way) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.' b'' b'posted to this newsgroup in my mac ibm info sheet {available by ftp on' b'sumex-aim.stanford.edu in the info-mac/report as' b'mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (it should be but may still be there)}' b'' b'i would recommend people call the ncr board and download the ansi specs' b'if they are really interested in this stuff.' b'' b'' b'part of this problem is both mac and ibm pc are inconsiant about what scsi' b'is which. though it is well documented that the quadra has a scsi-2 chip' b'an apple salesperson said "it uses a fast scsi-1 chip" {not at a 6mb/s,' b'10mb/s burst it does not. scsi-1 is 5mb/s maximum synchronous and quadra' b'uses ansynchronous scsi which is slower} it seems that mac and ibm see' b'' b"something is missing there. anyway, i agree. there's a lot of" b'opportunity for marketing jingo like "scsi-2 compliant" which tells' b'you nothing about the performance, whether it has "wide" support, etc.' b'' b"one reference for the quadra's scsi-2 controller chip is" b'(digital review, oct v8 n33 p8(1)).' b'' b'what does it use? hopefully a good ncr chip (e.g. 53c710)' b''
