b'' b'' b'| question b'| b'| \tif i am right about the doppler(if i spell it different every time,' b'| maybe one will be right) effect, how does the radar get an accurate reading' b'| when the car containing it is moving?? it would seem to me for all thats' b'| worth) that it would need to be calibrated with the speedometer of the car' b"| containing it?? i am fairly sure this isn't the case, so whats the deal??" b'|' b'| essentially, this is actually how it is done. the radar gun is tied into' b'| the speedometer of the car.' b'' b'no, it is independent of the speedometer. the gun processes two doppler' b'returns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed' b'of the target, taking the difference between the two. some guns with' b'a "moving mode" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed' b'preferentially at the pavement.' b'' b'car and driver had a good article on traffic radar, but it was back in' b'1985. i used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus' b'radar-measured ticket. it detailed "moving mode," which is easier to' b'defend against because of the increased amount of variables.' b'' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------' b'dave medin\t\t\tphone:\t(205) (w)' b'ssd--networking\t\t\t\t(205) (h)' b'intergraph corp.' b'huntsville, al 35894\t\tuucp: ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin' b'' b'******* everywhere you look (at least around my office) b'' b'* the opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)'
