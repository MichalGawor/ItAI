b'' b'\tfor the same money, you can get a kryptonite cable lock, which is' b'anywhere from to thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded' b"in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type" b"locking mechanism. i don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's" b'more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat' b'in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear model).' b'' b"\tfyi, i'll be getting a krypto cable next paycheck." b'' b'a word of warning, though: kryptonite also sells almost useless cable' b'locks under the kryptonite name.' b'' b'when i obtained my second motorcycle, i migrated one of my kryptonite' b'u-locks from my bicycle to the new bike. i then went out shopping for' b'a new lock for the bicycle.' b'' b'for about the same money i had the choice of a kryptonite cable lock' b'(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,' b'kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name u-lock (advantages: real steel).' b'i chose the kryptonite cable. after less than a week, i took it back in' b'disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name u-lock.' b'' b'first, the krypto cable i bought is not made by kryptonite, is not covered by' b"the kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach kryptonite standards of" b'quality and quality assurance. it is just some generic made-in-taiwan cable' b'lock with the kryptonite name on it.' b'' b'secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke. i' b"don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often" b'quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes' b'it would seem to engage, only to fall open when i went to unlock it.' b'' b'thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves' b'the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the' b"dark. i didn't try it (obviously), but i have my doubts that the" b'lock mechanism would stand up to an "insert screwdriver and torque"' b'attack.' b'' b'fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to' b'deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is). all cables suffer the' b'weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time. if you are patient' b'you can cut cables with fingernail clippers. aviation snips would go' b'through the cable in well under a minute.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'michael robinson uucp: ucbvax!cogsci!robinson'
