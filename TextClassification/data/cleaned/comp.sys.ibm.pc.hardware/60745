b'' b'have anybody succeded in converting a atari monomchrome monitor into a' b'mono vga monitor. if so please let me know exactly how you did and what' b'graphics card you used.' b'i wish i could help! i posted a similar question about two weeks ago;' b"i got no response at all. i've asked locally at my friendly atari store." b'i was told that it should be possible, but that they had no idea how' b'it might be done. nor did they particularly care to investigate.' b'' b'please, if anyone has _any_ suggestions, post them!' b'' b'' b'you might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one' b'may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware). i say this because the conversion' b'seems more geared toward a pc user wanting to use that monitor, than' b'an atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they' b'want to really go wild converting the monitor to vga, then' b'using it as a vga monitor with a falcon b'' b'as for graphics cards, assuming that the atari monitor can be' b'modified/adapted to handle vga signals, you should probably be able' b"to use any vga card (at least with a res around 640x400). i haven't" b'tried this, but that would be my guess...' b'' b'robert anisko' b'' b'' b'...you might want to price mono vga monitors anyways it may be cheaper' b'to go that route than to do the conversion; besides, with the falcon and' b'beyond, vga/svga/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go...' b'' b'' b''
