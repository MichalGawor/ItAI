b'' b' has anyone used a hercules graphite adapter? it looks good on paper, and' b" steve gibson gave it a very good review in infoworld. i'd love to get a" b' real-world impression, though how is the speed? drivers? support?' b'' b' but the impressive performance of the graphite was' b' not its winmark, it was its wintach result (esp. the paint' b' performance). judging from the wintach tests, i can hardly' b' imagine that there is a cheat driver for it.' b'' b"i received my graphite vl on thursday, and i've had a little bit of" b'experience with it now. in general, it feels *fast*, although this' b'is the first vlb card that i have tried. still, the results are' b'impressive.' b'' b"with my 486dx2/66 w/16 mb, running at 1024x768/256, i've had the following" b'wintach results:' b'' b'' b'card\t\t\t\twp\tcad\tspread\tpaint\toverall' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'ati graphics ultra\t\t13.5\t14.5\t19.1\t25.0\t18.0' b'ati ultra+ (no aperture)\t11.2\t13.8\t10.7\t20.9\t14.1' b'hercules graphite vl\t\t16.1\t67.8\t41.4\t52.8\t44.5' b'' b"unfortunately i don't have the numbers here, but the ati ultra pro vlb" b'had an overall wintach score of about the ultra pro was nearly as' b'fast in text handling, but was blown away in the cad and paint tests.' b'' b'as an additional test, we hand-timed a complex coreldraw! slide resize/-' b"redraw times. there was no swapping, but i'd expect there is a fairly" b'heavy load on the cpu. the graphite redraw times averaged about b"seconds, with ati ultra pro at this jives with steve gibson's" b'contention that the isa graphite is faster than an ati up on his complex' b'micrografx draw document.' b'' b"so far, i'm *very* impressed. the drivers look solid, and the card flies." b"the installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ati's. and" b"i didn't have to wait for build for some reliability... with hercules'" b'software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for' b'just (or for the isa version). call if you want to' b"give it a try i'm a happy customer now!" b'' b'--' b'[ "stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth. now pull b'[ up. that\'s how the corrado makes you feel." car, january
