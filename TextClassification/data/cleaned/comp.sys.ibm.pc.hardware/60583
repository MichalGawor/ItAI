b'' b'hello,' b'i have a hayes moden with no cables or manuals. the' b'modem requires a source of 14v ac, but i do not know how' b'to connect the power source to the pin connector. i know' b'that the top pin is the ground, so i would guess that the other' b'two are the ac pins, right? if you have any hints, please' b'e-mail me, i really need help... thanks!!! duc n.'
