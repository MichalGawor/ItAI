b'' b'' b'well thank you dennis for your as usual highly detailed and informative' b'posting.' b'' b'the question i have about the proton, is could it be handled at' b"one of ksc's spare pads, without major malfunction, or could it be" b'handled at kourou or vandenberg?' b'' b'now if it uses storables, then how long would it take for the russians' b'to equip something at cape york?' b'' b'if proton were launched from a western site, how would it compare to the' b't4/centaur? as i see it, it should lift very close to the t4.' b'' b'pat'
