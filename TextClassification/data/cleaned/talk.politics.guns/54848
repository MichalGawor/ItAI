b'' b'nothing could at this point. what would have gone a long way toward' b'convincing me would have been media video, particularly from diverse' b"sources. imho, if the government didn't have anything to hide, they" b'would have allowed cameras near the compound from the beginning.' b'' b'i agree, i saw no reason they could not have had "close in" pool' b'cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever.' b'' b"[points made by dick degueran, koresh's lawyer]" b'*\tthe tanks were not pumping cs gas but were ejecting exploding' b'\tcanisters from the tank booms that penetrated multiple walls' b'\tbefore exploding.' b'' b"okay, their word against the fbi's at this point. see ya in court!" b'' b'*\tthe tanks were collapsing interior walls and ceilings putting people' b'\tat great risk.' b'' b'dear, dear. they could have come out.' b'' b'*\tthe construction of the coupound used almost all used materials that' b'\twere very dry and bails of hay were stacked against the walls as' b"\tshields against the government's bullets." b'' b'okay, they were living in a fire hazard. that they built.' b'' b'*\tsaid that previous to the invasion there were no military drills' b'\tand that the supplies they had on hand were for survival.' b'' b'no crime, irrelevant either way.' b'' b'*\ttheir gas masks worked so well that many members were having bible' b'\tstudy and some were sleeping when the fire was set.' b'' b'ah yes, that is exactly what i would do. hold bible study. take a nap.' b"always a wise course of action when you're being gassed." b'' b'*\tthere was no group instruction of any kind from koresh or his' b'\taids after the tank invasion (referring to any kind of suicide' b'\tpact or counter-assault efforts.)' b'' b'i don\'t believe there was a "suicide pact". i believe that koresh' b'wanted a fiery conflagration which he may not have told his followers.' b"in fact, this hypothesis is confirmed by the survivors' stories." b'' b'*\teveryone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape' b'\tthe falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was set.' b'' b"yes, that's right. and once the whole compound was demolished, where" b'did they expect to go?' b'' b'*\twomen and children who has sought shelter on the second floor from' b'\tthe tanks were trapped by doors jammed by the tanks ramming the' b'\tbuilding and distorting the frames.' b'' b"the building is being rammed and they are going upstairs? that's almost" b'as bad as running into a fire.' b'' b'*\thallways ran the length of the buildings that acted as conduits for' b'\tthe fire and trapped almost everyone in place. his experts have told' b'\thim that this horizonal chimney effect is what made the fire appear' b'\tto have started at several places at once.' b'' b"hm, an interesting notion. we'll see." b'' b'*\tkoresh was not seen the last hour before the fire and was assumed to' b'\tbe in his 4th floor room with some of his children.' b'' b"more bible study, no doubt. hey, it's a *priority*." b'' b'*\tthe texas medical examiner has stated flatly that none of the bodies' b"\trecovered so far had bullet wounds, directly contradicting the fbi's" b'\tlies.' b'' b'actually, on friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and' b"he could not flatly contradict the federal agents' claims. we'll know" b"more later. in any event, it's irrelevant." b'' b'*\tthe survivors unanimously stated that if the victims could have gotten' b'\tout they would have, that they were trapped by the tank-destroyed' b'\tbuilding and the speed of the fire.' b'' b'for six hours they were trapped? the building was not "destroyed"' b'immediately. they could have left at any time.' b'' b'*\tthe underground bunker cited by the fbi as the place koresh could have' b'\tput the children had he not been a cold blooded killer had been blocked' b'\tby the tanks crashing down debris on top of the access door.' b'' b'six hours to move it away. or come out.' b'' b"*\tdick said that he had sat in koresh's bedroom talking to him and" b'\thad observed that his room was furnished like all the rest and without' b"\tair condition or other luxuries, directly contradicting the fbi's claim" b'\tthat he lived in splendor.' b'' b'irrelevant, anyway. pr one way or the other, but no crime or innocence' b'indicated.' b'' b"*\tdick saw bullet holes in koresh's room made from the outside-in" b'\twhich indicates the batf was indiscriminately shooting down through' b'\tthe roof.' b'' b'no word on whether they were being fired back at, which is an operative' b'question here.' b'' b'* the fire was probably started by the tanks knocking over coleman lanterns' b'\tthat were lit and sitting on a piano next to the wall the tanks busted' b'\tthrough, though none of the survivors saw the fire start.' b'' b'right. for six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at' b'any point, and you leave a coleman lantern burning. near bales of hay.' b'' b'*\tevery one of the survivors strongly denies ever saying anything to the' b'\tfbi about starting the fire, hearing someone say the fire was lit' b'\tor any of the other stuff attributed to them by the fbi.' b'' b'it\'s ultimately irrelevant who "lit" the fire. they had ample opportunity' b'to leave.' b'' b'*\the said when he first met koresh in the compound he expected to find' b'\ta raving lunatic but instead found a rational, charming and intelligent' b'\tyoung man and was very surprised by that fact.' b'' b'most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually. they tend' b'to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators. (ex.: ted bundy.)' b'' b'*\tkoresh had no drugs stronger than aspirin to use against pain.' b'' b'medical assistance was jsut a phone call away. gee, all he had to do' b'was come out.' b'' b'*\twomen with children had their own bedrooms for them and their kids' b"\tthat were appointed as nicely as koresh's." b'' b'not relevant to any crimes.' b'' b'*\tdick said he saw signs of home schooling for the kids and at no time' b'\tdid he ever see any signs of abuse.' b'' b"while he was there. anyway, outsiders rarely see abuse. it's a secretive" b'thing. all we have to go on are the court documents in the jewell case' b'and the mistrial in california.' b'' b'*\tno one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any' b'\ttime. the people who were murdered in the fire were there by their' b'\town choices.' b'' b'exactly. by their own choice.' b'' b'*\the called for an independent prosecutor. if ever there were a need' b'\tfor one, this is it.' b'' b'looks like there will be several investigations, starting with congressional' b'committee hearings next week....' b'' b'his closing comments were "they don\'t look upon themselves as a cult.' b'they view themselves as highly religious people. they sincerely believe' b'what they believe. and who am you or i to judge that as wrong?"' b'' b'his last sentence says it all. who the hell are we (or the government)' b'to judge their religion as wrong. this event, i hope, will be recorded' b'in history as the american holocaust. these people were murdered' b'by the us government just as surely as the jews were by the nazis.' b"i hang my head in shame for what i've allowed my government to become." b'' b'i have never judged them by their religion, but by their actions.' b'' b'if they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would' b'have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths. instead, they chose courses' b'of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid, if not' b'irrational. the first was to stockpile weapons. the second was to' b'shoot federal agents. the third was to stay inside.' b'' b"just as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy" b"weapon at him, i don't think the fbi deserves blame in this case." b'' b'--' b'| the koresh cult standoff is over may his victims recquiescat in pace b'| b'| (the above is a net.moment of silence)
