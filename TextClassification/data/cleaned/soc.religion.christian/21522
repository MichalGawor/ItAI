b'' b'' b"often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) i've" b'heard the passage from revelation:' b'' b'"...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes' b'words from this book..."' b'' b'used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.' b'' b'i feel this is ridiculous for two reasons:' b'' b"1. they weren't added later by the catholic church; they were" b'*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture.' b'(this has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason' b'to repeat the info.)' b'' b'2. it is more likely than not that when st. john (or whomever) wrote' b'the book of revelation what was then considered scripture was' b'** not the same thing you and i are holding in our hands!' b'' b'if one takes the translation of "this book" in rev (or somewhere' b'around there) to mean "all of scripture", then all of us are likely' b'holding something that is in violation of this command.' b'' b'it is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the n.t. ones' b"(they didn't like to date their letters, i guess). i really wish i" b'had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but i believe' b'that several of the n.t. letters, chief among them peter, have their' b'most likely date of composition in the early second century a.d.' b'revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of' b'domition (sp?), a.d. thus it could be argues that we are all' b'in sin if we accept peter as scripture, since it was "added" to the' b'book after the composition of revelation, when we are told to add' b'nothing more.' b'' b'if you want to get the exact dates, get a copy of the new american' b"bible. i'll try to follow this up tomorrow if i remember." b'- mike walker' b'(univ. of illinois)'
