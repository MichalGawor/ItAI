b'' b"is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbi's?" b'this is the situation that brought the question up:' b'' b'the red sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of the mariners' b'had the bases loaded with out. the batter hits a fly to center, which the' b'fielder catches. the runner at third tags and scores without a throw.' b'' b"now, without a judgement call (and i don't think there is one), this is an rbi" b'for the batter. it seems to me that a better name for this would be "defensive' b'indifference", since it doesn\'t really matter whether the guy at third scores' b'at that point. (i know, i can think of several "if the mariners stole third' b'and second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a' b'grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and' b"third, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and" b"maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc..." b'scenarios, too. but does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when' b"you're down by if the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)" b'' b'the point is that the batter (imo) shouldn\'t get "credit" (an rbi) for utterly' b'failing to do his job which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not' b'trade an out for one run. what do you guys think?' b'' b'regards,' b'burke (charles s. homan)' b'go red sox!!! b'go rocket!
