b'' b'' b'' b'how does print manager deal with multiple printers?' b'' b" we're planning... b'' b'...to print to two "printers" from an application. one will be a' b'real printer, and the other a...' b'' b' fax program. b'' b'... will print manager' b'just deal with the jobs one at a time, or will it feed to both' b'printers at once?' b'' b'' b'please research carefully. just because a fax modem behaves like' b'a printer on a "local" machine, doesn\'t guarantee functionality' b'when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely' b'installed" fax card. i tried this with workgroups and the' b"fax software didn't like it at all. could have been winfax's" b"peculiarisms but i don't think so. a lot of special hardware" b'interaction takes place internally. in my case, a fax manager' b'program merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to' b"it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory. to" b'software, it appears the job was "printed". print manager' b'plays no part in the handling of the actual process.' b'' b"pardon me if i've incorrectly assumed this is what you were" b'up to. a truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be' b'required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.' b'' b'good luck.'
