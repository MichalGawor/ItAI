b'' b'' b' though i agree this is not the place to discuss guns, i note in passing that' b' a number of gun apologists seem to have ignored the words "well regulated"' b' in their distorted interpretations of the second amendment.' b'' b'though david sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that' b'talk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the' b'second amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out' b'of relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active' b'threads discussing exactly this topic which at least explore the fallacies' b'of his erroneous claim, and at most explode them.' b'' b'basic fact mr. sternlight: the right described is a "right of the people' b'to keep and bear arms;" not a "right of the people to form a militia," a' b'"right of a militia to keep and bear arms," or a "right of well-regulated' b'people to keep and bear arms." this should be apparent from a simple' b'reading of the sentence.' b'' b'for the other arguments, i suggest you check out the thread, "some more' b'about gun control," playing now in an alt.politics.usa.constitution' b'near you.' b'--' b'' b''
