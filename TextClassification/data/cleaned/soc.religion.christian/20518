b'' b'' b' in quebec french, the word for the celebration of the resurrection is' b' "pa^ques"--this is etymologically related to pesach (passover) and the' b' pascal lamb. so is the french canadian (mostly roman catholic) celebration' b' better because it uses the right name?' b'' b"i was at my parents' seder and noticed the labelling on one of the" b'packages was english, hebrew and french. in the phrase "kosher for' b'passover" the french word used was "pa^ques." we\'ve deliberately' b'mistranslated this at the kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods' b'being kosher for easter. b'' b'back to the original questions in this thread concerning christians of' b'jewish descent and the law: i always wonder when i see posts on this' b'subject whether the writers are christians of jewish descent relating' b'the life-decisions god has led them to or people who take only an' b'academic interest in the topic. (having known seanna since she was nine' b'years old, i do know in this case.) i admit that the answer to this' b"question affects the amount of weight i give to the writer's statement." b''
