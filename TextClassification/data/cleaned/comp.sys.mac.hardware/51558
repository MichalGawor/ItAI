b'' b'writes:' b" i'm going to buy a daystar with mhz for the se/30. since there" b' were so many mails about problems with this board, my questions:' b' does the board work with and a/ux does anybody know problems' b' with any kind of software b'' b" well, i haven't seen any reports of problems with the turbo b' but to my knowledge, daystar has not released a version of the' b' board that works with anything but the iisi and iici, and they' b' have not finished tweaking/testing for use with a/ux. this may' b' not happen until the a/ux upgrade is released (my guess) so' b" i'd recommend waiting or buying the mhz board and upgrade" b" later when a/ux compatibility is assured. turbo interface" b' cards for the ii, iix, se/30, iicx, etc will probably be available' b' sooner, but if a/ux compatibility is a requirement, it is probably' b' best to be patient and let someone else be the pioneer. b'' b'an added advantate of waiting for the daystar for the se/30 is that,' b"just as with the power cache, the accelerator will plug into" b'the cpu socket, leaving the pds slot free for a video card or ethernet' b"card. with daystar's upgrade path, it's a no lose situation." b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'earl d. fife department of mathematics' b'(616)957-6403 grand rapids, mi b'' b'========================================================================='
