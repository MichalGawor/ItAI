b'' b'if you put a locking lugnut on your tires, do you need to have your' b'tires rebalanced??' b'' b'john mas' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'well, it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have. my previous' b'car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others.' b'the locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory' b'service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was' b'supposed to put a oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking' b'nut. i always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no' b'one ever did the service correctly. i eventually got rid of the locking' b'lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts. unfortunately, i' b'found out about the counterweighting technique months after i got rid' b'of the locking nuts. b'' b'my present car, a saturn sc, has locking lugnuts that i bought at the' b'dealer and are made specifically for the saturn. they have been made to' b'be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the' b"package and i verified it myself). i haven't had any vibration problems" b'with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in of ownership. i did' b'have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire' b'balancing.' b'' b'tom'
