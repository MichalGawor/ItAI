b'' b'this is the part that usually gets me. while i am set to make money, there usually' b'are other things to be considered and debated. that is the purpose of life.' b'' b'like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product are measures' b'of success. they can be measures of short term or long term success. i think' b'in ms case they are a good measure of their long term success. the original' b'post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number' b'of people attacking ms and not willing to accept anything positive about ms.' b'i was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to' b'look at the sales of ms products they definitely tell a different story.' b'' b'i also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call' b"them are highly technical. look around in the real world people don't want" b'to grep and auck and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their' b'job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need' b'a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. like it or not ms and the' b'multitudes of business applications that exist to run under windows does' b"this and does it well. we are running pc's loaded with a complete" b'suite of mostly ms windows applications in an administrative business' b'function on a novell network running all software off the server.' b'it does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick' b'windows again.' b'again i repeat to ms keep doing what you are doing. you are doing a great' b'job.' b'flame on' b'thx dave l'
