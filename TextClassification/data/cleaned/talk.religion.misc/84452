b'' b'capser, before you deceive everone into thinking that the latter-day' b'saints have undergone undue persecution through the years for just' b'believing in their religion, perhaps you would like to tell us all what' b'happened in the mountain meadow massacres and all the killings that were' b'done under the blood atonement doctrine, at the command of brigham young?' b'' b'i recently watched a an episode of "the old west" a tv show on the' b'discovery channel (or perhaps the a&e network), the one hosted by kenny' b'rogers. this episode was all about the mormons and how they settled utah,' b'etc.' b'' b'a large portion of the broadcast was about the "mountain meadows massacre".' b'the program very specifically pointed out that brigham young knew nothing' b'about the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph), and' b'it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid moromn' b'settlers into what amounted to a mob. all participants in the incident were' b'prosecuted and eccomunicated from the lds church.' b'' b'i suggest you watch a rerun of that episode (they play them over and over)' b'and see what they (non-mormons) have to say about it.' b'' b'' b'lance' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'+------------------------------------------------------------------------+' b'| "ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." b'+------------------------------------------------------------------------+'
