b'' b"i've been following the giants closely over the off-season newspapers," b'notesgroup, etc but i had my first up close and personal last night at' b'the stick.' b'' b"after watching giants hitters struggle last year, barry's swing was" b"very impressive he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even" b'compared to clark (particularly clark as of late).' b'' b"it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well. i'm not sure if" b'barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked' b"three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for rbi's." b'' b'the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in' b'addition to bonds. there has been some good pitching and some hitters' b"seem to be swinging much better. clayton's defense has been superb." b'mcgee seems to like leading off this year. manwaring is driving the ball.' b'so on so forth.' b'' b'i hope it continues...i think they need to continue well into june before' b'people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.' b'' b'for myself, i think the fresh start of magowan/baker/etc has really wiped' b'out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor' b'in helping them significantly improve over last year.' b'' b'joe loos'
