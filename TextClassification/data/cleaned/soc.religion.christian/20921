b'' b'hi there netters,' b'i have a question i would very much like to see some discussion on:' b"is there such a thing as a 'justifible' war?" b'' b'what i would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: "all war' b'is wrong", or "some war is justifiable".' b'' b'to get things started i would like to outline why i am asking the' b'question. in my high school days i had been quite involved in the the new' b'zealand cadet forces (this is a bit like rotc from what i understand of' b'it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).' b'through this i became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved' b'in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation' b"hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. my favourite" b'computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both' b'past and present.' b'' b'i became a christian about years ago, and at the time rejected all' b'military activity as immoral. for me, all war was in complete opposition' b"to god's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies." b'' b'during the war in iraq, i found myself with great excitement listening to' b'the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation' b"technology i so admire the f117a 'stealh' bomber, the f14, f15 and f16" b'strike aircraft, etc. after the war concluded i began to really enjoy' b"simulations based around this conflict great to go and bomb saddam's" b'bio-weapons plants in an f117a on my computer, or shoot down some of his' b"mig's in an f16. the simulation of the death of people was a wonderful" b'game. i imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.' b'one only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact' b'of war is ignored: a building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a' b"pilot is simply a 'target'. dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. these" b'euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose' b'support are necessary for the continued waging of war one only has to' b'look at vietnam to see how important public opinion is.' b'' b'now we see troops sponsored by the united nations entering somalia, and' b'the prospect of military intervention in the muslim/croat/serb conflict in' b'the former yugoslavia. my revulsion in particular to the siege of' b"sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) sebrenitsa," b"has caused me to rethink where i stand on 'justifiable' war." b'' b'i will list several wars in the last years i can look at each, and say' b'- yes this may have been justifible, this may not. these are simply my gut' b'reactions to each in many cases with the benefit of the impartiality' b'history brings. let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for' b'my reaction i am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, i' b'am working from popular history as it is known in new zealand.' b'' b'1. the second world war' b'- murder of jews hitler had to be stopped.' b'- massive civilian casualties on both sides' b'- dresden, hiroshima/nagasaki' b'- probably justifiable.' b'' b'2. korean war' b'- political expansionism by north korea, basically' b'communism vs. capitalism.' b'- probably not justifiable.' b'' b'3. vietnam' b'- as above, worsened by us involvement.' b'' b'4. vietnamese invasion of cambodia.' b'- genocide by khmer rouge.' b'- probably justifiable.' b'' b'5. iraq (desert storm)' b'- political expansionism, threat to world oil supply' b'- other factors such as genocide.' b'- not sure, but probably justifiable' b'' b'6. a future involvement in bosnia' b"- genocide so called 'ethnic cleansing'" b'- emotive much tv coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.' b'- probably justifiable' b'' b'7. possible future use of nuclear weapons tactical or strategic,' b'somewhere in the world by the us in response to someone else e.g. libya' b'or israel.' b'- my feelings in this are simple' b'- nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent' b"- i love the new zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear" b'armed or powered warships from nz port.' b'- never justifiable.' b'' b'these are my own views, i have looked at scripture, and i am confused. i' b'would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. i' b"*don't* want a naaahh, yer wrong i think answers b'' b'thanks for your help.' b'' b'==========================================================================' b'|' b'alastair thomson, phone b'chief programmer, fax b'the black albatross porject, b'university of otago, b'dunedin nextmail welcome' b'new zealand b'' b'"god loved the world so much, that he gave us his son, to die in' b'our place, so that we may have eternal life" john paraphrase' b'' b'=========================================================================='
