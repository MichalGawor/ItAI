b'' b'' b'hi. i think i have a problem with the stereo sound output on my quadra' b'900, but i am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem' b'on his powerbook any info or experience anyopne has would be' b'greatly appreciated.' b'' b'when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types' b'of sounds (mono, as far as i can tell) all play fine through both' b'speakers:' b'' b'system beeps (already provided ones such as indigo and ones i record)' b'' b'armor alley' b'spectre' b'spaceward ho!' b'' b'' b'but, the following games only play out of the left channel:' b'' b'lemmings' b'out of this world (awesome game, btw)' b'glider b'oids' b'' b'' b'but still, stereo system beeps do play in stereo, through both speakers.' b"(the one i'm specifically referrring to is apocolyptic beginning, which" b'my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))' b'' b'' b"all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates (he can't run" b"ootw because he doesn't have color)." b'' b"we're both running system b'' b'' b'' b'does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get' b'sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class, quadra, lc, powerbook or' b'greater, centris, se/30, etc... (stereo) machine?' b'' b'i used to have a mac ii, and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in' b'stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel. (i could be' b"mistaken, though. if there were a problem with the quad 900's and pb" b"170's, i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo? if there" b"isn't a problem with our machines, i wonder why the games above are" b'apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they' b'could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of' b'both speakers (like spectre, etc. do)?' b'' b"quadra 900's and powerbook 170's have the same roms (to my knowledge)," b"so maybe this is a rom problem? (if so, though, why wouldn't system b'patch over this problem?)' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'thanks for any help you can provide!' b'' b'' b'doug book'
