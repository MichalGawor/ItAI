b'' b'i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few' b'questions about windows for workgroups.' b'' b'i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with' b'windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. b'i am considering moving all our machines to w4wg.' b'' b'q1: how much conventional ram does w4wg use over and above the' b' driver for the network card?' b'' b'about 2.5kbyte without novell support.' b'' b'q2: if i have a novell ne2000 card, are the lsl and ipx drivers' b' still needed?' b'' b'no.' b'' b'q3: does w4wg do a license check over the network to ensure each' b' machine is running its own licenced copy of w4wg? (note: i do' b' not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy' b' of w4wg for each of our machines, it is just that i would like' b' to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. returning one' b' opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies.)' b'' b'no.' b'q4: if you buy the upgrade to windows for w4wg does it replace' b' all of win as you install it or does it depend on current' b' win files?' b'' b'nearly all.' b'' b'q5: if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out, will i have' b' any troubles with the w4wg machines?' b'' b'we run mixed wnt beta and w4wg, no problem apart from printer sharing( beta problem)' b'' b'when i started this message, i was going to ask only questions but i got carried' b"away. i'll stop now b'' b"we had problems with mouse drivers using w4wg where windows didn't, seems to be" b'more critical about it. it was actualy a port problem with the network card running on 0x2e0, we changed it to 0x300, now everything is allright, i think it has to do with the ami bios as well.' b'' b'i look forward to your replies.' b'' b'al' b'' b'--' b'alan walford eos systems inc., vancouver,b.c., canada tel: b'' b'' b'' b'---' b'network services snail: blackburn rd, clayton vic b'customised software solutions \t australia' b'center melbourne phone: fax: b''
