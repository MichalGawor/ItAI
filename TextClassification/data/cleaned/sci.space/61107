b'' b'other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..' b'why not??' b'' b'because to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where' b"it is, which means you either nail it to something that doesn't move" b'or you watch it all the time. neither of which is possible on a' b'deactivated spacecraft. then you have to know exactly how far away' b'from it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on' b'board.' b'' b'apart from which, there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons.' b'--' b"knox's is slick. fox in sox, on knox's box" b"knox's box is very quick. plays lots of lsl. he's sick!" b'(apologies to john "iron bar" mackin.)'
