b'' b'true, congress has said that possesion of an unlicensed automatic' b'weapon is a violation of the law. congress did not, however, say' b'that such possesion was a capital offense or a transgression worth' b'getting four good government agents killed and others wounded.' b'' b'' b'even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant,' b'but a search warrant. in other words, there was no evidence of illegal' b'arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to' b'search for illegal evidence.' b'' b'question: as in the rodney king case, will the us doj institute' b'criminal civil rights proceedings against the batf? or at least an' b'investigation? ok, sorry i asked.'
