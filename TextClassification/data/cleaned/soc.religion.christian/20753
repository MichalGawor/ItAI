b'' b': hi,' b'' b': i am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity.' b': i realize i am very ignorant about much of the bible and' b': quite possibly about what christians should hold as true. this i am trying' b': to rectify (by reading the bible of course), but it would be helpful' b': to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the bible or other' b': relevant aspects of the christian faith. one of my questions i would' b': like to ask is can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological' b': works intended for a lay person?' b'' b'i\'d recommend mcdowell\'s "evidence that demands a verdict" books i' b'think) and manfred brauch\'s "hard sayings of paul". he also may have' b'done "hard sayings of jesus". my focus would be for a new christian to' b'struggle with his faith and be encouraged by the historical evidence,' b'especially one who comes from a background which emphasizes knowable faith.' b'--' b'university registrar talk: fax: b'washington and lee university snail mail: lexington virginia
