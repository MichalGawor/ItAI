b'' b'' b'| i heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than' b'| gas engines because the emit less of: carbon monoxide,' b'| hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen. (co, hc, nox).' b'|' b'| but they can put out a lot of particulate matter. i heard' b'| something about legislation being discussed to "clean up' b'| diesel emissions". is there anything in the works to' b'| install "scrubbers" for diesels? how about the feasibility' b'| of installing them on trucks and cars? would it be any' b"| different than a catylitic converter? i'd assume easier," b"| since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting" b"| gasses. let's hear people's opinions..." b'' b'this really bugs me. the emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle,' b'but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars' b'in california. what a bunch of crap. diesel is the fuel of choice for' b"enviromental benefit in europe while here it's illegal for the same reason." b'' b'the particulates are nothing but carbon. they are just an annoyance at worst.' b'nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions, torque or engine' b"durability. it's also cheaper." b'' b'just to clear things up (as to why i posted the question that way)...' b'i was debating with a co-worker about diesels. i claimed they were' b'cleaner-burning than gas engines. he said the extra "junk" put out by them' b'was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses. i made all the same claims' b'you did. but, one question of his was what about the carbon? i said it' b'was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it. i suggested' b'scrubbers. (i figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install' b'than "cats".) does there exist any designs for a scrubber? (i\'d like' b'to know just to answer his final question.) i convinced him that diesels' b'are cleaner otherwise.' b'' b'btw, (i named my subject "dirty diesels" because i knew it would get a reaction' b"out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd" b'read it...)' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
