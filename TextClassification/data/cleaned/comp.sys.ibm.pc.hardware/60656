b'' b'' b"i'm running linux on an eisa system, and i'm having what i think are" b"hardware problems. it could be software, but i don't see why i'd be the" b"only one having trouble. i'd like some advice on how best to debug this." b'' b'the symptom: when i try to build gcc, i get unpredictable and unrepeatable' b'results. sometimes a .o file is not in valid a.out format. recompiling the' b'file gives me a valid binary. sometimes the compiler aborts or dumps core,' b'but works fine when run again with the same input. compiling the same' b'source files with the same arguments gives slight differences in a few' b'object files. (note that linux, unlike many other systems, does not put' b'timestamps in object files so compiling twice should give bit-identical' b'results.)' b'' b'i also have occasional filesystem corruption on my scsi drive, but that' b'could be caused by using development software. it could also be related to' b'my problems compiling. the compile problems are not caused by disk' b'problems: i get the same results whether i do my work on an ide or scsi' b'disk.' b'' b"i've set the memory speed and cache write speed to the recommended values." b'' b'recommended for what, dos? that is a junk.' b'' b'' b'i suspect the external cache, but i have no real evidence for this.' b'' b'the motherboard is a nice super-eisa with kb write-back cache and a dx/2' b'66 mhz processor.' b'' b"what i'm looking for:" b'' b'\t. a system test program to run under dos or linux' b'' b'linux gcc. fire up gcc to compile libc and kernel at the' b'same time running x11r5.' b'' b'' b'\t. suggestions about the cause of the problem' b'' b'bad memory, bad motherboard, bad cache.' b'' b'' b'\t. suggestions about how to debug the problem' b'' b'' b'change wait state of ram.' b'turn off turbo.' b'change bus speed' b'swap ram.' b'' b'' b'h.j.'
