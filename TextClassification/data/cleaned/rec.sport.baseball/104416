b'' b'' b'' b'one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the' b'split probably somewhere around and b'' b" i'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe or" b' even give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds' b" identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and" b" even if you don't let roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot" b' more than the oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (no offense,' b' gordon).' b'' b"i wouldn't give baserunning that much value." b'' b'the above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well. if' b'olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if alomar legs an' b'extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold' b"at third. thus olerud's doubles have more advancement value than" b"alomar's. (of course, alomar is more likely to score after hitting a" b'double.)' b'' b'another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that' b'the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams. no' b"team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players" b'than others. still, the current runs created formulas work just as well' b"in the 1950's for all teams." b'' b'bill james gives the senators as an example. they used harmon' b'killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in stole bases with' b'38 times caught stealing. yet they scored slightly more runs than' b'predicted by runs created.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'"we are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary."' b'"please rotate your phone degrees and try again."' b'disclaimer: i speak for no one and no one speaks for me.'
