b'' b' dear mr. beyer:' b'' b' it is never wise to confuse "freedom of speech" with "freedom"' b' of racism and violent deragatory."' b'' b' it is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial' b' distinction.' b'' b'in fact, if a speach was not offensive to some, its' b'protection under freedom of speach laws would be useless. it is' b'speach that some find questionable that must be protected, be' b'it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist. it is only' b'through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can' b'enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant. that is the' b'idea behind freedom of expression.' b'what you find offensive might be perceived as truth by' b'some and what they might find offensive might be your belief.' b'it is only through free exchange of ideas (and insults as the' b'case seems to be with this channel) that one can change' b"another's erring ways.that is why jefferson said that here" b'we are not afraid to "tolerate error so long as reason is left to' b'combat it".'
