b'///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////' b'' b"...then continue reading (contents of the current release's readme):" b'' b'xm++ is a user interface framework for the c++ language built upon x11' b'and the x-toolkit. it is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming' b'interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.' b'xm++ was initially created for the motif widget set, now support for the' b'athena widgets was added. applications created with xm++ run in both' b'environments without changes, although many nice features are only' b'available when using motif.' b'in some situations xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing' b'a combobox borrowed from ms-windows), but never tries to replace it b'data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated' b'in rare cases.' b'' b'xm++ has nothing common with motif++ besides the general idea to' b"encapsulate motif widgets in c++ objects and the in it's name. many" b"ideas for the xm++ architecture came from digitalk's smalltalk version," b'which provides an easy to use framework for windows/pm/mac applications' b'(in the very first time of development i used the windows dialog editor and' b'a simple parser to create similar smalltalk and xm++ dialogs b'' b'top level objects in xm++:' b"* 'windows', 'systemdialogs' and 'toolboxes' which use the automatic layout" b'feature of various composite widgets in motif and xaw' b"* 'userdialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface" b'builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this' b'distribution)' b'' b'controls (children of top level objects):' b"'statictext', 'staticimage', 'pushbutton', 'checkbox', 'radiobutton'," b"'edit', 'listbox', 'combobox', 'groupbox', 'panearea', 'drawing', 'toolbar'" b'' b'the staticimage and all the button classes can display b/w (x-bitmap' b'format) or color (gif format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.' b'' b'event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects' b'xt callbacks to member functions of xm++ objects.' b'' b'' b'commoninteract(ii) is built upon the xm++ drawing class and provides' b'components for building direct manipulative applications. is is a very' b'simplified implementation of some features from the commoninteract system' b'(research project of our institute in an approach to define a' b'software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications' b'with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).' b'if you are interrested, look into the june issue of the joop (sigs' b'publications journal of object oriented programming) there should be' b"our paper about commoninteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of" b"the art' from b'commoninteract(ii) is still undocumented and is included because it was' b'used to implement the dialog editor. it currently supports only drawing' b'primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to' b'support bitmaps and some controls also.' b'known problem: the xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always' b'redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an' b'object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.' b'' b'' b'about this first release:' b'' b'xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here' b'for smaller applications which are running without problems. so i think' b"i can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications" b'for any non-critical purposes.' b"commoninteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. it's development will" b'be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research' b'project here. besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems' b'to be stable and can be used for experimental applications.' b'' b'platforms: this release was compiled and tested on:' b'hp9000/720 running hp-ux b'sun sparc running sunos release b'pc-at386 running linux v0.99pl6' b'' b'caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an at&t' b'standard c++ compiler this release is tested only with gnu g++ or' b'above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).' b'' b'where to get it:' b'================' b'' b'i have uploaded it on: export.lcs.mit.edu as:
