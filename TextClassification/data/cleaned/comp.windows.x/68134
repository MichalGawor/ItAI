b'' b'|' b'| *but* your performance will suck lemons running an xserver on a clone.' b'| b'| i have a clone almost with no name generating 91k xstones on a 486/33mhz' b'| system.' b'| b'| b'| i can get tektronix xp11 terminals for under and the performance' b'| is over xstones.....' b'| b'| you will not come even close to the performance of an xp10 series, plus you' b'| b'| excuse me, but with a 256k cache, s3 isa card, 8mb xs3 (x11r5) running 386bsd you can get 100k+ xstones at 1024x768 65mhz which i doubt' b'|' b'| this is hardly apples to apples. try running the benchmark over a' b"| network to the clone and, and if you're still getting 100k xstones" b"| then you've got a good machine. x terminals aren't just a server you know....." b'|' b'| \tgraeme gill.' b'' b'i would further add that a 486/50,s3/928,8mb,15",200mbdisk is going to cost' b'/way/ more than probably color makes it not apples/apples too.' b'xterminals provide better price/performance than pcs. you can make a pc' b"much cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make pc's perform great, and" b'cost more. you pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability' b'of a pc. for home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.' b'' b'-kelly murray'
