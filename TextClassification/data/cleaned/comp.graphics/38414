b'' b'i have the ati graphics ultra pro eisa version. i must admit it has' b'received bad press but that was due to the faulty drivers it had.' b'' b'pc magazine seems to be impressed with the ati card in their most recent' b'reviews. in the april 13th issue they rate the ati graphics ultra pro' b'(eisa version) as their "editor\'s choice". they noted that the drivers' b'had improved since they tested the isa version in january...' b' ...cuyler' b'yeah they also gave it their "editor\'s choice" in the run-down of' b'graphics accelerators they tested in the previous issue, which is why' b'i bought (and then returned) mine. the only conclusion i can come up with' b'is that pc magazine has wildly different ways on determining the worthiness' b'of a video card than i do.' b'' b'--' b'david farley the university of chicago library' b'312 east 57th street, jrl-210' b''
