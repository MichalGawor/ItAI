b'' b' oh, this all sounds so nice! everyone helping each other and always smiling' b' and fluffy bunnies everywhere. wake up! people are just not like that. it' b' seems evident from history that no society has succeeded when it had to rely' b" upon the goodwill and unselfishness of the people. isn't it obvious from" b' places like iran that even if there are only a few greedy people in society' b' then they are going to be attracted to positions of power? sounds like a' b' recipe for disaster.' b'' b"looking at historical evidence such 'perfect utopian' islamic states" b"didn't survive. i agree, people are people, and even if you might" b'start an islamic revolution and create this perfect state, it takes' b'some time and the internal corruption will destroy the ground rules b'again.' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
