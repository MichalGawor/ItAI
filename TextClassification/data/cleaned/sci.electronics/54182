b'' b"it isn't the average temperature that is the key factor here, but rather" b'which is better at transferring the heat out of the (presumably warmer' b'than ground temperature) battery...' b'' b'uh, bob, why is the battery warmer than ground temperature? on the time' b'scales in question, and with the considerably reduced temperature swings' b"several feet underground, there isn't going to be any major temperature" b"difference between the battery and what it's sitting on." b'' b'... question why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the' b'surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it?' b'' b'because the temperature of your hand, *unlike that of the battery*, is' b'determined by the balance between internal heat production and external' b"heat loss. you're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object" b'(your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings. in the case' b'of an object with no significant internal heat production, this will' b'affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if' b"it started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final" b'temperature.' b'' b'for the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not' b'whether water will freeze.' b'--'
