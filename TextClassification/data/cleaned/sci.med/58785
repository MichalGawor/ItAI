b'' b'|' b'| here is another anecdotal story. i am a picky eater and never wanted to' b'| try chinese food, however, i finally tried some in order to please a' b'| girl i was seeing at the time. i had never heard of chinese restaurant' b'| syndrome. a group of us went to the restaurant and all shared different' b"| dishes. it didn't taste great, but i decided it wasn't so bad. we went" b'| home and went to bed early. i woke up at am and puked my guts outs.' b"| i threw up for so long that (i'm not kidding) i pulled a muscle in" b"| my tongue. dry heaves and everything. no one else got sick, and i'm" b'| not allergic to anything that i know of.' b'|' b'| suffice to say that i wont go into a chinese restaurant unless i am' b'| physically threatened. the smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is*' b'| a psycholgical reaction). when i have been dragged in to suffer' b'| through beef and broccoli without any sauces, i insist on no msg.' b"| i haven't gotten sick yet." b'|' b'| b'' b'i had a similar reaction to chinese food but came to a completly different' b"conclusion. i've eaten chinese food for ages and never had problems. i went" b'with some chinese malaysian friends to a swanky chinses rest. and they ordered' b'lots of stuff i had never seen before. the only thing i can remember of that' b'meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce.' b'i thought, "well, i\'ve only had scallops once and i was sick after but that' b'could have been a coincidence". that night as i sat on the bathroom floor,' b'sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, i decided i would never touch' b"another scallop. i may not be allergic but i don't want to take the chance." b'' b'amy mossman'
