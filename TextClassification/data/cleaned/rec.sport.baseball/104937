b'' b'sorry, i gotta disagree here. last time i played ball, i went up on' b'several occasions intending to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the' b"runner from third or advance a runner to third. it's relatively easy" b'actually... you swing under the path of the ball you normally would to' b"hit a good line drive. with fastballs it's very easy, much more" b'difficult with good breaking balls. a good hitter with excellent bat' b'control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least, oh, b'of the time? maybe more..' b'' b"there's a blurb in the stats scoreboard about this, and though i don't have" b'the book with me here, my memory is that the best at hitting sac flies were' b'far below this number.' b'' b'sherri nichols'
