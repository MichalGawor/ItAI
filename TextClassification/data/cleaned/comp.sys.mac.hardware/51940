b'' b'i recently made the mistake of purchasing a sony cpd-1320 monitor for my' b'mac iici. the monitor is very good, however it seems that the iici does not' b'support vga (then why did you buy it you ask? i am stupid i reply). what i' b'am looking for is a video card, preferably bit, which supports vga. i am' b'interested in any information i can get. offers for the sale of applicable' b'cards will also be considered.' b'' b'thanks in advance.' b'' b'' b'' b'jim pyke'
