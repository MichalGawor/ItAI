b'' b'' b'i used to be a marriage commissioner for the alaska court' b'system (sort of a justice of the peace). i had great difficulty' b'with that duty. i used to pray earnestly in the courthouse' b'bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples' b'would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and' b"divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize" b"that marriage is god's institution, not the state's. gradually," b'however, i came to conclude that because i was acting in a' b'strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both' b'the state and the expectations of the couples involved, i was' b'really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no' b'greater moral or religious implications than if i had been' b'conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,' b'to "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion).' b'' b'i thought i had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp' b'distinction between marriage before god, and "marriage" before' b'the state, until i had to deal with my own divorce. keeping' b'matthew in mind, i felt that the state had no business' b'dissolving my marriage established before god, but of course it' b'assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.' b'' b'i would ask those of you proposing answers to this' b"question to consider this issue's logical extension: if" b'intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the' b'ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes' b'marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?' b'' b'karl thoennes iii' b'university of alaska'
