b'' b'' b'' b'| i am writing a program which needs to draw colour xpm pixmap files onto a background without having the borders show up. i cannot do xor as the colours all stuff up. i cannot use xcopyplane() as that is for single planes only. i want to be able to specify a colour in the pixmap to be used as the opaque colour. is this possible.' b'|' b'| games such as xjewel have the same problem. how does the mouse pointer do it?' b'|' b'| any help would be helpful? b'|' b'' b'you wanna do masking. build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels' b'you name "opaque" are (that get copied) and the others are use this' b'bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for xcopyarea(), and remember to' b'adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the xcopyarea() blit origin.' b'' b'the mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using ramdac analog' b'mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.' b'' b'but be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask' b'is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at mips...' b'' b'--' b'+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+' b'| o brain inside o b'| o o b'+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+'
