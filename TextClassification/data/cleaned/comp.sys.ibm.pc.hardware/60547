b'' b'i have just installed a diamond stealth isa card in' b"a '486dx2-66 system with 256k cache, and megs of memory," b'that gets about a si cpu benchmark rating. using' b'the 1024x768x16 color driver under windows, i am getting a' b'winbench winmarks rating of only about million. since' b'i have heard that others get 15-to-16 million for this card,' b'i assume that something is very wrong with my setup.' b'' b'what are some possible causes of the card slowing down like this?' b'' b'i ran the qualitas asq diagnostic program on memory, and i noted' b'the following memory timings on my machine:' b'' b'asq v1.30 by qualitas system analysis mon apr 11:43:49am page: b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'access timing' b'' b'hex kb kb access speed ratio b'start start size time us b'' b'00000 b'00800 b'01000 b'01800 b'02000 b'03000 b'03800 b'05800 b'07000 b'07800 b'08000 b'09800 b'0a000 b'0b800 b'0c000 b'0c800 b'0e000 b'0f000 b'' b'note two things on this chart:' b'' b'1) the video memory appears to be many orders of magnitude slower than' b'system memory. are there wait states being inserted here, and what would' b'cause that?' b'' b'2) the ems page frame seems to be ridiculously slow, even though' b'it is being mapped to the fast xms memory in my system through' b"emm386. what's going on there?" b'' b"note that my stealth 24's video bios at c000-c7ff is being shadowed" b'through the ami bios.' b'' b'any ideas on what might be happening here?' b'' b'--'
