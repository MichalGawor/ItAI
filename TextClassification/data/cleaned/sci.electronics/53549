b'' b"that's scary if there's a way to set an arbitrary mileage figure" b"into the odometer, you can't trust *any* odometer reading, even" b'if you can prove that the odometer itself is the same one that' b'came on the car originally.' b'' b'i was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these' b'electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage? what kind of' b'memory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough' b'(of outside battery power) to last say, years or more, in the life of a' b"vehicle? i'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for" b'this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos i work with that' b'are doing good to work for months without breaking down somehow).' b'' b'side question: how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with' b'a replaced odometer that starts over at miles, after say 100/200/300k' b'actual miles. looks like fraud would be fairly easy for the price of a' b'new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the' b'buyer it has.' b'' b'thanks for any insight.' b'' b'' b'kim greer' b'div. nuclear medicine pob 3949\t\t voice: b'durham, nc \t\t fax:
