b'' b'hi, netters:' b'' b"we have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process" b'#if clause in c preprocessor statements. it evaluates everything to' b'true no matter what the conditionals are.' b'for example, makedepend chokes on one of x11 include files (as distributed' b'by sun) namely xos.h:' b'' b'#if !defined(sunos41) defined(__stdc__)' b'# include <string.h' b'# define index strchr' b'# define rindex strrchr' b'#else bsd !__stdc__ b'# include <strings.h' b'#endif !sunos41 __stdc__ b'' b"here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements" b"to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h which doesn't exist" b'under solaris2.' b'we also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.' b"we got and built 'makedepend' off the net it didn't fix the problem." b'' b"in all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (sun's" b'distribution) mentions this problem:' b'' b'bugs' b'if you do not have the source for cpp, the berkeley c' b'preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way' b'that all #if directives will evaluate to "true" regardless' b'of their actual value. this may cause the wrong #include' b'directives to be evaluated. makedepend should simply have' b'its own parser written for #if expressions.' b'' b"has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than" b'writeyourownparser... and willing to share it with us?' b'' b'since we often experience delays in our newsfeed please reply' b"directly to my e-mail address i'll post a summary." b'' b'thanks in advance.' b'***************************************************************************' b'* michael turok b'* fifth avenue voice: ext.7531 b'* waltham, ma usa fax: b'***************************************************************************'
