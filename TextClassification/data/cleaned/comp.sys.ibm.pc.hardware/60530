b'' b'' b"i can't imagine why someone would leave their computer on all of" b'the time to start with. its like leaving your lights tv, radio' b'and everything in the house on all of the time to me.....nuts' b'' b'' b'we have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the' b"time. i don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the" b'offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. in fact, some' b'of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the' b"offices. but it goes both ways so can't conclude anything." b'' b'thomas.' b''
