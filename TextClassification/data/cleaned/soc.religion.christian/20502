b'' b'i seldom see any posts in this group. is anyone out there in christendom' b"listening? if so, why don't we get some dialog going here?" b'' b"here's a topic to get things started. my daughter's christian school sends" b'home a weekly update on school related topics. this week they sent' b'something *very* interesting. it was an article written by the leader of a' b'national (us) christian school organization about a trip he recently made' b'to jerusalem. while there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is' b'working on a project to rebuild the temple at jerusalem. the article' b'included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in' b'preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the' b'specifications given in the bible.' b'' b'what was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are' b'complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the israeli' b'government before beginning the building. the other startling fact is the' b'very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is' b'unoccupied and available for building. previously it has been thought that' b'the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding' b'impossible without sparking a holy war.' b'' b'now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming' b'sacrifices, as the scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.' b'although the israeli government will give the permission to start, i think' b'it is the hand of god holding the project until he is ready to let it' b'happen. brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. our redemption is' b'drawing near. look up!' b'' b'[postings are in the range of to per day, except weekends.' b"if people aren't seeing that, we've got propagation problems. --clh]"
