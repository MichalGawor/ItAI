b'' b'' b'i just recently realized that i am bisexual, and also just recently returned to' b'religion, and have a good friend who has pointed out to me that homosexuality' b"is a sin in the bible. well, i don't see how it could be considered a sin," b'' b'first of all as far as i know, only male homosexuality is explicitly' b"mentioned in the bibles, so you're off the hook there, i think. in" b'any event, there are *plenty* of people in many denominations who' b"do not consider a person's sexual identification of gay/lesbian/bisexual" b'as an "immoral lifestyle choice"' b'' b'also, i have always been a somewhat liberal feminist, and am pro-choice, and it' b"seems that being pro-choice and being religious don't mix either. i am told" b'' b'this is another misconception. you are not being told the whole story.' b'' b'my former minister is a lesbian, and i know personally and' b'professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers. i am' b'a unitarian-universalist and like most others in my denomination,' b"am pro-choice. you needn't go looking to the unitarian universalists" b'(which is a liberal religion) for acceptance of your sexual' b'identification and pro-choice views, however; there are many of us' b'who believe in spirituality and freedom of conscience.' b'' b'good luck on your journey!' b'' b'--' b"daniel o'connell" b'meadville/lombard theological school' b'university of chicago divinity school'
