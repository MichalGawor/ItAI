b'' b'' b"\tif you know much about pc's (ibm comp) you might try the joystick" b"port. though i haven't tried this myself, i've been told that the port" b'has built in a-d converters. this would allow the joystick to be a couple of' b'pots. if you could find the specs this might just work for you...' b'' b'i guess 100k, connecting pins (1x), (1y), (2x), and (2y).' b'' b'or: get an 8-bit da-converter (merely a couple of transistors and' b'resistors) and an opamp to compare its output to the voltage you want to' b'measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do' b'the rest by software (stepwise refinement). the port addresses for your' b'printer ports are probably: &h378 (lpt1), &h278 (lpt2). this should work' b'well enough for your purposes.' b'' b'hope this helps' b'' b'--' b'gmd, schloss birlinghoven, postfach d-5205 st. augustin frg' b''
