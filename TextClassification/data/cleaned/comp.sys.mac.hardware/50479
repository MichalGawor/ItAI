b'' b"i've got the official word on the laserwriter pro memory" b'upgrade.' b'' b'i just got off of the phone with the quite friendly donna rossi' b'at apple customer assistance. she tells me that those who' b'purchased the laserwriter pro in a megabyte (300dpi, no' b'greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers' b'who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade. for those' b"who don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi" b'or greyscale (at 300dpi).' b'' b'if the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their' b'hardware support numbers and/or apple customer assistance' b'1-800-776-2333, (corporate number).' b'' b'regards,' b'' b'glenn' b'' b"p.s. personally, i'm annoyed at our school bookstore. they" b'really have an obligation to provide this information to all' b'of the customers who purchased the in the original' b"configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask for" b'things like a phone number). when i get my upgrade completed,' b"i'm going to write apple and complain."
