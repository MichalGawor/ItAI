b'' b'microsoft is the largest software company on the planet, yet i cannot think' b'of even *one* computing concept that they innovated and brought to market' b'before anyone else. xerox-parc/apple, osborne, next, gnu and others have' b'been pioneers and led the way to the future of computing. what has' b'microsoft done to be a technological leader? i posted this question before,' b'but i got nary a reply. i make the challenge now to anyone who can come up' b'with something-especially microsoft employees. i get no response this time,' b'i guess it pretty much assures me that there is none--which is what i' b'suspect anyway.' b'' b'really when you come down to it who cares. i just hope ms keeps doing' b'what they do best getting usable productive software to the masses.' b'thx dave l' b'' b''
