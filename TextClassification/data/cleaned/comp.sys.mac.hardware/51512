b'' b'' b'a while ago i posted a note asking for specs on the quadra and opinions on' b'the q700 upgrade of a iici vs. an accelerator card. so far no responsed that' b"i've noticed. please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade" b'paths: cost, efficiency, pros/cons, etc.. thanks!' b'' b'complete q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent' b'copy of macworld or macuser. my foggy memory suggests that the most relevant' b'comparison factors vis-a-vis a iici are as follows:' b'' b'25 mhz b"16 mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower" b'than q style machines for sure).' b'ethertalk card on-board' b'audio in/out' b'4 mb ram on motherboard' b'4 simm slots' b'2 nubus slots.' b'more flexible build-in video than the ci. uses vram.' b'' b"in comparison, a iici with an accelerator won't give you" b'audio or ethernet or the same video options.' b'with a accelerator, cpu performance can be comparable but i' b'think it ends up costing more.' b'' b'greg dudek'
