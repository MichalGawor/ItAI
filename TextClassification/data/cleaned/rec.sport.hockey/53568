b'' b'' b'|' b"| \tthe presence of the new team in miami(i can't say south florida;" b"| it's too long) makes me think of an interesting question. can you sell" b'| the hispanic community on hockey? miami is hispanic. this' b'| community' b'| has no experience and no previous exposure to hockey that i know of.' b'| the' b'| teams in ny and la which also have big hispanic groups do not seem to' b'| try' b'| to woo this group. what will miami do? could they get spanish-language' b'| tv and radio coverage?' b'|' b'' b"you'll have a hard time selling any sport to a community that" b"can't play it on account of availability or financial reasons." b'hockey is pretty much a sport for the white and well off.' b'' b'well, suffice to say that it is a sport for those able to make the' b"substantial investment in equipment, etc. but here's something, do" b'you think that the availability of in-line skates and road hockey' b'could contribute to a rise in awareness of ice hockey? i would' b'argue this is having an effect here. kids play ice hockey in the' b'winter and road hockey in the summer with in-line skates.' b''
