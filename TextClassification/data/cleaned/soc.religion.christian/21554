b'' b'' b"really? you may be right, but i'd like proof. as far as i know (and" b'i am not a div school student!) the catholic church does not seem to' b'accept predestination. my chaplain told me "beware of greeks bearing' b'gifts" with reference to this doctrine: it seems to have the curious' b'result that human beings are not held responsible for their own' b"actions! i'll answer how you deal with this in a minute." b'' b'the catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in' b'any way. since god knows everything, he therefore knows everything that' b'is going to happen to us. we have free will, and are able to change' b'what happens to us. however, since god knows everything, he knows all' b'the choices we will make "in advance" (god is not subject to time). too' b'often arguments pit predestination against free will. we believe in' b'both.' b'' b'-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-' b'steve creps, indiana university'
