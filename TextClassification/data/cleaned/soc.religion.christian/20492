b'' b'' b'i am doing a dormitory bible "discussion" with my christian roommate and' b'2 of the non-christian guys on my floor. they are very close to' b'accepting christ, so we have started to disciple them (treat them like' b'baby believers) and go into more indepth subjects than the parables, etc.' b'our first discussion was on prayer. eventually, we got around to how' b"we should pray in jesus' name. then, an excellent question came up, one" b'that i don\'t have a real answer to. the question was, "if we need to pray' b"in jesus' name, what about the people before jesus? they prayed to god" b"and he listened then, in spite of their sins. why can't it be the same" b'way now?"' b'' b"i'll take a try at this..." b'' b'from the discussions i have been in, and from how *i* have interpreted' b'the bible, i feel that one can pray either way. but remember this,' b'before jesus, the people talked to god (no other way) and he talked' b'back. (audible and dreams, etc.) today we have the bible to know' b'gods will, and we have his son you died for us. he was given as our' b'savior, and while we still do things according to gods will, we pray' b'through his son. in the bible it says that if we are not known to' b'jesus, we are not known to god. (sorry i do not have the verses' b'with me) so, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present' b'ourselves to jesus first, who will then present us to god.' b'' b'leonard' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'' b'===========================================================================' b'-this space intentionally left blank.'
