b'' b'' b'the best home run i have *ever* seen came off, believe it or not,' b'roger clemens (sorry, val) a couple of years ago. he threw a ball to' b"incaviglia which was literally at inky's neck, and he absolutely" b'hammered the crap out of it. after the swing, clemens nonchalantly' b"motioned for a new ball--he didn't even turn around to look, or" b'even get upset. the ball hit the lights in the left-field standard,' b'some or so feet about the green monster (over feet above the' b'ground total!)' b'' b'truly an amazing shot.' b'' b'i agree. home runs off clemens are always memorable. kinda like' b"eclipses and hurricanes. they don't happen very often." b'' b'cheers,' b'-valentine'
