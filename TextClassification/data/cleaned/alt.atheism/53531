b'' b'' b'khomeini advocates the view that' b' there was a series of twelve islamic leaders (the twelve imams) who' b' are free of error or sin. this makes him a heretic.' b'' b'' b"wow, you're quicker to point out heresy than the church in the" b"middle ages. seriously though, even the sheiks at al-azhar don't" b"claim that the shi'ites are heretics. most of the accusations" b"and fabrications about shi'ites come out of saudi arabia from the" b'wahabis. for that matter you should read the original works of' b'the sunni imams (imams of the four madhabs). the teacher of' b'at least two of them was imam jafar sadiq (the sixth imam of the' b"shi'ites)." b'' b'although there is plenty of false propaganda floating around' b"about the shi'ites (esp. since the revolution), there are also" b"many good works by shi'ites which present the views and teachings" b'of their school. why make assumptions and allegations (like' b"people in this group have done about islam in general) about shi'ites."
