b'' b"the parable of the prodigal son is not about who is and who isn't an" b'immoral person. it is about grace and the love of god. most people' b'would agree with that concerning the younger son. the elder son is' b'simply a negative example of the some thing. he thinks that he must' b"earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled" b'to it. his father tells him that he is on the wrong track. he has always' b'been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is' b"his father's son." b'' b'we are too performance oriented to consistently get the point. we are' b'willing to be saved by grace, but once we are christians we want to' b'go back to earning and deserving.' b'' b'"are you so foolish? after beginning with the spirit, are you now trying' b'to attain your goal by human effort?" gal niv' b'--' b"stan armstrong. religious studies dept, saint mary's university, halifax, n.s."
