b'' b'hi netters,' b'' b'as promised, here are the summary of opinions on doubledisk gold v.6.0.' b'people seem to be quite happy with the product. there is no much of' b'opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader stacker b'(superstor pro is not considered since it is slower than stacker although' b"just as reliable byte magazine's conclusion so it's hard to make" b'any decision to go with stacker or with doubledisk gold v6.0.' b'however, it seems that at it is quite a buy.' b'' b'buddy christyono' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'summary of replies' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'hello buddy,' b'' b'i do not have dd gold experience. i just ordered it. i currently have' b'dd (the last version). i am very pleased with its performance.' b'' b'here is my suggestion...' b'' b'1) if you do not have any compression software currently, i would go with' b"dos 6.0's compression. all the discussion on the net indicates that" b'for you get the compression (built into the os), plus the other' b'utilities that you would pay way more than for. besides, you' b'are now at dos6.0 (whatever that means...)' b'' b'2) if you have doubledisk already (like i do), the cost is b'for the upgrade. after thinking about it and asking the net, i' b'decided that i could not go wrong with the update cost!' b'i have never suffered from performance of dd. i have a 12ms hd with' b'large sw packages in both compressed and uncompressed format. it' b'works great. not delays. i think the "a" is better than "b"' b'arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.' b'i am looking forward to being able to "loadhigh" the dd sw. that' b'has been an annoyance.' b'' b'3) if you have stacker, et.al. currently, i would not see it worth the' b'effort to upgrade.' b'' b'just my b'' b'regards,' b'mark bagdy' b'----------------------------------------------------------------' b'buddy,' b'' b'i got the same mailer. about weeks ago i got ddg and installed it. the' b'documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. i used the automatic' b'installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.' b'' b'there were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max' b'& qemm. ddg has an uninstall (unlike dos6.0) if you need it. my system has a' b'203mb hard drive. before installing ddg i had ~5mb free. after ddg i had' b'~197mb free. pretty good statistics considering that my 8mb permanent windows' b'swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and' b'such).' b'' b'i have had no problems whatsoever. i have noticed no slowdown (other than it' b'takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. so far i am a very' b'happy camper.' b'' b'-bruce' b'--' b'bruce f. steinke "never know when you\'re going to' b'software technical support engineer sam gamgee' b'evans sutherland computer corp. <my mail, my opinions' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'i have been using doubledisk gold for a little more than a month on' b'a 486dx 33mhz, 120mb seagate drive, running dos windows in enhanced' b'mode.' b'i ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a doubledisk drive' b'with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.' b'i have no complaints about reliability. it was very easy to install.' b'the only problem i had was with castle wolfenstein 3-d. i assumed the game' b'was trying to bypass dos disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed' b'region of the disk. since then the game has never given me a problem.' b'there was never any damage to the doubledisk drive.' b'compression performance for the whole disk has held steady' b'around this is lower than expected but about (size) of my files' b'are compressed image files and some large zip files.' b'' b'if you have any more specific questions let me know.' b'dan' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'i bought it an have been happy with it. i use it on both mfm and ide b'mb drives. i was using doubledisk before gold came out. that is the' b'same product msdos is shipping with. no problems with either' b'product.' b'' b'--' b'///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////' b'-------------------- end of messages
