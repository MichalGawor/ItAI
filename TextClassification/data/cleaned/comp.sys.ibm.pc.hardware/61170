b'' b'i have an internal modem that i configure as com4 with irq but' b'when i insert that card into my dos pc, it shows up' b"as com3, with irq3 and com4's address (2e8)!" b'' b'when i get into debug, and dump the data at it shows' b'the address 2e8 as belonging to com3 even though the modem' b'should be at com4.' b'...' b'' b'this is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers,' b'and users alike. com3, for example, is simply the third equipped comm' b'port, not necessarily the one with i/o address 3e8. the bios just' b'searches sequentially through a set of potential comm port addresses. the' b"first equipped port it finds will become com1, etc. if you're playing by" b"the rules, you can't have a com4 unless you have a com3 equipped. the set" b'of "standard" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the' b'order in which the bios searches the i/o address space in its search for' b'serial ports.' b'' b'so, what you have is indeed com3 at the non-standard address 2e8. were' b'this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the bios' b'to determine the number of installed comm ports would not find it, as the' b'field in the bios data area which contains this number would indicate that' b"there are but comm ports installed. (frankly, i don't know of a simgle" b'program that would actually have a problem with this.)' b'' b'--' b'bob nichols' b'at&t bell laboratories'
