b'' b'' b'i have a gateway 4dx-33v with my inch floppy as drive a. i' b'accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from one particular' b'box of diskettets in the a drive when i boot up, rather than getting' b'the "non-system diskette" message, the machine hangs and the cmos' b'gets overwritten (luckily, gateway sends a print of the standard' b'cmos settings with their systems). this only happens with a box' b'of pre-formatted fuji disks that i have, no other disks cause this' b'problem. if i re-format one of the fuji disks, the problem goes away.' b'i did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing.' b'' b'anyone have any idea what is going on here? hardware problem? a' b"virus that can't be detected? the system reading in garbage from" b'the boot sector?' b'' b'--'
