b'' b" a rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, so" b" they don't have any immediate financial interest), told me that" b' they have been having lots of problems with their centris b" he didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with the" b' floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files.' b' it sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems' b' and software compatibility problems with the machine.' b' [deleted]' b' so, what does the net think? did the dealer just get one flaky' b' machine, or did apple send the c610 out the door too early?' b' is your c610 working just great, or is it buggy too?' b'' b"a lot of the time, when you're dealing with someone who has no financial" b'interest in selling you the machine, you get a lot of opinion (as opposed' b'to factual information, etc.). what it sounds like to me is that this guy' b'has had an experience with one flaky centris and formed an' b"all-encompassing opinion on the rest of the 610's. i've seen lots of" b'people who frustrated me to no end because they refused to believe any' b'other mac xyz would be any good, since their experience (with one<' b'machine) with a mac xyz had been bad. their loss, eh?' b'' b'andrew w. duthie'
