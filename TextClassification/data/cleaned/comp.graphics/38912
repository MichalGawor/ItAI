b'' b"my wife wants to publish a newsletter. she's no artist, so she intends to" b'use comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a box' b'around it etc.' b'' b'we have mspublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doing' b"much with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. right now she's" b'looking at corel draw and harvard draw. there seem to be more books in the' b"stores on corel than on harvard, so she's inclined to go with corel on the" b'basis of popularity. can anyone give us an informed opinion on which' b'package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative' b'available? if this is a faq, please withhold the flames and just send the' b'location of the faq document. thanks.' b'' b"three ps's:" b'' b'1) is it ok to use clip art from harvard draw or whatever for commercial' b'purposes?' b'' b'2) we have a dpi laser jet printer. what would be a good scanner for' b'reading in paper clipart?' b'' b'3) how about someone starting up a newsgroup on desktop publishing if one' b"doesn't exist?"
