b'' b"| can someone out there explain exactly what the 'trigger'" b'| feature found on oscilloscopes does?' b'| b'| \t{ lots og good explanation deleted}' b'' b'<lots more deleted' b'| \tis it just me, or does anybody else out there not like digital' b'| scopes. my school has some beauutful 100mhz hp that are digital with' b'| all the bells and whistles, including soft-keys, which i think are a' b"| loveley touch. that is, software keys. you don't forget that you" b'| are dealing with a computer. those scopes even with all their' b'| neatness, still make the ickyest looking waves. lotsa features, but' b"| ugly output. and those are the best digitals i have ever seen. i've" b'| seen a lot of cheaper digitals and they look terrible.' b'' b'i think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much' b'more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and' b'some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,' b'in a counter-intuitive fashion (hp has made some strides in their' b'54600 series, imo). automatic setups are fine for simple,' b'repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more' b'complex events where you need to understand how the scope is' b'actually measuring/processing the event. for example, is the scope' b'in "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent time' b'being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to' b"the trigger event each sweep)? what was the scope's actual sampling" b'rate at the time? how is the data being massaged after capture but' b'before display, etc. one common misconception is the speed of the scope.' b'' b"is the hp scope you're using really a mhz scope? or is it a mhz" b'sample rate scope mhz single shot significance) whose front' b'end including s/h can support mhz waveforms (important for' b'equivalent time sampling)? the mhz input in this case really' b'only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single' b'sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.' b'' b'so, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get' b'useful information from a digital scope. i prefer an analog scope for' b'general use and the digital for events where i need storage for' b'later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability' b'of the scope. now, for the price of true mhz digital scopes to' b'fall...' b'' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------' b'dave medin\t\t\tphone:\t(205) (w)' b'ssd--networking\t\t\t\t(205) (h)' b'intergraph corp.' b'huntsville, al 35894\t\tuucp: ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin' b'' b'******* everywhere you look (at least around my office) b'' b'* the opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)'
