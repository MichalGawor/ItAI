b'' b" i didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, i" b' just wanted to add a point.' b'' b'..' b' then enforces those rights for them. here in the u.s., the constitution' b' provides a "bill of rights" from which most if not all legal rights are' b" considered to derive. i'm sure that most other countries have" b'' b'these seem hardly like the groups to discuss this in, but huh???' b'all legitimate power to enforce these rights derives from the consent' b"of the governed, not from no steenkin' piece of paper. civilized gov'mnt" b"is not an autonomous computer program, it's interactive. the constitution" b"was made by the people and can be trashed by us it ain't no sacred" b"scripture from which rights flow. our 'rights' come from our souls." b"and i sure didn't see any request to vote on trashing the sky." b'again my opinion only we keep our rights by using them, not going to' b'some court.' b'' b' comparable documents. if you can persuade a court that you have a right' b' to a dark sky derived in some manner from the bill of rights (in the' b' u.s.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched. to' b' keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law' b' and the international court of justice (correct name?) in the hague,' b' something i know little about.' b'' b' doug loss' b'' b'' b'most gracious regards,' b'whh'
