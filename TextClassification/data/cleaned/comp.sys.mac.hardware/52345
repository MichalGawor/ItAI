b'' b'hello' b'i recently accelerated my mac plus (micromac 25mhz accelerator)' b"and now i can't get my mac to boot off of the hard disk. it boots fine" b'from a floppy, and i can mount the hard disk using scsi probe, but i' b'cannot get it to boot from the hard drive. i installed a new driver, so i' b"don't think that is the problem." b'this poses a rather large problem. i only have meg of ram, and' b'i need to run mathematica, which requires meg. i was hoping to use' b"system virtual memory so that i could run mathematica. however, i can't" b"run system from a floppy, so i can't get enough ram." b'any suggestions? thanks for your time--'
