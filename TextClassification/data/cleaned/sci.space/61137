b'' b'' b'| on april a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to' b'| hours, its planned value during this mission phase.' b'' b"this activity is regularly reported in ron's interesting posts. could" b'someone explain what the command loss timer is?' b'' b'the command loss timer is a timer that does just what its name says;' b'it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving' b'commands. upon expiration of the command loss timer, i believe the' b"probe starts a 'search for earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing" b'and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish' b'communications. no-ops are sent periodically through those periods' b'when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows' b"that we haven't forgotten about it." b'' b"hope that's clear enough to be comprehensible." b'' b'--' b'"insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live' b'in the real world." mary shafer, nasa ames dryden' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
