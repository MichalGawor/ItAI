b'' b'hi,' b'' b"i've got an older motherboard (old as in, uses a b'keyboard controller, and uses memory interleaving rather than caching).' b'it has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause' b'the machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in b'enhanced mode. this occurs in norton desktop, file manager, and when' b'trying to install software. running win in standard mode works fine.' b'' b'has anyone run into this? any ideas? much thanks appreciated.' b'' b'david' b'' b''
