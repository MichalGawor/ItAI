b'' b"i was watching peter gammons on espn last night, and he's got me a little" b'confused.' b'' b'while talking about expansion, he started mentioning people who might benefit' b"from the fringe players they'll be facing: mcgriff hitting home runs," b"sheffield getting rbi's, and glavine winning games. this was," b'of course, all in reference to what happened the *other* times that baseball' b"has expanded (early 60's, late 60's, late 70's)." b'' b'what really confused me, though, was the mention of *al* players who would' b'do well next year. specifically, roger clemens winning games, and the' b'likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting home runs.' b'' b'my question is: how in the hell will the rockies/marlins help the al? the' b"last time i looked, there wasn't a lot of talent jumping leagues. did i" b'miss something?' b'' b'dennis cleary' b'' b'' b'i wondered the same thing. when he first mentioned it, i thought he was' b'just making a mistake but then he said it over and over. and then in the' b'examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even' b'when only one league expanded.' b'' b'so (since stats *never* lie i guess there is an effect on both leagues' b'because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making' b'every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up' b'players that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.' b'' b'make sense?'
