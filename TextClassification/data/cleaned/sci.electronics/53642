b'' b'' b"i'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need direct" b'input boxes for the keyboards. these are the little boxes that take a' b'line level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-z for the run' b"to the mixer. sadly they cost like (or more) each and i'm going" b'to need like or of them! i looked inside one (belonging to' b'another band) and it looks like just a transformer. does anyone have' b'any plans for building them?' b'' b"$50 each!! don't bother trying to make one yourself, just shop around a" b"little. i've found dod brand di boxes for as cheap as each. you can" b"get higher end ones for more, but for pa use for bands, i wouldn't bother." b'making one yourself might work, but getting a sturdy enough enclosure might' b"be hard (they're made of heavy guage metal, since they're always on the floor," b'being kicked around a lot). for any additional questions on this topic, you' b'might want to post to rec.audio.pro' b'lukas zahas'
