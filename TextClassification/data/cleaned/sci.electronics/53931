b'' b'' b'i was just wondering one thing, actually two. i hope that this is the' b'proper place to post this subject)' b'' b'why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)' b'when stored on a concrete floor?' b'i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle' b'from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and i just' b'went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but' b'they act like the two terminals are shorted. i asked a friend' b"and he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them," b"but he couldn't tell me why." b'' b'thanks'
