b'' b'can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make' b'absolutely no sense? (at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way' b'to my door.) i must have stared at "cleman" in the mets\' box for a' b"good seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was. wouldn't" b'it make more sense to use "colemn"?' b'' b'i\'ve seen it as "colmn" also.' b'' b'blame the associated press. after the official scorer balances the' b'official score card, they copy it and give it to several diffent people.' b'one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up (using a' b'template on a laptop) and transmit it to the ap offices in new york' b'(rockefeller center) via the telephone. the box scores are not checked' b"and just rebroadcasted over ap's news delivery services. if there are" b'corrections, those are issued later. it is the person sitting in front' b'of a laptop at shea (or whereever) whose fault that is. [note: the ap' b'puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in' b'most newspapers being the first one]' b'' b'last week they were in denver. maybe the ap person in denver did this' b"(remember, they just started with mlb out there). check tomorrow's" b'paper and see if the person who is doing it from shea does the' b'same thing.' b'--' b'scott barman mets mailing list (feed the following into your shell):' b'| subscribe' b"let's go mets!
