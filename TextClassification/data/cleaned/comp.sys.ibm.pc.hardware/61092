b'' b": what tube does the viewsonic use? does is support 1600x1280? i've been" b': looking a a philips 1762dt which uses a sony trinitron tube, has digital' b': controls, supports up to 1280x1024ni, and has .25mm dot pitch it can be' b': found for under b'' b': the original poster, john navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on' b': a sparcstation lx. the lx is able to generate a picture at at' b': hz. not officially, but i tried to set this resolution and refresh rate' b": and the lx came up with a non-syncing screen. our tube obviously couldn't" b': handle this speed. at hz, it worked perfectly.' b'' b"i don't know which tube the viewsonic uses, but it has an 82khz horizontal" b'bandwidth so you can go pretty high. i ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which was as' b'fast as the orchid p9000 could drive it. also, the does claim to be able' b'to support 1600x1280, but i have no experience with that.' b'' b"since i have the spec sheet in front of me i'll type some in:" b'' b'crt:\t17", mm dot pitch, deg deflection, rgb mediou short' b'persisance, tint (tm=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflection' b'' b'input signal: rgb analog 0.7vp-p, ohms (also has setting for 1vp-p)' b'sync: h/v separate(ttl), composite sync on green b'horizontal freq: 30-82khz, vertical freq: 50-90hz' b'compatibility: pc from vga to 1600x1280 non-interlaced, mac iici and above' b'controls: contrast, brightness, position, size, degauss, p-p voltage, color' b'temp, sync select, color tuning, moire on/off.' b'video band witdth: mhz' b'max brightness: cd/m2 at white flat field' b'misconvergence: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner' b'dimensions: 16.3"x16.22"x17.64", weight lbs' b'' b"i don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, i just" b"typed them in. other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple" b"dynamic astigmatism focus'. right. they mean they use two lenses. advanced" b'invar shadow mask. viewmatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use' b'system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output. as near as i have' b'been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,' b'and blue. how this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me.' b'' b'but beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at. sharp, clear,' b"and isn't nearly as bad as the nec's for reflections." b'' b'geoff sherwood'
