b'' b'==== begin repost b'' b'ibm, apple, motorola ready to unwrap powerpc processor' b'' b'' b'the wraps will come off the powerpc processor this week, as motorola' b'corp., ibm, and apple computer inc. detail the results of their yearlong' b'effort. this first in a series of powerpc processors will be a 32-bit' b"processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like intel corp.'s" b'pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions' b'per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. motorola' b'is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two' b'configurations, running at and mhz with performance of and b'specint89 marks, respectively, sources said. floating-point performance' b'for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their specfp89' b'performance will be and respectively. the a scaled-down' b'version of the power chip developed by ibm for its rs/6000' b'workstations, will also include a 32k single buffered cache on the chip' b"with protocols to support motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor bus" b'built in. the chip, which is being designed initially to support the' b'micro channel architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop' b'powerpc- based systems using a number of different architectures,' b"including isa, eisa, or sun microsystems inc.'s s-bus design, one source" b'noted.' b'' b'according to sources familiar with the development effort, motorola has' b'been extremely successful in developing the powerpc as an inexpensive' b'architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than million' b'transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. initial chips are expected to' b"be priced from to only slightly higher than intel corp.'s" b'486 processors but could be sold profitably for less than one' b'source said.' b'' b'==== end repost
