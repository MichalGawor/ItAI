b'' b'' b'' b'somebody mentioned a re-boost of hst during this mission, meaning' b'that weight is a very tight margin on this mission.' b'' b'how will said re-boost be done?' b'' b'grapple, hst, stow it in cargo bay, do oms burn to high altitude,' b'' b'unstow hst, repair gyros, costar install, fix solar arrays,' b'' b'then return to earth?' b'' b'my guess is why bother with usingthe shuttle to reboost?' b'' b'why not grapple, do all said fixes, bolt a small liquid fueled' b'thruster module to hst, then let it make the re-boost. it has to be' b'cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug. that way, now that' b'they are going to need at least spacewalks, then they can carry' b'an edo pallet, and sit on station and even maybe do the solar array' b'tilt motor fix.' b'' b'pat'
