b'' b'' b'chicogo is what i want to use. it is, like nt, a true os with thrue' b'multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,' b"and does not meet dod security specs (but that's okay since it will probably" b'be more of a client os). there are a few otehr differences, but those are the' b'main ones. there was an article about chicogo in pc week last august.' b'\tthe chicogo and nt development groups at micro$oft are in intense' b'competition, so it is said. however, i think a different relationship will' b'arise: nt will be the server (*n*etowrk *t*echonology), chicogo will be the' b"client machine. it is entirely possible for different os's to work together," b'partly because chicogo is just a small nt (think of it that way, anyway).' b"(novell netware creates an os on the server that is truly not dos, so don't" b'scorn the concept.)' b"\tanyway, don't expect it soon. windows and dos are supposed to be" b"released next year (read: see it in so i expect that chicogo won't be out" b"til b'how does chicago differ from the (sort of) announced windows my understand-' b"ing, at least from the inbfoworld accound of windows is that it's sort" b'of nt lite--a full-fledged operating system but lacking server and security' b'features that make nt such a bear. is w4 not true multithreading?'
