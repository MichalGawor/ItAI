b'' b'misinterpretation, though it should be a crime in itself, is what' b'united states lawyers use to make their bread and butter.' b'' b'in manchester, ct a few years ago, a small company wanted to run a' b'game system galled "lasergames," similar in many aspects to photon' b'(tm). three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law' b"in manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to" b'prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival' b'which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. among these' b'things was "shooting galleries," which is what the lawyers for the' b'opposition to lasergames wanted to harp upon. the judge took the two' b'words from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that' b'lasergames could not operate in manchester.' b'' b'keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in' b'their shooting galleries, and not light beams. clearly from context,' b'lasergames got shafted, but if the two words are applied, their denial' b'of operating permission was justified.' b'' b"if i had the text of the law i'd post it, but i'm afraid i don't" b'remember it all well enough to even try. that little bit with the two' b'words stuck well, though.' b'' b':\tjohn dormer' b''
