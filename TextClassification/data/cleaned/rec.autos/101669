b'' b'' b"quad reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable," b'then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect' b' (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter balance shafts.the acura has the engine' b' wins the reliablity contest hands down. you can rev that car all day, everyday,' b"and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (i speak" b'from expierence!)' b"i'm not saying the quad is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you" b'comparing it to a acura engine. and while the integra costs alot more, it is a' b'' b"a couple of things: blowing a hose doesn't speak of engine reliability, and" b"while it is true that quad4's have a problem with head gasket leaks, that was" b'a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected. also i know pontiac is' b'replacing head gaskets that leak for free for 6year/60k miles. other than' b'that i have found my quad4 to be completely solid and the direct ignition' b'system means no wires/rotor/rotor-cap to ever deal with. also hydrolic lifters' b"mean no valve adjustments ever. i'm not badmouthing the integra engine, i just" b'think you are going overboard on slamming the quad4. you are quite correct' b'that the integra engine is quieter, although i would not say smoother, my' b'quad4 loves to rev, especially at the high-end. do you have any evidence' b'of blocks cracking on quad4s? i have not heard of this.'
