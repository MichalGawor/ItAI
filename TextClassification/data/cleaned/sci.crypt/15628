b'' b'actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their' b'"product" the manufacturer (actually better yet, some "trusted" pair' b'of escrow agencies) has to have the key.' b'' b'most of us already are in this situation--our car makers have keys to our' b'cars (or can get them quickly from the vin number), and i have no doubt' b"that if presented with a court order, they'd surrender copies to the" b'government.' b'' b'chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks' b"they've installed, and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also" b'provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.' b'' b'of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash' b'and installing it yourself. even modifying the core to match some' b'arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. i once knew someone who' b'had fixed his locks in this way his house, office and cars all took' b'the same key (which he took good care of b'' b'the state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they' b'have a court order.' b'' b'bad analogy.' b'' b'very bad (yours, that is). have you ever had a safety deposit box?' b'they work on a two-key system. the bank clerk has one, and you have' b'the other (they are different keys). the bank does not keep a copy of' b'your key. if you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace' b'the door. this is a time consuming and expensive process (which they' b'will be happy to charge to your account b'' b'this process is exactly analogous to having a private key which' b'is not in a escrow system, and the state having to crack your cipher' b'to get the data.' b'' b'please do not use false analogies.' b'' b'peter trei' b''
