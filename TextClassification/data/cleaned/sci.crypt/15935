b'' b'something that no one has discussed yet (or i missed it):' b'' b'the fbi sets up a wiretap after the court order was handed.' b'only at this point they can access the line and detect' b'the serial number n.' b'' b'what happens next, does the fbi simply asks for the keys' b'for n, and, since a warrant was issued for the line, the fbi' b'simply gets it? what if multiple phones are used from the' b'same house, the fbi just asks for n1, n2, etc.?' b'' b'exactly who is to prevent the fbi from claiming some' b'other serial number, x, was also used over the wirtapped' b'line and get the keys for x?' b'' b'either a second court order (for the specific serial/key)' b'is required (and i have seen no indication of this), or' b'the fbi can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any' b'time, so the escrow key holders are a total fake.' b'' b'' b'two safeguards:' b'' b'1. the fbi could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the escrow' b'agencies, and associate it with a particular court order;' b'' b'2. if the thing comes to trial the defense attorneys can probe this issue' b'closely. it is not too different from proving that the speaker on a legal' b'wiretap is the person the court order covered.' b'' b'putting it another way, this question is not very different from the' b'pre-clipper question "what\'s to prevent the fbi from getting a court order' b'to tap al capone and then using it to tap jonathan livingstone seagull' b'instead?"' b'' b'david' b'--' b'david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of' b'our information, errors and omissions excepted.' b'' b''
