b'' b'' b'' b'for a project of my own, i would like to build a infra-red remote control' b'receiver (for regular vcrs and tvs remotes). does anybody have any info' b'or tips on how to build such receiver b'in particular,' b'a) which photo detector should i use (which wavelength do remotes use) b'b) which ics or circuit should i use b'c) any suggestions for circuit layout' b'' b'please reply to this group (if you wish), but as well via e-mail (my' b'link to usenet is not always available).' b'' b"i'd like to see this info as well. as for wavelength, i think" b"you're primarily going to find two nm a bit, and/or nm" b'+/- a bit. usually it is about nm either way. the two most common' b'i have seen were and but i have also heard of and b"i'm not sure that the nm one way or another will make a great deal of" b'difference.' b'' b'another suggestion find a brand of tv that uses an ir remote,' b'and go look at the sams photofact for it. you can often find some very' b'detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the' b'transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding' b'specs. if the system uses that.' b'' b'duane' b''
