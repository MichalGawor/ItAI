b'' b'' b'' b'"jesus only" and "oneness" tend to refer to groups that do deny the' b'trinity. b'they explain matthew by saying that jesus is the name of the father, jesus' b'is the name of the son, and jesus is the name of the name of the holy' b'spirit, father, son, holy spirit referring to different roles, all' b'filled by jesus. b'' b'imho this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough.' b'' b'i do not like a god who prays to himself. i refuse to believe jesus prayed' b"to himself let's get real, if the scriptures say he prayed to the" b'father, then the father is someone different than the son. i have no' b'problems with multiple gods. to me, the whole context of the scriptures' b'says: be perfect, even as your father who is in heaven; that we can be' b'co-heirs with christ; that we will be like him.' b'' b'co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.' b'when i am like him (christ), i will be the same as he is--and he is a god.' b'' b'if god cannot do this, the his is not all powerful--and he is not god.' b'if he will not, he is a liar--and he is not god.' b'' b'but if he does, he is the greatest of all the gods.' b'' b'' b"[i don't know of anyone who says that jesus prayed to himself. the" b"whole point of the trinity is that there's enough of a distinction" b'within god that relationship is possible. this implies some sort of' b'communication. i assume that in their "native" form, the father and' b"son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't" b'involved. but jesus is the incarnation of the son, i.e. the logos' b"made flesh. when he's in a human form, his human actions are limited" b'to human capabilities. so communication with the father takes the' b"form of prayer. i don't see that there's anything problematical about" b'that. it seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation.' b'--clh]'
