b'' b'it is all so changed by now. but in case any of you is' b'interested in what i actually said, i never compared the' b'israeli treatment of the palestinians with the holocaust.' b'anyway that is the truth if it matters. i was about to forget' b'about it myself since everyone started calling me anti-semitic' b'for making the comparison that i never made. what i did say was' b"that the nazis didn't start with the holocaust and their" b'initial actions were similar to what the israelis are doing now.' b'the jews that were stranded on the polish border since' b'no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the' b'lebenese border. no trials, no hearing, just expulsion based on' b'guilt due to race.'
