b'' b'' b'i am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from' b'a mc146818a real time clock. has anyone out there had some experience' b'in doing this? the specs call for a few sequences to be met before' b'standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but' b'i thought that i had it worked out. however, with a 32khz crystal the' b'lowest current drain i can acheive at 3.7v vcc is 150ua. this is' b'three times the specified maximum under the conditions i am attempting' b'to create.' b'' b'i have done the following things:' b'' b'1) made sure that reset/ is asserted for trlh after powerup, and as is' b'low during this time.' b'' b'' b'2) made sure that there is a cycle on as after the negation of rd/ or' b'wr/ during which stby/ was asserted.' b'' b'what am i doing wrong?' b'' b'thanks very much,' b'' b'martin.'
