b'' b'' b'you could just as well use a character password to perform the encryption' b'of the zero bits. one simple method would be to use the first characters' b'to encrypt the zero bits and then use the remaining characters to' b'encrypt the result again. the output would still be bits which encodes' b'into ascii characters.' b'' b'wouldn\'t this method be vulnerable against a "birthday" attack?' b'currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ key that produces' b'the given ciphertext. he has to try about keys on the average.' b'in the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves.' b'if he can store about guesses for one half, he is likely to find' b'a mathching pair in about guesses.
