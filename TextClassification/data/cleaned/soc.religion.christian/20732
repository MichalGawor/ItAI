b'' b'tim asks:' b'' b'i have stated before that i do not consider myself an atheist, but' b'definitely do not believe in the christian god. the recent discussion' b'about atheists and hell, combined with a post to another group (to the' b"effect of 'you will all go to hell') has me interested in the consensus" b'as to how a god might judge men. as a catholic, i was told that a jew,' b'buddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not' b'believe this. even more see atheists and pagans (i assume i would be' b'lumped into this category) to be hellbound. i know you believe only' b'god can judge, and i do not ask you to, just for your opinions.' b'' b'this is probably too simplistic for some, but john saus,' b'"for god so loved the world that he gave his only son, that' b'whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life".' b'' b'genesis "and he (abram) believed the lord; and he reckoned' b'it to him as righteousness".' b'' b"i don't find anywhere that god restricts heaven to particular" b'ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category' b'that we humans like to drop people into. but he does require' b'that we believe and trust him. in hebrews it says that god spoke' b'of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days' b'he has spoken to us by his son jesus christ. and we learn of' b'him through the pages of the new testament. the bible tells us' b'what we need to believe. for those who have never heard, i leave' b"them in god's capable care, he will make himself known as he" b'desires. it behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge' b'we have. if you reject the claims of jesus, and still go to' b"heaven, then the joke's on me. if you reject him and go to hell," b"that's no joke, but it will be final." b'' b'' b'gerry' b'' b'============================' b'the opinions expressed' b'are not necessarily those' b'of my employer.' b'============================'
