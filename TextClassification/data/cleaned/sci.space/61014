b'' b'why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts. for' b'example, why couldn\'t magellan just be told to go into a "safe"' b'mode and stay bobbing about venus in a low-power-use mode and if' b'maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy' b'gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.' b'' b"one consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now," b"you may not be able to later. this isn't a case of reaching over and" b'flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly' b'to execute a "turn off" command successfully. spacecraft do malfunction' b'in their old age. the big concern is not radio clutter from idle' b'spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can' b'no longer be turned off.' b'--'
