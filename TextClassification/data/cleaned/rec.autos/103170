b'' b'' b'' b'dont get me wrong, i love to drive in the left lane fast but when i overtake' b'cars who are on the right, i slow down a tad bit. if i were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, i would be the stupid one.' b'' b'just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one? it seems' b'to me, everybody should be aware enough of what is going on. you do not need' b'' b'i couldnt agree more. that is how it should work. people should also always see motorcycles too.' b'' b'i constantly scan behind me (i have one of those wink mirrors) and two outside mirrors. i actually spend just as much time checking my six (cops you know).' b'' b'i still get caught off guard every now and then.' b'' b'' b'maybe i didnt word it right the first time. what i was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very high speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you, you are stupid (of course, it depends on the circumstances). i have had some very scary instances when i assumed this and i dont think all of the fault was the other guy (now if he was going in a thats a whole different story)' b'' b'ok. i can agree to this, because, as we have both proved, what is ideally' b"supposed to happen, isn't always. and even though i'm rearely the one doing" b"the passing, i don't see where it makes you stupid, but i agree, that if you" b'think you are safe, because the other guy is supposed to have been paying' b'attention, then yes, you are just as dumb as the other(maybe dumber?)' b'hasta' b'drew'
