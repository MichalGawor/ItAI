b'' b'i have a gateway2000 local bus system. it has slots for simms' b'that either have to use or 16mb simms. my question: i just' b'received a 4x9 70ns simm and it has pins. the slot on the' b'motherboard has at least or so pins. did i get the wrong simm' b'or can i still use my simm although not all the pins on the slot would' b'be flilled. i have never encountered such a long slot for simms before.' b"anyone have suggestions? i can't get a hold of gateway yet. thanks" b'' b'yes, you bought the wrong simms.....you need 1x36 or 4x36, which are pin' b'simms.....these are better anyway becuase the send/receive data in 4byte' b'(32bit+4bit parity, one for each byte) chunks. you will undoubtedly see these' b'simms becoming more widely used in the near future.' b'' b'jason' b'--' b'' b'' b'****************************' b'* jason walters b'* a.k.a. modem mouth
