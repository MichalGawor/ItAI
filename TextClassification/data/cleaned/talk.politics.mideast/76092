b'' b'' b'| \ttell me, do these young men also attack syrian troops?' b'' b'in the south lebanon area, only israeli (and sla) and lebanese troops' b'are present.' b'syrian troops are deployed north of the awali river. between the' b'awali river and the "security zone" only lebanese troops are stationed.' b'' b'|' b'| with the blood of its soldiers. if israel is interested in peace,' b'| than it should withdraw from our land.' b'|' b'| \tthere must be a guarantee of peace before this happens. it' b'| seems that many of these lebanese youth are unable to restrain' b'| themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions' b'| prolong israels stay in south lebanon.' b'' b'that is your opinion and the opinion of the israeli government.' b'i agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but i am addressing' b'the problem as it stands now. hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement' b'will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for' b'both sides. my proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties' b'in the interim period. in my opinion, if israel withdraws' b'unilaterally it would still be better off than staying.' b"the israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing" b'to do such a move. i hope to be be able to change your opinion' b"and theirs, that's why i post to tpm." b'' b'| \tif the lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then' b'| israel would not have to be there. until it is, israel prefers that' b'| its soldiers die rather than its children.' b'' b'as i explained, i contend that if israel does withdraw unilaterally' b'i believe no attacks would ensue against northern israel. i also' b'explained why i believe that to be the case. my suggestion' b'is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides.' b'it is unfortunate that israel does not agree with my opinion.' b'' b'' b'|' b'| if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw' b'| unilaterally from the so-called "security zone" before the conclusion' b'| of the peace talks. such a move would save israeli lives,' b"| advance peace efforts, give israel a great moral lift, better israel's" b'| public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations' b'| since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in' b'| peace and has already offered some important concessions.' b'|' b'| \tisrael should withdraw from lebanon when a peace treaty is' b'| signed. not a day before. withdraw because of casualties would tell' b'| the lebanese people that all they need to do to push israel around is' b'| kill a few soldiers. its not gonna happen.' b'' b'' b'that is too bad.' b'' b'| along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah' b'| be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not' b'| accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a' b'| shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone' b'| and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it.' b'|' b'|' b'| \twhy should israel not demand this while holding the buffer' b'| zone? it seems to me that the better bargaining position is while' b'| holding your neighbors land.' b'' b'because israel is not occupying the "security zone" free of charge.' b'it is paying the price for that. once israel withdraws it may have' b'lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save' b"some soldiers' lives, that is my contention." b'' b'if lebanon were willing to agree to' b'| those conditions, israel would quite probably have left already.' b"| unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the lebanese can disarm the" b'| hizbolah, and maintain the peace.' b'' b'that is completely untrue. hizbollah is now a minor force in lebanese' b"politics. the real heavy weights are syria's allies. the gov't is" b'supported by syria. the lebanese army is over troops and' b'unified like never before. hizbollah can have no moral justification' b'in attacking israel proper, especially after israeli withdrawal.' b'that would draw the ire of the lebanese the syrian and the' b"israeli gov'ts. if israel does withdraw and such an act" b'(hizbolllah attacking israel) would be akin to political and moral' b'suicide.' b'' b'basil' b'' b'| adam' b'|' b'| "if we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we sure' b'| wouldn\'t waste them on members of congress..." -john perry barlow'
