b'' b'' b'in 3d studio, is there any way to create refraction, diffraction etc b'' b'i want to simulate such things as glass lenses, bottles etc.' b'' b"there might be an ipas routine that does that,but i can'r be sure. another" b'way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the' b'image. then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection. it will' b"take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection, but that's" b'the only thing i can think of.'
