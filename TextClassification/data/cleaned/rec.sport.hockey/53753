b'' b'does anyone have the games espn will be airing this week??? hopefully the' b'detroit/toronto game tongiht. i though abc did a decent job by getting some' b'' b'f**king *no* hockey games televised nationally tonight! what the hell is' b'this??? why the hell is espn showing some stupid baseball game, when' b'baseball is not even three weeks into the season and hockey is in the' b'playoffs??? no, wait, i know the answer: but still! it really' b'pisses me off to no end. they better start putting some more f*cking' b'games on, or they will never make any money off of the deal that brought' b"hockey back to espn. aargh!!!! (not that i'd watch anyway, but hockey" b'needs all the publicity it can get)' b'' b'--' b" keith keller\t\t\t\tlet's go rangers!!!!!" b"\t\t\t\t\t\tlet's go quakers!!!!!" b'' b'\t "a cow is not a vegetarian dish." keith keller, b'' b"you obviously don't understand how tv scheduling works. espn had" b'prior contracts to baseball to show monday night games and had' b'contracted all the other bs shows well in advance. the nhl tv deal' b'was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this' b'one-plus year out. the nhl package was finished two weeks before the' b'season started). espn has shown tremendous commitment to the nhl by' b'squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last minnesota' b'game) and putting stanley cup games as backup to their baseball' b'telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last' b'night).' b'' b'but the bottom line is that espn cannot break contracts at will. they' b'must honor the previous deals they made. _does_ have something' b'to do with it, especially if you risk a lawsuit for breach of' b'contract with baseball.' b'' b"so relax. i'm happy. (i don't get sportschannel anyway)." b'' b''
