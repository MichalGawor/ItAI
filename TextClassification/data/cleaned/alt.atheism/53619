b'' b'ks this is the story of kent, the archetype finn, that lives in the' b'ks bay area, and tried to purchase thomas paine\'s "age of reason". this' b'ks man was driving around, to staceys, to books inc, to "well, cleanlighted' b'ks place", to daltons, to various other places.' b'' b'ks when he asked for this book, the well educated american book store' b'ks assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section,' b'ks or then they said that his book has not been published yet, but they' b'ks should receive the book soon. in some places the assistants bluntly' b"ks said that they don't know of such an author, or that he is not" b"ks a well known living author, so they don't keep copies of his books." b'' b'ks such is the life and times of america, years after the revolution.' b'' b"sigh, now i don't feel so bad. searching for a copy in bookstores has" b'been a habit of mine for at least two years now. i spend a *lot* of' b"time browsing through bookstores, new and and used, and i've not once" b'seen a copy. now, i know, all i do is pick up a phone and order the' b"darned thing, but come on, this is america and he's one of the founding" b'fathers. and no one carries his books? sure, you can find "common' b'sense" but i think that\'s because it\'s required reading for most' b'colleges.' b'' b'i did find one hole-in-the-wall bookstore where the owner said that they' b"usually carry one or two copies, but that they were currently out. i haven't" b"been back since so i don't know if he was telling the truth or not." b'' b'sigh...' b'' b'' b'--' b'ed mccreary ,__o' b'"if it were not for laughter, there would be no tao."
