b'' b': hi!' b': \ti will change my soon, and i read something about the ibm ps' b': value-point... anyone have one? the video card is really a bit card?' b': how much cost in u.s.?' b': \tand the last question... can the ps value point sx 25mhz' b': upgrade to a dx2 66mhz???' b':' b': \tthank you veeery much in advance!' b':' b': \talejandro cifuentes h.' b'' b'these questions can be answered by any dealer of ibm value points, but, i will' b'provide some unsolicited advice the most amusing kind of advice.' b'' b'today (tueday ibm is supposed to officially announce the introduction' b'of the vesa local bus value point systems. these systems still have on-board' b'video and disk which are far better than the prior value point systems, and' b'you get vesa local bus for (future?) upgrades. we are going to buy three of' b'them with monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will' b'immediately be upgraded to ultrastor 34f caching scsi disk controller and' b'either the ati gup or the viper graphics board.' b'' b'do not buy a 486sx sytem.' b'' b'my personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free. when' b'you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes. (i.e. they' b'get you coming and going). translated this means take infrequent but large' b'steps. you are far better off short term and long term if you avoid the sx' b'models and go straight to the dx or dx-2 models.' b'' b'gordon'
