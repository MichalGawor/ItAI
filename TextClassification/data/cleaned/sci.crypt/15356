b'' b'the cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter. i see no valid' b"reasons for keeping it secret, and as i hope i've shown above there" b"are a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad." b'' b'it just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret. if it were' b'published, one could then build physically identical clone versions' b'of the chip that would interoperate with official clipper chips. but' b"the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow houses. hmmn." b'' b"or is there a technical hack that i've missed? e.g. how about if the" b'chips were made unprogrammed but serialized, and then shipped to the' b'two escrow houses who programmed in their halves of the keys, but' b'in a way that requires that secret keys known only to the escrow houses' b"be installed as well, without which clone versions wouldn't" b"interoperate? this is getting awfully complicated, but that's" b'crypto for you.' b'' b'--' b'john r. levine, iecc, pob cambridge ma b'"time is money! steal some today!"'
