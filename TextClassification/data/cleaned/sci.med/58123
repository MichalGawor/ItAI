b'' b'' b'' b'my biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like most' b"people with dizziness can be cured. that's definitely not the" b'case. in most cases, like i said above, it is a long, tedious' b'process that may or may not end up in a partial cure.' b'' b'' b'be sure to say "chronic" dizziness, not just dizziness. most' b'patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better.' b"the vertiginous spells of meniere's will also eventually go" b'away, however, the patient is left with a deaf ear.' b'' b'' b'to anyone suffering with vertigo, dizziness, or any variation' b'thereof, my best advice to you (as a fellow-sufferer) is this...' b"just keep searching...don't let the doctors tell you there's" b'nothing that can be done...do your own research...and let your' b'' b"this may have helped you, but i'm not sure it is good general" b'advice. the odds that you are going to find some miracle with' b'your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge' b'for this or any other disease are slim. when good answers to these' b'problems are found, it is usually in all the newspapers. until' b'then, spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical' b'problem may divert that energy from more productive things' b'in life. a limited amount should be spent to assure yourself' b'that your doctor gave you the correct story, but after it becomes' b'clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine' b'has no good solution, perhaps the best strategy is to join' b'the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to' b'make a career out of it.' b'' b'--' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'gordon banks n3jxp "skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
