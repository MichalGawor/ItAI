b'' b'' b'\twas the abc coverage of the kings/flames game supposed to be the' b'way it was shown in bc with cbc overriding the abc coverage? when i flipped' b'to abc, it was the same commentators, same commercials even. my question' b'is: was this the real abc coverage or did cbc just "black out" the' b'abc coverage for its own?' b'' b'' b"yes, it's called simulcast. in canada, when a canadian station and an" b'american station are showing the same thing whether a sporting event or' b'cheers on thursday night, the canadian signal is broadcast over the american' b'station. they even do this during the superbowl, which has the best commercials' b'of any television. what do we get here, dumb canadian commercials, the same' b"ones we've seen for that last year or so." b'' b"i'm in edmonton, and while that's usually (or at least often) the case," b'here we were "treated" to the actual abc telecast of the kings/flames' b"game. i'm with whoever said it earlier don witless (er, whitman) is" b'a poor commentator, and not just for hockey. normally, if the oilers' b'were still playing (augh), i would turn off the sound and listen to' b'the radio broadcast to get decent play-by-play announcing.' b'' b'bart, edmonton'
