b'' b'' b'i am in hte market for a new bike (been without for a few years).' b"the two main bikes i'm looking at seriously are" b'the yamaha virago and the honda shadow vlx b'i am leaning towards the yamaha for its shaft drive, the honda is chain.' b'insurance in fla. is more costly than i thought, so i am staying in this' b'power range. thanks in advance for any opinions and or experiences' b'' b"a friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new" b'yamaha virago after spending hours very late one chilly evening' b'watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen' b"the brake pedal, &c. &c.) i've pretty much decided never to get this" b'particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter' b'for me. compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his honda, this' b'is just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.' b'' b'' b'patricia'
