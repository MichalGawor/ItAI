b'' b'' b'i have a chance to buy a used ps/2 appletalk card to create a network with' b"my home machines. however, the guy who has the card tells me there's a" b"db-9 or db-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather than" b'the 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that i expect. this sounds more like a' b'thicknet ethernet card. should there be a transciever on it, like on the' b'quadras? what would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of' b"these cards, keeping in mind that it's micro-channel architecture, which" b'means take your best guess and double it.' b'thanks.' b'[richr]' b'--' b'the opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the university of' b'north carolina at chapel hill, the campus office for information' b'technology, or the experimental bulletin board service.' b'internet: launchpad.unc.edu or
