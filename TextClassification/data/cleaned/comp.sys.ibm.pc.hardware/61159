b'' b'' b'i have a headland technologies video seven vramii board that only' b'came with 512k, at the time this was ok but...' b'' b'i need info or help with upgrading this board to mbyte. there are' b'2 rows of pins over the vram chips, i think for a piggyback board' b'of vram. i would like to hear from anyone that may be able to help' b'me upgrade this board. maybe someone from headland who maybe read-' b'ing this has one of these piggyback boards just laying around, please' b'please please!' b'' b'does anyone know of where i could maybe buy the upgrade for this? i' b'would sure love to use this in 800x600-256 color mode but for the time' b'being, i can only get of the screen with the bottom part a white' b"strip, obviously because of the missing vram, actually i'm surprised" b'it even works to this degree at all!' b'' b'as a last resort, i will wind up selling this board and probably be' b'getting a mb-et4000 based "dumb frame buffer". this vramii was editors' b'choice in the pc mag. so if anyone has any info, please email' b'or as a last resort post to this group. thanks in advance.'
