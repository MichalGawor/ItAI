b'' b'' b'' b'|the word some sums it up, alot of scientist have concluded that without a' b'|doubt global climate will/is occur(ring) and should be dealt with by source' b'' b'without a doubt some warming will occur. however there is mucho disagreement' b'on how much warming will occur.' b'the original doomsdayers were claiming to degrees farhenheit. lately' b'they have been saying degrees. newer studies hint that it might be less' b'than a degree.' b'' b"of course, then there's the other side. an article in yesterday's atlanta" b'journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the' b'data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is' b'faulty. the point that the article made is that all long term temperature' b'dataa collected has been in urban areas, and that any heat rise can be' b'attributed to the growth and urbanization of the area. they called it' b'the "asphalt temperature trend". we have no real long term data on remote' b'areas, such as the middle of the amazon rain forest, or the top of mt. everest' b'or the gobi desert, for that matter. an accompanying article mentioned that' b'a group of scientists at nasa had developed a method for using a satellite' b'to collect temperature data globally, and that preliminary results showed' b'a slight downward trend attributed to the mt pinatubo eruption. it went' b'on to say that even with the current downward trend, there appeared to be' b'*no* change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at' b'least the next years.' b'' b'i can quote the article verbatim if you like..' b'--' b'tom gillman, systems programmer "aaaaagggghhhh"' b'wells computer center-ga. state univ. any "classic" star trek security' b"gsu doesn't care what i say on the internet, why should you?"
