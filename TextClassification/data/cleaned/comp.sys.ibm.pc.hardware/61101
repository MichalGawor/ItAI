b'' b'date: wed apr b'' b'' b'would someone be willing to explain to me the 486dx 50mhz is not more' b'popular than it is? i would think it would be just as fast, if not' b'faster than the 486dx 66mhz for certian applications. plus, a 50mhz' b'motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the' b'chip in the future. i must be missing something, since everyone is' b"buying the dx2 many adds don't even mention the dx b' thanks a lot,' b' -matt' b'' b'yes its realy simple, no one makes a mother board that runs the' b'bus at more than 33mhz....sam' b'--' b"this isn't quite true depending on the number of local bus slots, and" b'whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board, it is' b"possible to run local bus at up to and mhz. i've also spoken to a few" b'people who run standard local bus video cards at mhz without trouble' b"(and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed)." b'' b'-brian' b''
