b'' b'' b'' b" so what's the story here... we're all stuck with the regular" b"green, red, and off yellow-orange led's!? what gives!!??" b" anybody have a 'scoop' on fairly low priced blue< led's???" b'' b'' b'in order to emit blue light, a semiconductor must have a band gap energy' b'within the region of to electron volts. according to my physical' b"electronics prof, you can't get an led with that band gap. that's why you" b'' b"he's mistaken. they exist, the semiconductor is silicon carbide, and they" b'are inefficient and expensive. the bandgap is around ev.' b'' b"don't find blue leds or, for that matter, some other colour of leds. that" b"is not to say that blue leds can't be found. i've seen 'blue' leds sold," b'but they were just your typical visible light led in a blue plastic covering.' b"they didn't emit very much light..." b'' b'the ones i have are clear plastic. pray tell, what would make a "typical"' b'led emit blue light?' b'' b'' b'--'
