b'' b'\tmy problem with science is that often it allows us to' b'assume we know what is best for ourselves. god endowed us' b'with the ability to produce life through sexual relations,' b'' b'you assume this because you believe in a designing creator,' b'and you observe our ability to procreate...' b'' b'for example, but he did not make that availible to everyone.' b"does that mean that if science can over-ride god's decision" b'through alterations, that god wills for us to have the power' b'to decide who should and should not be able to have' b'children?' b'' b'.... but then you observe our ability to modify fertility' b'through intelligence experiment, and draw no similar conclusions' b'about god designing us for scientific inquiry the use of the' b'technology that it produces. how is it that one ability is "obviously' b'from god", and the other not?' b'' b'\ti cannot draw a solid line regarding where i' b'would approve of scientific study, and where i would not,' b'but i will say this: before one experiments with the' b'universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask' b'why they want this knowledge.' b'' b'i want to know the truth, and hold the truth as the most' b'basic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement' b'relies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. moralities that' b'assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not' b'compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon.' b'falsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows' b'corrupting both the intellect and the heart.' b'' b'i will say that each person should pray for guidance' b'when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and' b'should cease their unravelling if they have reason to' b'believe their search is displeasing to god.' b'' b'\t\t\t---malcusco' b'' b'if there is a god, he has nothing to fear from truth.' b'as to imaginary gods and there followers: be afraid. be very' b'afraid.' b'' b'max'
