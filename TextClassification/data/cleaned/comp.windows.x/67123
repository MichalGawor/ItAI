b'' b" hi, i'm new to this group so please bear with me!" b'' b' two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation' b" of raster files. with sunview becoming rapidly obselete, i've" b' finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview.' b" i put together a quick test, and i've found that xputimage()" b' is considerably slower (factor of on average?) than the' b' sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory' b' pixrects to a canvas. this was on a sparc ipx. it seems that:' b' the x protocol communication is slowing things down; or' b' xputimage is inefficient...or both! my question is, what' b' is the fastest way in x11r5 to dump plane image data to' b' a window? can i take advantage of the fact that the client is' b' running on the same machine as the server? or am i stuck with' b' xputimage() (in which case i might as well give up now...)?' b'' b' all help appreciated...thanks!' b'' b' derek' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------' b' derek c. richardson tel: x b' institute of astronomy fax: b' cambridge, u.k. b' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident ximages into' b'server resident pixmap(s) using xputimage. once this is done, the original ximages' b'can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using xcopyarea from the pixmaps to the windows drawable.' b'' b'hope this is helpfull.' b'' b'john' b''
