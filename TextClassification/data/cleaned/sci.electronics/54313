b'' b'' b" \ti'm trying to bring in bits to a pc, and would like" b' \tto use interrupt-driven routines. without buying an io' b' \tboard or making a new port, _where_ can i bring in these' b" \tbits? lpt seems to have only a few inputs, but i've heard" b' \trumours that some lpts have bidirectional lines. anybody' b' \tknow fer sure? if any bi-d lpts, which boards have them' b" \t(i'll be running a new 386dx-33)?" b'' b'' b"yes, it is possible. i'm making a stepper controller board," b'with digital inputs, and (up to) digital outputs from the port.' b'one main thing that will tell you whether the port is' b'bi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it. look for a chip' b"numbered 74ls245. if you don't have this, then it's probably a 74ls244," b'which will do you no good for reading in.' b'' b"now, if you do have the then do the following:" b'first, find the address of the port, (decimal) either or b'in pascal, you would "write(port[xxx]);" where xxx is the address in' b'either hex or decimal. the status lines, pins as well as the' b'strobe, pin are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address b'so for to read from status, then read from you can also output' b'to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines. in pascal,' b'do "port[xxx]:=value' b'".' b'' b'hope this helps.' b'let me know if you need more help.' b'' b'' b'_________________________________________________' b'inspiration b'seek the baden de bari b'unknown. b'-------------------------------------------------' b''
