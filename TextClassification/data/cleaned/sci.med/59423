b'' b': actually i am entering vet school next year, but the question is' b': relevant for med students too.' b'' b': memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.' b': since this is a major portion of medical education anatomy,' b': histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass' b': memorization i am a little concerned. as i am sure most' b': med students are.' b'' b': can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization? i' b': have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like' b': thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things. but i have' b': never applied them to large amounts of "data".' b'' b': has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or' b': cheap software?' b'' b': can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques? being an' b': older student who returned to school this year, organization (another' b': one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.' b'' b': please no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the material' b': conceptually. i have no problem with that, it is one of my strong' b": points. but you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is" b': rote memorization.' b'' b': thanks for your help.' b'the only suggestion i can think of off the top of my head is get a large' b'supply of index cards and memorize small amounts of info at a time, making' b'flash cards and quesitons. everytime i get a question wrong i always' b'manage to get the damn thing right the next time' b'' b'--' b'/\\ felix the cat' b'| the wonderful, wonderful cat!'
