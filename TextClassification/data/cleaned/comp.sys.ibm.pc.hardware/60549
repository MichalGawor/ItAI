b'' b'i have just a few quick questions. does anyone here have a dlc' b'system? (a cyrix dx) any problems with it?' b'second, how much should a cyric 486dlc-33 motherboard (with' b'no ram) run me?' b'3rd...should a total amatuer (like myslef) be able to perform' b'a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician, or is it' b'beyond hope?' b'4th...i hear that some (if not all) hard drives may require reformatting' b'if you switch them to another computer (or motherboard as the case may' b'be). is there any truth to this?' b'' b'any replies would be greatly appreciated.'
