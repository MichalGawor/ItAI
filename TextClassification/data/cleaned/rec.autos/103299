b'' b'' b'i just have got to remind all of you that this is it! yes,' b"that's right, somtime this fall, ford (the granddaddy of cars)" b'will be introducing an all-new, mega-cool' b"way-too-fast-for-accord-drivers mustang. it's supposed to be" b'100% streamlined, looking similar to the mach iii concept car' b"ford came out with around january. i can't wait. anyone out" b'there hear anything about it recently?' b'' b'if everything i\'ve read is correct, ford is doing nothing but "re-' b'skinning" the existing mustang, with minor suspension modifications.' b"and the pictures i've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job" b'of it.' b'the "new" mustang, is nothing but a re-cycle of a year old car.' b'' b'gee.... is it already?' b'yes, it will still be on the fox program chasis, anything that will be differe' b"nt on the new car as far as mechanical's is unknown. the suspension will most" b'likely be changed, as well as the drive drain. from what has been printed on' b'it, there is no clear idea of what will be done, as some say it will have' b'the modular v8 and others the current small block... just have to wait and see' b'also is far as styling goes from what i seen is good, a return to tradition.' b"c scoop on the sides and roof line much like a or fastback." b'' b"you know, i'm a ford fan, i must say, so i'm looking forward to the next" b'mustang. i have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable' b"than the camaro is now. you know, that's mho." b'' b'the differences these days between ford and gm are not so much the quality,' b'just the philosophy. it used to be quality _and_ philosophy. gm is' b'barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that' b'can only be made up in time. stss still come off the assembly line' b'with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;' b"it's those year old plants. and the latest gm products still come" b"with the standard equipment rattledash (tm). but like i said, they're" b'getting better and making the move in the right direction.' b'' b'they beat ford to the market with the camaro/firebird, but really only' b'in words. production of these vehicles will be limited until the' b'end of the year, keeping selling prices above msrp for the most part' b"since there are so many twitching camaro fans out there. i wouldn't" b'press ford to hurry the mustang since the final wait could be worth it.' b'besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the mustang anyway.' b'' b'i do not put much stock in the mag rags\' "inside" information, or even' b'ford rep quotes. the taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was' b'finally disclosed in it\'s entirety. "inside" information had the' b"taurus with a v8 and rear-wheel drive at one point. i wouldn't look" b'for a simple re-paneled mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself' b"if you do. there's a lot of potential. ford hasn't released a new" b'car without a 4-wheel is in years. the mustang project has been' b'brewing for at least right? a 4-wheel is could happen. those' b"modular v8's are out there, too. in the interest of cafe and" b"competition, don't rule those out, either. your ignorant if you do." b'and there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,' b"who really knows what it'll look like? the mach iii? doubt it." b'highly.' b'' b"the next mustang will be ford's highest profile car. it attracts" b"way more attention than the camaro/firebird because it's heritage" b"is more embedded in the general public. don't lie to yourself and" b'believe ford will forfeit that.' b'' b'i submit that the mustang will be a success. enough to elicit' b'defensive remarks from some heavy camaro fans here. you know,' b'intelligent, critical spews like, "the mustang bites, man!" some of' b'you are already beginning. i predict that the mustang and camaro' b'will be comparable performers, as usual. i predict that the' b'differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.' b'the camaro is still a huge automobile; the mustang will retain its' b'cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase. the camaro still' b'reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the mustang will appeal to' b'the driver. the camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while' b'the mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.' b'both will be more refined (i do think the camaro is). there will be' b'no clear winner.' b'' b"unless the ford gets the 32v, 300hp romeo. you don't seriously believe" b'that it was designed for the mark viii only, do you?' b'' b':^)' b'' b'regards,' b'' b'brian' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'i am the engineer, i can choose k.' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'department of engineering mechanics' b'ohio state university' b'columbus, oh'
