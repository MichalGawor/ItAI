b'' b' hi. i was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology' b' paper, and i read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the' b' tv screen at 1/200ths of a second. is that possible? i thought the' b' maximum rate the tv was even capable of displaying images was 1/30th' b' of a second. (or 1/60th of a second for an image composed of only odd' b' or even scan lines)' b'' b'you are correct; the fastest "complete" image that could be presented on' b'tv would be one field, which is of a second (approximately). of course,' b'the phrase "tv screen" is often thrown around in reference to any crt' b"display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal tv rates. might" b'even be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit' b"on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited)." b'' b'actually, a lot of this work used to be done with a crt that had a beamsplitter' b'mounted in front, and a tachistoscope driving it. the tachistoscope is really' b'just a slide projector with a very fast shutter. low tech, but it does the job.' b'--scott'
