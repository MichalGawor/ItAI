b'' b'' b'lebanese resistance forces detonated a bomb under an israeli occupation' b'patrol in lebanese territory two days ago. three soldiers were killed and' b'two wounded. in "retaliation", israeli and israeli-backed forces wounded' b'8 civilians by bombarding several lebanese villages. ironically, the israeli' b'government justifies its occupation in lebanon by claiming that it is' b'necessary to prevent such bombardments of israeli villages!!' b'' b'congratulations to the brave men of the lebanese resistance! with every' b'israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral' b"bankruptcy of israel's occupation and drawing attention to the israeli" b"government's policy of reckless disregard for civilian life." b'' b'' b'very nice. three people are murdered, and bradly is overjoyed. when i' b'hear about deaths in the middle east, be it jewish or arab deaths, i' b'feel sadness, and only hope that soon this all stops. apparently, my' b'view point is not acceptable to people like you bradly.' b'' b'hernlem, you disgust me.' b'' b'harry.'
