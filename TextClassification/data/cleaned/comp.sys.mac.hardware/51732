b'' b'anyone out there have a sony 1304s?' b'' b'i have one, and it\'s very nice, however if i run it in mode, the' b"picture won't" b'go very big. i end up with about gap either side, and top b'bottom. i suspect' b'an internal adjustment would fix this. anyone tried it?' b'' b'another problem is sub-brightness: areas that are meant to be black (or' b'off the main' b'raster) are not very black. the real raster is quite visible when the' b'screen is blanked.' b'this is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other trini screens' b'i have' b'used. if i turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not' b'visible, the' b'real image virtually disappears!' b'' b'the raster size is just right if i use but 100dpi+ is a bit too' b'much!' b'' b'oh, and i am using a rasterops 24xli card.' b'' b'' b'thanks' b'' b'marcus bointon' b'-------------------------------------------------------' b'marcus bointon tel b'"i used windows for a week once, but i feel better now"' b'-------------------------------------------------------'
