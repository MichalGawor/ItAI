b'' b'if re-boosting the hst by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it,' b"then why couldn't hst be brought back to earth and the repair job done" b'here?' b'' b'is it because two shuttle flights would be required, adding to the alredy' b'horrendous expense?' b'' b'' b"i don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing/launch" b'in terms of stresses/misalignments/etc. i would think of the reboost as' b'a gentile push, where a landing, then launch as two jolts which would' b'put more mechanical stress on the instruments. additionally, there might' b'be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden' b'landing. finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination' b'problems if the instruments came back to earth.' b'' b'of course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid' b"something that might be done in one shuttle launch. here's hoping" b"cepi's gang gets the job done right the first time." b'' b'(i used to work for frank cepollina)'
