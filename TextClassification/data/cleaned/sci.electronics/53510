b'' b' folks,' b'' b' here in the dallas area i have noticed that it is quite common to see an odd' b' "sensor" on top of traffic lights. these have been here for at least six' b" years. i've often wondered what they are." b' b' mike linnig, texas instruments inc. of all statistics are made b' b'here in erie, pa there is a system in the inner city called rado-lite (a' b'trade name) which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of' b'way by controlling traffic lights through radio signals. the receivers' b'look much like what you describe, but they include a uhf whip antenna (less' b'than a foot tall) and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that' b'an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching. local folklore' b"says this system was invented here; i don't know if this company has any" b'other installations. it has been in operation for at least years, going' b'only by my memory.' b'' b'bob sciamanda' b'edinboro univ of pa'
