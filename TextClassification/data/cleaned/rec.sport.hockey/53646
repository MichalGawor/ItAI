b'' b'' b"well, it's not that bad. but i am still pretty pissed of at the" b'local abc coverage. they cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing' b"david brinkley at instead of an earlier time slot. i don't" b'even understand their problem. if they didnt think enough people would' b'' b'not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? and' b'if they showed the remaining hours of the game, would it hurt to play' b'david brinkley at its regular time? they dont have any decent programming' b'before noon anyway. i called the sports dept and blasted them on their' b'machine. i called gain and someone picked it up. when i asked him why they' b'premepted the first half hour of the stanley cup playoffs, he seemed a bit' b"confused. when i explained a bit more in detail, he then said that's upto" b'to our programming dept. call back on monday. weel, i understand that the' b"sports dept is not responsible for this preemption. but i can't understand" b"how someone in the sports dept. can't even recognise the name of playoffs" b'shown on the very same station he works for.' b'' b'anyway, i am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again.' b'i urge all atlanta hockey fans to call wsb and ask them not to do the' b'same thing for the next weeks.' b'' b'-pravin ratnam(oh by the way, pens rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)'
