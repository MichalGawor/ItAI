b'' b'' b'homosexuals lie about the number to hide the disproportionate' b'involvement of homosexuals in child molestation. they also lie' b'about to keep politicians scared.' b'' b"1. you haven't shown any disproportionate involvement." b'' b'2. the janus report, which came out recently, gives as the percentage' b'of exclusively or predominantly gay men.' b'' b'i thumbed through the janus report in a bookstore recently looking' b'for a clue about their methodology. they were very unclear about' b'it, but as far as i could tell they relied on their professional' b'associates in the psychotherapy profession to provide the subjects,' b'interviews, and numbers. if so, this would hardly represent an' b'average cross-section. i posted to usenet at the time asking for' b'more data about their methodology but answer came there none. (i' b'must have been out of my mind for even asking for factual information' b'on usenet!)' b'' b'' b"3. no one is presumably going to say they're gay if they're not. but" b'some no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys. thus' b'the is a lower limit.' b'' b'this is the problem. people have to have a lot of confidence in' b'the anonymity of a study before they can counted on to speak' b"freely about stuff like that. but i agree that if someone's" b'going to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claiming' b'to be straight rather than the other way around.' b'' b'' b'i still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage' b'between and b'' b"i don't see why there's any more evidence for this figure than any" b'other. it seems totally arbitrary.' b'' b'' b'' b'---peter' b''
