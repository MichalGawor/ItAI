b'' b'to recapitulate a bit:' b'' b"- the essence of marriage is two people's commitment to each other." b'' b'- if two people claim to be married "in their hearts" but are not' b"willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state, that's" b"prima facie evidence that the commitment isn't really there." b'' b'- there are obvious situations in which christian marriage is possible' b"without a civil or church wedding: if you're stranded on a desert" b'island, or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason' b'(e.g., laws against interracial marriage).' b'' b'- the legal concept of "common-law marriage" is meant to ensure that' b'the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the' b'usual ceremony and record-keeping.' b'' b'- pastorally, i\'m concerned that people should not use "being married' b'in god\'s eyes" as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding.' b"one has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed." b'' b'- but there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony' b'without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married' b"in god's eyes. right?" b'--' b':- michael a. covington, associate research scientist b':- the university of georgia phone b':- athens, georgia u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi b'' b'[i think the last statement is dangerous. i believe as long as' b'someone has formally undertaken the responsibility of marriage, they' b'have a moral obligation, even if their intention was not right. other' b'people are involved in the marriage covenant. if they believed in' b'good faith that a marriage occurred, then i think there are' b'obligations created to them. of course there are situations where' b'intent can cause a marriage not to exist. the classic example is when' b"it's done as part of a play. but these are exceptions, and should be" b'clear to all parties. --clh]'
