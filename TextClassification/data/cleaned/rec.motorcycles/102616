suggestion. ask the kotl in e-mail. you'll" b'just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole' b"net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too." b'' b'by now you\'re probably asking "so who\'s the kotl already?". well, as' b'john sloan notes below, that\'s about the only real "secret" left around' b'here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. first, it is not myself,' b'nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe though john was' b'the original kotl. second, in keeping with the true spirit of unix, the' b"kotl's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely" b'with hexadecimal characters. the kotl shares his name with a line-' b'oriented text utility.) third, he has occasionally been seen posting' b'messages bestowing new dod numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weenie' b'mailers"). fourth, there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a' b'dead-head.' b'' b'***************** newsflash: a message from the kotl b'' b'once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically' b'groveled to the kotl, please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed' b'work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting' b'something done. your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)' b'days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two. during such times of' b"economic activity on the part of the kotl's employers, sending yet" b'another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it' b'just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an' b'excersize for the reader). if you suspect mailer problems, at least' b'annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request' b'was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think' b'the kotl *memorizes* the list?!?).' b'' b'***********************************************************************' b'' b"one more thing, the kotl says that its telepathic powers aren't what" b'they used to be. so provide some information for the list, will ya?' b'the typical dod list entry contains number, name, state/country, b'e-mail address. for example:' b'' b'' b'(ps: while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only' b"requirements for dod membership, that's not strictly true these days, as" b'there are a number of denizens who lack one or both.)' b'' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'"denizens of doom", by bruce tanner (dod b'' b"[road rider, august reprinted with bruce's permission]" b'' b'there is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal' b'things that a bunch of bikers do. they discuss motorcycles and' b'motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,' b'helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve' b'seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy,' b'traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double' b'entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship. they' b'argue with each other and plan rides together.' b'' b'the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that,' b'although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each' b'other face to face. the members of this group live all over the known world' b'and communicate with each other electronically via computer.' b'' b'the computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;' b'the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry' b'professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users. currently,' b'rec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it\'s the file name for' b'the group\'s primary on-line "meeting place") carries about articles per' b'month; it is read by an estimated people. most of the frequent' b'posters belong to a motorcycle club, the denizens of doom, usually referred' b'to as the dod.' b'' b'the dod started when motorcyclist john r. nickerson wrote a couple of' b'parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes. fellow computer' b'enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "denizen' b'of doom." a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr. keeper of' b'the flame. bruce was then designated dod nr. retroactively and, of' b'course, nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given dod nr. b'' b'the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules' b'appealed to many, so john sloan dod nr. became keeper of the' b'list, issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one. to date there have been' b'almost memberships issued to people all over the united states and' b'canada, as well as australia, new zealand, the united kingdom, france,' b'germany, norway and finland.' b'' b'keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch. the initial run' b'of patches sold out immediately. the profits from this went to the' b'american motorcycle heritage foundation. another amhf fund raiser b'selling denizens of doom pins to members was started by arnie skurow a' b'few months later. again, the project was successful and the profits were' b'donated to the foundation. so far, the denizens have contributed over b'to the ama museum. a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs' b'in the motorcycle heritage museum.' b'' b"as often as possible, the dod'ers crawl out from behind their crts and go" b'riding together. it turns out that the two largest concentrations of' b"dod'ers are centered near denver/boulder, colorado, and in california's" b'"silicon valley." consequently, two major events are the annual assault on' b'rollins pass in colorado, and the northern versus southern california' b'"joust."' b'' b'the ride-and-feed is a bike trip over rollins pass, followed by a big' b'barbecue dinner. the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern' b'california ride south; riders from southern california to ride north,' b'meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle. an additional plan' b'for is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction' b'with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus, ohio, in july.' b'' b"though it's a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective" b'communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional' b'motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in' b"search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to" b'get together. long may they flame.' b'' b'' b'"live to flame flame to live"\t[centerbar]' b'' b'this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which' b'you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do' b'anything like that face to face. these insults are known as "flames";' b'issuing them is called "flaming." flames often start when a member' b'disagrees with something another member has posted over the network. a' b'typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be' b'something like: "what an incredibly stupid statement, you spandex-clad' b'poseur!" this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense' b'of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding' b'ability and your cat.' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'_the denizens of doom: the saga unfolds_' b'' b'by john sloan dod b'' b'periodically the question "what is dod?" is raised. this is one of' b'those questions in the same class as "why is the sky blue?", "if there' b'is a god, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "why do' b"women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they" b'dump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,' b'and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion' b'by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the' b'halls of academe for generations.' b'' b'a long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few' b'minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on' b'a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two' b'machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another' b'via a system in chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but' b'who was eventually assigned the dod membership wrote a satire of' b'the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and' b'signed it "the denizen of doom". not wishing to identify himself, he' b'asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time' b'become dod to post it for him. dod not really giving a whit' b'about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking' b'individual, did so. flaming and other amusements followed.' b'' b'he who would become the holder of dod membership thought this was' b"the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty" b'easily amused), so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom' b'motorcycle club, and started signing his postings with his membership' b'number.' b'' b'perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a' b'motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or' b'make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized' b'electronically. it may well be that readers were yearning to become a' b'part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a' b'gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the' b"sum of its parts. it could also be that we're all computer nerds who" b'wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen' b'to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight' b'ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open' b'minded enough to accept us as members.' b'' b'in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, the denizens of doom' b'motorcycle club was born. a club in which the majority of members have' b'never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet' b'feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some' b'of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). a club organized' b'and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the' b'network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list' b'(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the' b'same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating' b'around the country (organized by dod club patches (organized by' b'#11), and even an mtv-style music video (produced by and' b'distributed on vhs by b'' b'where will it end? who knows? will the dod start sanctioning races,' b'placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine' b'management computers? will the dod organize poker runs where each' b'participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?' b'will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal' b'room and at least a 386-sized unix system? only time will tell.' b'' b'the dod has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net' b'access and a love for motorcycles. to become a member, one need only' b'ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few' b'really good club secrets). new members will receive via email a' b'membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which' b'includes name, state, and email address.' b'' b'the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever (or at least' b'until next year when we may decided to change the name).' b'' b'live to flame flame to live' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'the dod daemon as seen on the patches,

b'"that\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\'d have to kill you."' b'' b'and the rest is history.' b'' b'a variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation about' b'what dod

all started with ilana stern and chuck' b'rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. many copies were made,' b'and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in' b'unknown

but he has taken' b'the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.' b'' b'not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk' b'at their motorcycles. a

news is that" b"there's been an amazing variety of dod-labeled widgets created. the bad" b"news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. this isn't" b'because of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no' b'"dod store" that keeps a stock. all of the creations have been done by' b'individual denizens out of their own pockets. the typical procedure is' b'someone says "i\'m thinking of having a dod frammitz made, they\'ll cost' b'$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the ama museum. anyone want one?" then' b'orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to

[thanks to ed green for the above addition.]' b'' b'also worth mentioning are: the first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the' b'moab/canyonlands area of southern utah. riders from states showed up,' b'riding everything from monster bmws to itty-bitty xrs to almost-legal' b'2-strokes. and though it\'s not an "official" (as if anything could be' b'official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races' b'in steamboat springs, colorado always provides a good excuse for netters' b"to gather. there's also been the occasional labor day gather in utah." b'european denizens have staged some gathers too.
