b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b' \t lds and rlds' b' philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true' b' church as set down by jesus, but that god will judge each on his' b' own merits. in addition, the rlds also contend (and the lds may' b' as well) that ignorance of the true way (tm) is an excuse. you' b' can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected' b' it. in short, lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutherans to' b' buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they' b' will not be penalized for ignorance.' b'' b'' b'i believe that this is not quite correct. my understanding is that lds is' b'engaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of other' b'religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into' b'heaven. to this end, the church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so' b'that they will know the names of people to convert. a long article in the new' b'yorker a few years ago described the lds research methods in some detail (for' b'example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the' b'names of people long dead). this sounds like just the sort of lie that would be' b'made up about any unusual religion, but the new yorker story convinced me that' b'there is some truth to it (the new yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and' b'the story was quite detailed).' b'' b'ari' b'' b''
