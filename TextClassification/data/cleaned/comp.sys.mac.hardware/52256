b'' b'' b' hi-' b' do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture' b' apple uses in the powerbook duos? or in the powerbook in general?' b'' b' what are the factors that make the duo so slow compared to a desktop' b' machine running the same processor at the same speed (25mhz how many' b' wait states are in the memory system, etc? what kind of a data bus does it' b' use? 32-bit or 16-bit?' b'' b'' b'huh? where did you get this idea from? i think you got this' b"backwards. the duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop" b'machine by (and the rest of the powerboks). i think the' b'explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in instead of b'cycles i believe). things that could affect performance would be' b'factors such as use of functions enhanced in the fpu (which the duo' b"doesn't have undocked). extensions and background applications can" b'slow your computer down too. real life differences in speed are likely' b'to be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen' b'depth you are running etc.' b'' b'espen' b'' b'ps! the duo is 32-bit through-out.'
