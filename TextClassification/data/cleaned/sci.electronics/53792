b'' b'hi,' b'' b'being a electronic engineering student with only electronic ii under' b'my belt, i find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage audio amp. so,' b"i'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!" b'' b'please explain how watts are calculated in audio amp circuits. no,' b'not p=i*e, just how it relates to one of the following:' b'' b'ai [current gain]' b'av [voltage gain]' b'ap [power gain]' b'or whatever.' b'' b'i already have a ?wonderful? cheap i.e schematic for a 20w amp, but' b'i would like to cross/improve the circuit. the problem is that the parts' b'list has ic1 and ic2 as nec70001ab amplifiers. they look like pin?' b'sip packages with a heatsink. this schematic was published in a mag' b'so it may be non-existant now. anyway, i tried looking up a replacement in' b'the latest digi-key cat and found it not listed the closes i could' b'figure was a pin sip as tda1520bu. anyone got any ideas?' b'' b'i thought, hey i can rin a pspice simulation using opamp' b"models. yea, great! it worked. but, i guess the wasn't made for high" b'power amps. as a result, i got a voltage gain of ~15mv/v. worse than' b'i started with does anyone have a pspice ckt file with cheap yet' b'good gain? how about some models for some of the chips listed in this' b'e-mail? any ascii chip info you guys can send me?' b'' b"i'm open to suggestions/ideas/comments/help!" b'please e-mail since i have little time to search the news...' b"and i'll post if there's and interest!" b'john' b'' b'' b'--' b'____________ |||ibm ee majors do it best b'--------\\\\ |||atari |~~~~~~~~~john d. zitterkopf~~~~~~~~~~~~~'
