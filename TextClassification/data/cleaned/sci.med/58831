b'' b'=surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. one' b'=slightly off the subject case in point. my brother got stung by a bee. i know' b'=he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized' b'=swelling, not anaphylactic shock. i could not convince the doctors of that,' b"=however, because that's not written in their little rule book." b"of course, bee venom isn't a single chemical. could be your brother is" b'reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock' b'in other people.' b'' b'hmmm. the last time i got stung by a bee i experienced the same reaction' b"the first poster's brother did. we went off to the doctor to see if i" b"should worry about the fact that my foot was now about times it's normal" b"size. (and itched!!! ow!) he basically said i shouldn't this time, but" b'that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to,' b'but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that' b'next time could be the time i go into anaphylactic shock. admittedly this' b"was many years ago when i was young. since then i just make sure i don't" b"get stung. i also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but i don't." b'' b"this isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a" b'different reaction, just a different degree of reaction. allergies work' b'that way. people have various reactions. sort of like diabetes, some' b'people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor' b'their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet' b'like a hawk and use insulin regularly.' b'' b'i think msg is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to' b"it. some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy" b"sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't" b"necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone." b'' b'johanna'
