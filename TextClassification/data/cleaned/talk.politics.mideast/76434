b'' b'can someone elaborate a little on what this "libertarian" movement is? i' b'am not going to draw conclusions from a small sample, but so far i' b'recall two self-described "libertarians" posting here. both seems to be:' b'' b'1) incredibly ignorant.' b'2) incredibly arrogant.' b'3) all they want is to get people angry.' b'4) posses a lousy sense of humor.' b'5) write incoherently and jump from topic to topic without any logical' b' connection between topics.' b'6) describe themselves as intelligent and knowledgeable, although everything' b' in their posters points to the opposite.' b'7) very childish.' b'' b'the libertarians believe in getting the government off the' b'backs of the people, so that the free market can solve problems.' b'' b'libertarians believe in an end to the welfare state, an end to' b'government subsidies of all sorts. the basic idea is that the' b'government is way too big and way too expensive, and should be shrunk' b'down to a reasonable size.' b'' b'they also believe in a complete end to foreign aid, including' b'the stationing of american troops overseas. we can not and should not' b'be policing the world.' b'' b'' b'i agree that the people who come into this group and describe' b'themselves as libertarians seem to posses the charictaristics you' b"describe, but heck, we're not all like this. i'm a libertarian, and" b"i've got a great sense of humor! b'' b'adam' b'' b'' b'' b'"if we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we sure' b'wouldn\'t waste them on members of congress..." -john perry barlow'
