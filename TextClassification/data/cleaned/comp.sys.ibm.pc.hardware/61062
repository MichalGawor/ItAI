b'' b'' b'i am looking for information on how to install a floppy as drive' b'a:, a floppy as drive b:, a twisted cable (with the twist between' b'the two floppy connectors), and a controller. for example, should both' b'drives have drive select=1?' b'depends on the fdc but generally no. the drive at the end after the twist' b'should be set as drive b'what about the terminating resistor pack that\'s in the floppy?' b'which connector should go into which drive?' b"since you're using the as drive a: it should be at the end after the" b'twist with the resistor pack fitted.' b'does pin-0 on the connector always correspond with pin-0 on the floppy' b'drive?' b'yes' b' stuff deleted' b'' b'hope this helps. i had exactly the same problems. unfortunately when' b'i changed to different machine the problems started again because' b"of a different fdc. seems (don't flame me, this is mainly guess work" b"from practicle experience) that some fdc's do different things with the" b'select.' b'' b'john.' b'' b''
