b'' b'' b' did you know that jesus talked more' b' about hell than he did about heaven!' b'' b' thank you for this info. what respect i had for the man now' b' has been diminished tenfold. i promise never again to' b' say how wise or loving this man was...' b'' b'i have a hard time understanding this attitude.' b'' b'if the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little' b'doubt that jesus belived hell was a reality.' b'' b'as a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people' b'in your audience were headed there? to warn them! it would, however,' b'be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists' b'and then remain quiet about it.' b'' b'the only scenario i can envision in which dimished respect would be' b'justified is if jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke' b'about it anyway, just to scare people. unless you would accuse jesus' b'of this, i would encourage you to reconsider what a loving response' b'is when you perceive someone to be in danger.' b'' b'---' b'dave weaver "he is no fool who gives what' b'| cannot lose." jim elliot
