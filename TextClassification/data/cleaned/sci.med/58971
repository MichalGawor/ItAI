b'' b"i've been invited to spend a couple weeks this summer rafting down the" b'mississippi. my journey partners want to live off of river water and' b'catfish along the route. should i have any concerns about pollution or' b'health risks in doing this?' b'' b"you'd have to purify the river water first. i'm not sure how practical" b"that is with the mississippi. you'd better check with health agencies" b'along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river. if' b'it is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you' b'may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals.' b'better be same than sorry. obviously, drinking the river without' b'processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites.' b'--' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'gordon banks n3jxp "skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
