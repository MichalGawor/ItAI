b'' b' a person i know, belonging to a research lab of a rivate' b' company, claimed to me during a priavte conversation that, given the' b' equipment in his lab, he could crack a kerberos ticket in minutes to' b' an hour. he had access to rather powerful des hardware, but not of an' b' extraordinare kind, i believe. the attack was possible because of the' b' amount of known plaintext in the ticket, which itself constitutes a small' b' message. this was two years ago.' b' des is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data. for a' b' lot of purposes, however, it is still very adequate.' b'' b'this sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser, not a weakness in' b'des. merritt and i pointed out this weakness in kerberos in a paper' b'that came out about years ago, in both computer communications' b'review and usenix. for that matter, it was loudly discussed on the' b'kerberos mailing list even earlier.' b'' b'the problem has nothing whatsoever to do with des, and everything to do' b'with bad password selection.' b'' b"i'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks" b"possible on des. i'm quite dubious that private research labs know" b'them. and the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well' b'established; see, for example, the garon and outerbridge paper in the' b"july cryptologia. you're not going to do it in an hour with only" b"``rather powerful des hardware''. i'll leave the arithmetic as an" b"exercise for the reader. on average, you'll need to do trials." b'pick your own parameters for how fast the des engine runs, and for' b'how many such engines are used.'
