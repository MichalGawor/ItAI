b'' b'a fine year history came to a close tonight, as the minnesota north stars,' b"or norm's stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the red wings by a score of" b'5-3. the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen, who netted' b'two including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute to' b'play.' b'' b'' b"yes, it's a shame that the nhl lost a fine team in one of the best" b'hockey markets in the country. being a north stars fan, it is sad to' b'see all of the tradition of the last years get thrown into oblivion' b'at the hands of a truly crappy owner.' b'' b'hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin cities' b'within the next five years. even if this is the case, a lot has been' b'lost in the north stars move...' b'' b'kea'
