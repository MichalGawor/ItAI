b'' b'' b'hi,' b'recently, when i run the norton disk surface test, i realize a slow' b'down in harddisk accessing. at begining of the test, the harddisk will' b'be checked at the speed that usually is. as the surface test scaned' b'half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured. the' b'expected time for operation will jump from to minutes. i try to use' b'some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to' b'my harddisk and report always turn out to be none. the surface test' b'only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the' b'original speed after it gets over the section. i am wondering whether' b'it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. anyway help or comment' b'will be appriciate....' b'shane cheney wang'
