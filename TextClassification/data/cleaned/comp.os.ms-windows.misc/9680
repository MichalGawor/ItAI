b'' b'i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few' b'questions about windows for workgroups.' b'' b'i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with' b'windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. b'i am considering moving all our machines to w4wg.' b'' b'q1: how much conventional ram does w4wg use over and above the' b'driver for the network card?' b'' b'q2: if i have a novell ne2000 card, are the lsl and ipx drivers' b'still needed?' b'' b'q3: does w4wg do a license check over the network to ensure each' b'machine is running its own licenced copy of w4wg? (note: i do' b'not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy' b'of w4wg for each of our machines, it is just that i would like' b'to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. returning one' b'opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies.)' b'' b'q4: if you buy the upgrade to windows for w4wg does it replace' b'all of win as you install it or does it depend on current' b'win files?' b'' b'q5: if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out, will i have' b'any troubles with the w4wg machines?' b'' b'when i started this message, i was going to ask only questions but i got carried' b"away. i'll stop now b'' b'i look forward to your replies.' b'' b'al' b'' b'--' b'alan walford eos systems inc., vancouver,b.c., canada tel:
