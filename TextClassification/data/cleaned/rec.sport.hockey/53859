b'' b'well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little' b'easier for the playoffs. let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of' b'each other while chicago sweeps st.louis. that just makes it easier in' b'the second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det getting' b'none. for the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division' b'but that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the' b'hawks again. then bring pitt. and sure the hawks will probably lose but' b'its better to get that far and lose than to not go.' b'' b'brian' b'' b'' b'hopefully, a miracle (o.k. not quite a miracle, but close!) will occur and' b'pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals. if they make it again,' b"they will probably keep the cup. if they don't, it's the hawks' turn!" b'' b'go blackhawks!!' b'' b'congrats to jeremy roenick for being only the 2nd hawks player to post' b'back to back goal seasons!!' b'' b'scott' b''
