b'' b'' b': \ti was recently talking to a possible employer mine! and he made a reference to a' b': 48-bit graphics computer/image processing system. i seem to remember it being called image or' b": something akin to that. anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color a 12-bit alpha channel. that's" b": bits of info--what could that possibly be for? specifically the 48-bit color? that's b': trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve. is this an anti-aliasing thing? or' b': is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.' b'' b'' b"i'm pretty sure most industry strength image processing specific" b'systems (i.e. photo processing gear) use as much as bits of color info.' b'why? why not, oversampling is never a bad idea especially if the' b"hardware's only task is image manipulation, and profressional photographers" b'demand professional results.' b'' b": \talso, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are sgi's flagship products? i know of" b': iris, indigo, and crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line?' b': (sadly, i have access to none of them. just a dec sigh.)' b'' b"strange question, but anyway, there's the vgx line, the newer" b'indigo^2, and the onyx systems are the new big boys on the block (you' b'can get a processor system with twice the graphics performance of' b'a reality engine). there\'s more, but i don\'t have my handy "periodic' b'table of sgi\'s" on me...' b'' b'' b'keith' b''
