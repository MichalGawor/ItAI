b'' b'i recall a discussion i had heard years ago. it went something like this:' b'the problem with omnipotence (at least as i perceive it) as personified by' b'the christian god ideal is that it is potentially contradictory. if a' b'manifestation such as god is truly infinite in power can god place limits' b'upon itself?' b'.' b'.' b"some stuff i can't recall." b'then some other questions i think i recall correctly:' b'can god unmake itself?' b"can god make itself (assuming it doesn't yet exist)?" b'has god has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all of' b'gods potential quantum states into reality?' b'was god nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed during' b'the earliest stages of universal (inflationary?) creation?' b'is god a vacuum fluctuation?' b'given a great enough energy density could we re-create god?' b'would that make us god and god something else?' b'.' b'.' b"some more stuff i don't recall concerning creating god. followed by:" b'is god self-aware?' b'is it necessary that god be self-aware?' b'is god a living entity?' b'is it necessay that god be a living entity?' b'is god unchanging or does it evolve?' b'.' b'.' b'any comments? post them so that others might benefit from the open inquiry' b'and resulting discussion.' b'' b'kyle' b'' b'' b'' b''
