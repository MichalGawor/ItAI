b'' b'' b'' b' announce that a reward of billion would go to the first corporation' b' who successfully keeps at least person alive on the moon for a' b' year.' b'' b' and with $1b on offer, the problem of "keeping them alive" is highly' b' likely to involve more than just the lunar environment!' b'' b' "oh dear, my freighter just landed on the roof of acme\'s base and they' b' all died. how sad. gosh, that leaves us as the oldest residents."' b'' b' "quick boss, the slime from yoyodyne are back, and this time they\'ve' b' got a tank! man the guns!"' b'' b' one could imagine all sorts of technologies being developed in that' b' sort of environment.....' b'' b' greg.' b'' b" (i'm kidding, btw, although the problem of winner-takes-all prizes is" b' that it encourages all sorts of undesirable behaviour witness' b' military procurement programs. and $1b is probably far too small a' b' reward to encourage what would be a very expensive and high risk' b' proposition.)' b' b'' b'hey! my dad has an old hangar and judy has some old rockets in her attic,' b"let's put on a lunar program! sounds good, but b"let's play a game what would be a reasonable reward? what companies would" b'have a reasonable shot at pulling off such a feat? just where in the' b'budget would the reward come from? should there be a time limit? would a' b'straight cash money award be enough or should we throw in say b'exclusive mining rights for the first fifty years? you get the idea.' b'' b"i'd like to play but i don't have a clue to the answers." b'' b'tom freebairn he who refuses to understand math' b'| will probably never get his checkbook figured out.'
