b'' b'' b'i saw this posted and it brings an interesting event to mind b'' b'' b'' b'the reactions of little boys seems to be the most enthusiastic to' b'a wave (and also good to see). i always wave when i see a kid that' b'has at least noticed my bike. i figure it helps the future of the' b'sport.' b'' b'i have to admit that i usually try to do so without the "parental' b'figure" noticing i`m afraid that the kid will get yelled at for' b'associatign with anti-societal types like us.' b'' b'' b'a few weeks ago i was in the dmv with ken. i was standing in a mile long' b'line waiting for some really bored looking person to fleece a bunch of' b'people from some dough. ken was sitting on a chair next to our helmets' b'wondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of' b'people you would find at a laundromat when some young woman walked in who' b'required our conferring attentions. he came over and stood in line with me' b'while we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid' b'about years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets, one at a time.' b"i didn't particularly mind, and neither did ken (that the kid was touching" b"our helmets that is). but the helmets weren't on the most stable of" b'platforms, so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he' b'touched the helmets, mother of said child started shrieking at her kid "you' b'stay away from those you shit!" and whopped the tyke brutally about the head' b'and shoulders.' b'' b'i suppose it was our scary "sex drugs and unix" t-shirts that sent such' b'bouts of terror through her body.' b''
