b'' b'i have stated before that i do not consider myself an atheist, but' b'definitely do not believe in the christian god. the recent discussion' b'about atheists and hell, combined with a post to another group (to the' b"effect of 'you will all go to hell') has me interested in the consensus" b'as to how a god might judge men. as a catholic, i was told that a jew,' b'buddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not' b'believe this. even more see atheists and pagans (i assume i would be' b'lumped into this category) to be hellbound. i know you believe only' b'god can judge, and i do not ask you to, just for your opinions.' b'' b'thanks,' b'-tim'
