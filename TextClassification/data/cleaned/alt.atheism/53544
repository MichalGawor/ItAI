b'' b'' b"said re. dan schaertel's article [if i followed the quoting right]:" b'' b'' b' as much as anything else you learn. how do you choose what' b' to believe and what not to? i could argue that george' b" washington is a myth. he never lived because i don't have" b' any proof except what i am told. however all the major' b' events of the life of jesus christ were fortold hundreds of' b' years before him. neat trick uh?' b'' b' how is this? there is nothing more disgusting than christian attempts to' b' manipulate/interpret the old testament as being filled with signs for the' b' coming of christ. every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is' b' autmoatically interpreted as the cross. what a miscarriage of philology.' b'' b'i think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we' b"take the appellation `rabbi' seriously then jesus had a full" b"grasp of contemporary `scripture'" b'' b'mat21:42 jesus saith unto them, did ye never read in the scriptures...' b'' b'mat22:29 jesus answered and said unto them, ye do err, not knowing' b'mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of god.' b'' b'following from this, he would have been in a wonderful' b'position to fulfil prophesies, and the nt says as much:' b'' b'mat26:54 but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,' b'mat26:54 that thus it must be?' b'' b'mat26:56 but all this was done, that the scriptures of the' b'mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. then all the disciples' b'mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.' b'' b"if the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not" b'been accessible then it probably would be a different' b'matter.' b'' b'--tony'
