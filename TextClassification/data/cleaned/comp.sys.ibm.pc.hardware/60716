b'' b'experiences with diamond viper vlb video card' b'' b'several problems:' b'' b'1) the ad specified million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1mb' b'of vram, which is what i have. this color depth is not supported' b'with video bios version and drivers version a max of 65k' b'colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1mb' b'vram.' b'' b'2) with the 65k color choice i notice two minor irritations:' b'' b'a) under ndw, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an' b'open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often' b'remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to' b'be.' b'' b'b) with word for windows, when you use shading in a table, the' b'display shows the inverse of the shading; for example, if you' b'shade the cell as the display is (the printout is ok).' b'' b'3) the big killer bug is using the borland c++ integrated development' b'environment. the problem occurs when you click on the turbo debugger' b'icon (or use the debugger option in the run command), and the' b'debugger application goes to vga character mode (as it is designed' b'to do). the screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. the' b'turbo debugger display is all garbled.' b'' b'through trial and error, i have found that when the disrupted screen' b'is displayed you should do [alt-spacebar] followed by the letter' b'"r". this instructs turbo debugger to refresh the screen, and it' b"does this satisfactorily. i wish i didn't have to do this." b'' b'the bug is more than with the diamond drivers. the same disruptive' b'behavior happens with the standard vga driver that comes with' b'windows. there must be something in the video card that mishandles' b'the vga mode.' b'' b'the problem is not my monitor. the same bug shows up when i use' b'another monitor in place of my usual one.' b'' b'i still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be' b'remedied (they do offer a year warranty).' b'' b'---' b'swh, 20apr93'
