b'' b'' b"this may be a really dumb one, but i'll ask it anyways:" b'\tchristians know that they can never live up to the requirements of' b'god, right? (i may be wrong, but that is my understanding) but they still' b"try to do it. doesn't it seem like we are spending all of our lives" b'trying to reach a goal we can never achieve? i know that we are saved by' b"faith and not by works, but does that mean that once we are saved we don't" b'have to do anything? i think james tells us that faith without works is' b'dead (paraphrase). how does this work?' b'' b'so long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than' b'what we come to *want* to do, we miss the point. the more we love god; the' b'more we come to love what and whom he loves.' b'' b'when i find that what i am doing is not good, it is not a sign to try' b'even harder (romans it is a sign to seek god. when i am aware' b"of jesus' presence, i usually want what he wants. it is his strenth, his love" b'that empowers my weakness.' b'--' b"stan armstrong. religious studies dept, saint mary's university, halifax, n.s."
