b'' b'' b'i am *almost* done porting xfree86 to a new piece of display' b'hardware, but have run into a snag i think may be somewhat' b"commonplace, so i'm sending a net-feeler." b'' b'i have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit' b"720x280 display. the server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd b'xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be. however, the displayed' b'version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is' b'using scanlines that are too long. after a bit of experimentation, it' b'seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to' b'a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is bytes, which' b"isn't exactly divisible by four. changing the following defines in" b'mit/server/include/servermd.h:' b'' b'----' b'' b'#define bitmap_scanline_pad b'#define log2_bitmap_pad\t\t5' b'#define log2_bytes_per_scanline_pad\t2' b'' b'---' b'' b'to:' b'' b'---' b'' b'#define bitmap_scanline_pad b'#define log2_bitmap_pad\t\t4' b'#define log2_bytes_per_scanline_pad\t2' b'' b'---' b'' b'was not exactly the right solution. how do i tell the server either' b"(a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being" b'built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte' b'boundries?' b'' b"i'm using a customized version of xfree86v1.2, under mach b'' b'thanks' b'brian'
