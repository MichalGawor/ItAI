b'' b'' b'since the mac uses only scsi-1 for hard drives yes the "figure includes a' b'hundred for scsi drivers" this is sloppy people and dumb.' b'what group is this? this is not a mac group.' b' nice of you to delete both your responce and the item that prompted it.' b' to whit:' b'i just bought at quantum for my mac at home. i paid for it. i' b' b'' b'[tons of stuff deleted on scsi vs. ide question...]' b'' b'wow, you guys are really going wild on this ide vs. scsi thing, and i think' b"it's great!" b'' b"like lots of people, i'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from" b'the hard drive. right now i have a 15ms 210mb ide drive (seagate 1239a), and' b'what i would say is a standard (not special, no cache i believe) ide controller' b'card on my isa b'' b"i'm currently thinking about adding another hd, in the 300mb to 500mb range." b"and i'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)" b"about buying a scsi drive (scsi for the future benefit). i believe i'm getting" b'something like 890kb/sec transfer right now (according to nu). how would this' b'number compare if i bought the state-of-the-art scsi card for my isa pc, and' b'the state-of-the-art scsi hard drive (the wailing-est system i could hope for)?' b'obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would' b'you want to use on your isa system? and how much would it cost?' b'' b"along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd's if i" b'were to buy the top-of-the-line ide caching controller for my 200mb, 15ms hd?' b'and how much would it cost?' b'' b'i actually have a pas-16, and could (what a waste i guess it would be...) hook' b"up a scsi hd through it's scsi port which yields an optimum of 690kb/sec." b'actually, i have a borrowed 12ms fujitsu hd hooked up through it now (and' b'own the trantor hd drivers for the pas-16 scsi port). is this scsi port a' b'scsi-2 port? how could i tell? is the fujitsu 2623a a scsi-2? are all scsi' b"hd's scsi-2?" b'' b'thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.' b'' b'randy' b''
