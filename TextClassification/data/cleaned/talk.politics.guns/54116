b'' b' b" don't be silly. of course you can. the police have everything" b" the gangs have and then some. plus they've got access to the" b" national guard (via the governor) if things get too rough. that's" b" tanks for those of you who've never seen them at play. of course," b" they've got rifles and helicopters." b' b' and as far as fully-automatic weapons, you can be a lot better' b' armed if you want to hit what you aim at.' b'' b' what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally' b' blown out of proportion. in my post i was referring to your' b' regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs. gang' b' members. of course the police have access to the things that you' b' mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time? of' b" course they don't and that's the point i was trying to make. every" b' day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in. the' b' majority that i see are still carrying revolvers. not that there' b" is anything wrong with a revolver but if you're a cop that is up" b' against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat (i' b" mean semi-auto handguns) you're going to be at a disadvantage even" b' with training.' b'' b"how so? i think you're making assumptions here that might not" b'necessarily be true. -my- personal choice would be a semi-auto, but' b'revolvers are just as effective, if not more so.' b'' b' i have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were' b' "practicing" shooting. they were actually practicing taking out' b' their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they' b" weren't doing too badly either." b'' b'relevancy, please? you sound shocked, but that hardly proves anything.' b'' b' the university cops here (who are are state cops) are armed better' b" than the chicago police. it seems most state cops are. i don't" b' know where you are originally from david but you live in tennesse' b' and i live in chicago and see this crap everyday on the news and in' b' the papers. i think the situation is just a tad different here' b' than there.' b'' b"wait, doesn't chicago have -serious- gun control? if so, why do the" b'police need all that firepower in the first place? (sarcasm alert)' b'' b"all the patrol cars i've seen around here have shotguns clamped to" b"the dash board. imho, that's all the police need to outgun just about" b'anything.' b'' b'jason' b'' b'--' b'`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`' b'`,` the crystal wind is the storm, and the storm is data, and the data b"`,` is life the player's litany, from _the long run_ by d.k. moran
