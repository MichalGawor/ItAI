b'' b'' b'there is a person on the fido cfs echo who claims that he was cured of' b'cfs by taking accutane. he also claims that you are using it in the' b'treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome. are you using accutane in the' b'treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome?' b'' b'yes.' b'' b'have you used it for cfs?' b'' b'it seems to work equally well for cfs, another hint that these may be' b'different facets of the same underlying process.' b'' b'have you gotten good results with it?' b'' b'yes. the benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it.' b'most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose' b'amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule' b'(current standard therapy). because of the cost (usually $150/mo.,' b'depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like' b'corneal injury and birth defects, i currently reserve it for those who' b'fail conventional treatment. it is important that the person' b'prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient' b'closely.' b'' b'are you aware of any double blind studies on the use of accutane in' b'these conditions? thank you in advance for all replies.' b'' b'as far as i know, i am the only person looking at it currently. i' b"should get off my duff and finish writing up some case reports. i'm not" b"an academic physician, so i don't feel the pressure to publish or perish" b"and i don't have the time during the work day for such things." b'' b'this is patently absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher' b'must learn not to be frightened by absurdities. bertrand russell'
