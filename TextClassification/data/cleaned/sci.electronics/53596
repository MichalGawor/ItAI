b'' b"so.. here's my question. it seems to me that i'd have the" b'same electrical circuit if i hooked the neutral jumper from the' b"neutral over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding" b"outlets. what's wrong with my reasoning here?" b'' b'first, go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of "wiring' b'simplified" by h.l. richter. now if your house is wired with metal' b"conduit, you don't need a seperate ground wire (assuming the house" b'is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water' b'pipe in your basement). the outlets that have a neutral hooked to' b'the ground screw seem wrong. anyone else think so?' b'' b"back in the 70's i was a service technician for a cash register company." b'the cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were' b'very susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise. the biggest' b'problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.' b'' b'in almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets' b'with the ground connected to the neutral. for of the things you' b'can plug into one of these, they work fine. for our cash registers they' b'were a nightmare line noise tended to scramble the memory' b'periodically.' b'' b'with modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be' b'less of a problem. even the company i used to work for is no longer' b'recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their' b'equipment. i imagine if you check most household wiring you will find' b'that the ground and neutral are connected. although not ideal, it' b'should be o.k. for most applications.' b'' b'---' b'. slmr my reality check just bounced.' b'' b'----' b'the ozone hole bbs a private bulletin board service b'3 full service nodes usrobotics 16.8k bps gigs files' b'skydive new orleans! rime network mail hub usenet newsgroups'
