b'' b'' b'ask the brits. enough people have been killed by rubber bullets that they now' b'use them under only certain "controlled" circumstances. and they are fired' b'from something that looks like a tear gas launcher.' b'' b'there are smaller rubber bullets and pellets (for shotguns). i understand that' b'they are only intended to be discouragers, ie. for the snapping but not truly' b'dangerous animal. in general, they do not seem capable of really stopping' b'someone who wants you or past you. they are fired at very low muzzle velocity' b'(the ball round is intended for a 400fps load). finally, as your mother' b'warned you, you can put an eye out with that thing. b'--' b'oh, ok. just wondering. i am not a real expert on weapons, i was just' b'wondering if they would do the job.' b'' b'doug holland' b''
