b'' b'' b'i am currently attempting to get a copy of the hp widget set compiled' b'under linux (sls release with kernel and am running into some' b'problems. actually, it seems that this is more of a gcc question,' b'because i got it to compile without trouble using cc on an rs/6000.' b'basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes' b"set up in, let's say, compositep.h, for instance, the composite" b"widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type b'' b'typedef void (*xtwidgetproc) (widget)' b'' b'but in several places in the hp source code, they reference the' b'insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just' b'one, as the prototype suggests. for example:' b'' b'(*superclass-composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)' b'' b'now, gcc chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments' b'are passed to the function. so, does anyone have any suggestions as to' b'how to turn off this checking in gcc, or how i can go about changing the' b'code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/x11/compositep.h,' b'or has anyone successfully built the hp widget set and have any suggestions.' b'many thanks in advance for any help.' b'' b'--' b'<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<' b'graphics group b'i am the terror that flaps in the night.'
