b'' b'i have a 486dx-33 isa pc-compatible (insight) with an infotel internal' b'14.4fax/14.4data modem with quicklinkii for windows. when i first put the' b'modem in, i pulled a phone out of the jack in another room, and ran a phone' b'line extension to my surge protector and then my computer. the modem' b'worked fine. then i split the line from the jack in the other room, ran' b'the line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer. then' b'i got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem.' b'now when i try to use the modem, quicklinkii says "no dialtone". the phone' b'plugged into the back of the computer works fine. i tried unplugging the' b'phone, but still no dice. is it that the phone line was split too many' b"times? (i don't understand how this could be a problem, since the phone" b'worked fine.) please note: none of the software or hardware parameters' b'were changed, only the phone line itself. is my new modem faulty? what' b'can i do?' b'' b'--' b'of new york "if music be the food of love,
