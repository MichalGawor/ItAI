b'' b'everyone keeps talking about european expansion by thinking' b'wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.' b'' b'the league format we use here is incompatible with that in europe.' b"(for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions get" b'promoted and the worst get demoted).' b'' b'would european fans put up with our "if you\'ve paid, you can play"' b'attitude??' b'' b'how long would they support teams that are run on ranger-based' b"corporate thinking (i use the term lightly).
