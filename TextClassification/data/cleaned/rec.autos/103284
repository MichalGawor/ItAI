b'' b'' b'i would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic' b'transmissions from all "performance-type" cars (like the 5.0l' b"mustangs, camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of" b'accidents each year. autos are fine for sedate little sedans,' b'but they have no business in performance cars, imho.' b'' b'\t\t\t\tjames' b'' b'i have to disagree with this. i have a z28 with a and a 4-speed auto' b'w/ overdrive, and it is really better that way. chevy autos are reknowned' b'for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power. i live' b'in the dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic' b'here. now if i still lived out in the sticks like i used to, a manual would be' b'more fun.' b'' b"i don't know if it's as much an issue of their ablility to handle the" b'power as it is the power they lose (in the torque converter, etc).' b'' b'safety-wise, an auto is less distracting...i would hate to have to be' b'shifting gears while i was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here.' b'performance-wise, i can hold my own against any stock mustang or b'camaro w/ a five speed.' b'' b"however, if you encounter a formula with 5.7l 6-speed manual," b"you'll be sol, i'm afraid. btw, i know of what i speak as a former" b'owner of a 5.7l auto iroc and current owner of the' b'aforementioned car...' b'' b'chris s.' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'chris silvester "any man capable of getting himself elected president' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
