b'' b'i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few' b'questions about windows for workgroups.' b'' b'i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with' b'windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. b'i am considering moving all our machines to w4wg.' b'' b'q1: how much conventional ram does w4wg use over and above the' b' driver for the network card?' b'' b'i have just checked it and you have three files that are loaded:' b'protman bytes' b'driver\t: bytes' b'workgrp\t: bytes' b'' b'q2: if i have a novell ne2000 card, are the lsl and ipx drivers' b' still needed?' b'' b"no w4wg uses it's own drivers." b'' b'q3: does w4wg do a license check over the network to ensure each' b' machine is running its own licenced copy of w4wg? (note: i do' b' not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy' b' of w4wg for each of our machines, it is just that i would like' b' to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. returning one' b' opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies.)' b'' b'not that i know of, i bought two copies, had some problems with one' b'installed both from the same copie, no problems. do worry i just had' b"a really old bios and that's the only problem i got." b'' b'q4: if you buy the upgrade to windows for w4wg does it replace' b' all of win as you install it or does it depend on current' b' win files?' b'it will replace all older files (i think) and prompt you for the' b'others.' b'' b'q5: if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out, will i have' b' any troubles with the w4wg machines?' b'' b'this i do not know...' b'' b'when i started this message, i was going to ask only questions but i got carried' b"away. i'll stop now b'' b'i look forward to your replies.' b'' b'al' b'' b'' b'hope this helps' b'' b'gel' b''
