b'' b'' b'' b'there was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams' b"no matter ow bad they are. that's bullshit. anyone who would follow the" b'pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are' b"losers. it's ok to follow and be concerned about your home team. but" b'to give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck' b'should not be required of a true fan.a true fan would follow the team in' b'troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.' b'' b"when i visit pittsburgh, i'll refuse to go to a pirates game since i think" b'the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better' b"even if they couldn't sign barry bonds. lert's say the pens start doing to" b'their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have' b'done in recent years, i would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the' b"team. i'll still follow it and bitch about it. but i won't waste my" b'money on mediocre teams.' b'' b'-p{ravin ratnam'
