b'' b'' b" i am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and i've hit a snag." b' in my application i want to be able to change the gain of an' b' op amp amplifier from to controlable via a digital input.' b" the most obvious way i've come up with is to use analog switches" b' to adjust the gain of the op amp. the only analog switch i have' b' experience with it the unfortunately i want to switch an' b' ac signal which goes from about -5v to 5v, and the is only' b' for positive signals.' b'' b'' b'i have recently used the to switch a bipolar signal. i simply' b'ran the off a bipolar supply, 8v in this case. as long as your' b'analog input signal stays between the supply rails, the will work fine.' b'of course, your control (logic) input must use -8v as the logic low and' b'+8v as the logic high reference, so that either all your driving logic' b'must be cmos with the same bipolar supply or you must provide' b'some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the and the' b'control logic. in my case, i was able to use the bipolar supply all the' b'way.' b'' b'' b'----' b'san jose, ca
