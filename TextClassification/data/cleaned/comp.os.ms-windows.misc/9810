b'' b'' b'' b"so good that there isn't any diff whether or not atmanager is turned" b'on or not. is it worth it to run atm at all? especially with these' b'better printer technologies and tt?' b'' b'there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts. if you' b'have a ps font that you want to use, use atm. otherwise, it is' b'a waste of system resources.' b'' b'' b"-----or, if you need to use a service bureau and they're only set up to use" b"type fonts. from what i've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting" b'tt fonts as type is _not_ as good as using high-quality type fonts in' b'the first place.' b'' b"unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for the" b'final output device (image setter). a problem with tt fonts in windows' b'is that they do get converted to t1 format ok, and the hinting is even used' b'while this is done, but the resulting t1 fonts are not hinted. the result' b'is that they will work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the' b'printer driver when the ps file is generated, but they will not look' b'good when printed at a different resolution.' b'' b'so when you print to an attached ps printer, with the ps driver set up for' b'this printer results, may be quite good. but if you take a ps file made for' b'that printer and run it on a device of different resolution (such as an' b'image setter), then the results may not be so good.'
