b'' b'does anyone have a reference (something i can look up, not just your own' b'recollections i have a few of those myself) on the temperature of the' b'(night) sky as seen from space?' b'' b'note, i am *not* talking about the temperature of the microwave background' b"radiation. there are more things in the sky than just the mbr; what i'm" b'after is total blackbody temperature what a thermal radiator would see,' b'disregarding (or shielding against) the sun and nearby large warm objects.' b'my dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is substantially' b'higher than that of the mbr, once you figure in things like stars and the' b"zodiacal light, but i'd like numbers." b'--' b'' b"it's not quite what you were asking, but a few years ago i helped some ee" b'remote sensing people run some experiments on the microwave emmissivity of' b'ice; they used the sky for a background calibration source. they said that' b"from earth's surface the sky looks like a 60k blackbody." b'' b'--' b'dr. kurt hillig' b'dept. of chemistry i always tell the phone
