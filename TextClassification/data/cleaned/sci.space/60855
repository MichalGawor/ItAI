b'' b'' b' is anybody out there willing to discuss with me careers in the army that deal' b' with space? after i graduate, i will have a commitment to serve in the army,' b' and i would like to spend it in a space-related field. i saw a post a long' b' time ago about the air force space command which made a fleeting reference to' b" its army counter-part. any more info on that would be appreciated. i'm" b' looking for things like: do i branch intelligence, or signal, or other? to' b' whom do i voice my interest in space? what qualifications are necessary?' b' etc, etc. btw, my major is computer science engineering.' b'' b"kerry-- i'm guessing a little at this, because it's been a few years" b'since i saw the info, but you will probably want to look at air defense' b"artillery as a specialty, or possibly signals. the kind of thing you're" b"looking for is sdi-type assignments, but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff." b'things like hard-kill atbm missiles, some of the cobra rigs that kind' b'of thing.' b'' b'hope that gives you some ideas on where to look, though.' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------' b'shakala bbs (clanzen radio network) sunnyvale, ca
