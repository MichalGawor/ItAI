b'' b'' b" huckabay's counting frames for bat speed discussion ommited...}" b'' b'' b" well, it's just studying tape, frame by frame. that's all. the biggest" b' thing that you notice, however, is how bastardized the strike zone has' b' become. death to the umpires\' union! the plate is across,' b' not call the high strikes strikes, and quit calling pitches b" outside strikes they're balls!" b'' b'' b' speaking of this wide strike zone....' b'' b" i'd sure like to see cameras placed in each major league park such that" b' an overview shot of home plate is available. cbs had this during the' b' ws, or did i just dream it.' b'' b' these pictures would be a feedback device for the umpires so that they can' b' see just how terrible (or not) there calls were. tapes could be sent to' b' the league as evidence of bad ball/strike umpiring. tapes are available' b' as evidence of bad out/safe calls on the bases.' b'' b'i guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series (and, in' b'fact all year) have been pretty much consistently correct. remember: the rule' b"says it's a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone." b'' b'i would certainly agree that high strikes are not called (who could argue' b'this point?) but all in all i think in and out is called pretty well.' b'' b'' b'rstimets' b'' b'' b''
