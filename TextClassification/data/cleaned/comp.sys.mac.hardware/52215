b'' b'i ordered an external floppy drive from them years ago. when i placed' b'the order, they said it was in stock and would ship the next day. a week' b'passed and no drive. i called them up and they said they were out of stock' b'and my drive should ship in weeks or so. since i needed the drive right' b'away (both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead) i cancelled my' b"order and haven't dealt with them since." b'' b'chris kidwell'
