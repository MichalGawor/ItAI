b'' b'' b'what if i act morally for no particular reason? then am i moral? what' b'if morality is instinctive, as in most animals?' b'saying that morality is instinctive in animals is an attempt to' b'assume your conclusion.' b'which conclusion?' b'you conclusion correct me if i err that the behaviour which is' b'instinctive in animals is a "natural" moral system.' b'' b'see, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here. earlier, you said' b'that it must be a conscious act. by your definition, no instinctive' b'behavior pattern could be an act of morality. you are trying to apply' b'human terms to non-humans. i think that even if someone is not conscious' b'of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.' b'' b"you don't think that morality is a behavior pattern? what is human" b'morality? a moral action is one that is consistent with a given' b'pattern. that is, we enforce a certain behavior as moral.' b'you keep getting this backwards. *you* are trying to show that' b'the behaviour pattern is a morality. whether morality is a behavior' b'pattern is irrelevant, since there can be behavior pattern, for' b'example the motions of the planets, that most (all?) people would' b'not call a morality.' b'' b"i try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown." b'' b'and, morality can be thought of a large class of princples. it could be' b'defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish. however,' b'it seems silly to talk of a "moral" planet because it obeys the laws of' b'phyics. it is less silly to talk about animals, as they have at least' b'some free will.' b'' b'keith'
