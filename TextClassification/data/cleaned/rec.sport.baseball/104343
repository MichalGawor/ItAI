b'' b'' b'oops! i came across this file from last year. thought you might' b'enjoy some of these thoughts. the predictions were made on the' b'date indicated. they are largely out of order.' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'june b'what have i done? i computed the "expected winning percentage" for' b'each team from their obp, total bases, and runs allowed. i use the' b'basic rc formula and the pythagorean projection. i then compare this' b'with their actual winning percentage. all stats through june b'' b'team obp tb ra w l xwp diff' b'baltimore b'boston b'toronto b'new york b'milwaukee b'detroit b'cleveland b'' b'minnesota b'oakland b'texas b'chicago b'california b'kansas city b'seattle b'' b'you all know how things turned out. the orioles, red sox, and yankees' b'all disappeared. the jays and tigers continued at essentially the' b'expected pace. the brewers and indians cranked in the second half.' b'' b"the rangers predictably took a dive. that shouldn't have surprised" b'anybody. meanwhile, as predicted, the mariners dropped behind the' b"angels and royals. they clearly didn't deserve the record in" b"june. the white sox and a's upped their game a bit, while the twins" b'dropped off a little. but for the most part things were as expected.' b'' b'okay, so there were a few blatant errors. but for a predictive' b'calculation, i thought this did pretty well.' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'1. the braves insert kent mercker into the starting rotation' b'sometime this year bielecki is traded or released, lei-' b'brandt becomes the fifth starter, and the best bullpen in baseball' b'has pena, berenguer, stanton, wohlers, freeman, and pete smith, who' b'spot-starts as well.' b'' b'hm. pete smith made the rotation instead of mercker. and bielecki' b"wasn't released until the end of the year. i won't comment on the" b'bullpen.
