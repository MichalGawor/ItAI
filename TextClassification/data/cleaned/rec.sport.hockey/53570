b'' b' about or weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex; it' b' went something like [sarcastically]:' b' "yep, patty\'s the man. he\'s responsible for the team\'s success...i\'m a' b' nobody around here."' b'' b'how can you assume it was a sarcastic remark?' b'for someone whose first language is not english, i would interpret' b'that comment to mean that he believes pat is the mvp on the team and that' b'he is just one of the other normal players. quite modest i might say.' b'' b"well, i don't recall assuming anything, except perhaps that the columnist" b'who reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the sarcastic impression' b'came from _him_ (steve simmons?). besides, to my knowledge alex has a pretty' b'fair grasp of the english language...and his recent comment after the detroit' b'game would indicate that this remark _is_ what i think it to be. very low.' b'' b''
