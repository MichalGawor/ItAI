b'' b'' b'have you head of small claims. you may have to put money up' b'front for the filing fees, and then possibly having the local' b'sheriff of his/her city to deliver the bad news. in the end' b'the other party will end up paying for his/her mistake with' b'interest from the time of the filing to the pay date of the' b'defendent' b'' b'i think the problem with small claims court is that you have to go to' b"the location of the person you're taking action against. it seems to" b'me the time and money involved in travelling out there (unless this' b"person is close to you) wouldn't be worth it for a small claim." b"it really depends on how much money you're out." b'' b'if i am wrong about any of this, someone please correct me! b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------' b'kenneth simon dept of sociology, indiana university' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------'
