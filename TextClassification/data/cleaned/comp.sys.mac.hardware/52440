b'' b"i have a question for y'all:" b'' b'i\'m looking at an ad for the new fast scsi-2 drives from micropolis' b'in the june, macworld. (i have seen similar ads for the ide versions' b'in ibm pc magazines)' b'' b'well, the ad says that all three drives have a fast scsi-2 interface,' b'but then it says that the dtr rate for each drive is megabytes/second,' b'*max*.' b'' b'how can this be? i thought that if a drive was to be fast scsi-2 it' b'had to have a dtr of 10megs a second?' b'' b'(i am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by micropolis is from the 512k cache.' b'i admit that i would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data' b'at 5megs a second!)' b'' b'thank you.' b''
