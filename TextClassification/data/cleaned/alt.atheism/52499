is there to discuss?' b'' b'response:' b'' b'many things are discussed here, including:' b'' b"* whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's" b'family' b'* prayer in schools' b'* discrimination against atheists' b'* sunday trading laws' b'* the satanic child abuse myth' b"* whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'" b'* how religious societies prey (sic) on new college students' b'* how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers' b'* whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual' b'* why people become atheists' b'' b'of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical christians' b"looking for someone to convert. most readers of the newsgroup don't" b'want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure' b'from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!' b'' b'response:' b'' b'adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist. as he said himself:' b'' b'the folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in' b'his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_' b"superficially_of_god's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_god's_will,_and_" b"not_let_god's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]" b'' b"for god's will gave men their form, their essence, and their" b'abilities. anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the' b"lord's creation, the divine will. therefore, let every man be" b'active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every' b'man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who' b'in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his' b'religious community and tries to butt into the other.' b'' b'[...]' b'' b'hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will' b'of the almighty creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_jew,_i_am_' b'fighting_for_the_work_of_the_lord._[orig. ital.]' b'' b'-- adolf hitler, from "mein kampf", trans. ralph mannheim.' b'' b'of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief' b"wrong. it's also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed" b"to believe in god. we certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist," b'though.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'in the bible it says that...' b'' b'response:' b'' b'most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the bible is of questionable' b'accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were' b'recording oral tradition that existed many years before. thus, any claimed' b"'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy. this isn't to say that the" b'bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being' b'accepted.' b'' b'many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is' b'subject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage \'means\' one thing and' b'one thing only is not legitimate.' b'' b'note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.' b'' b'it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other' b'equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing b"but if you don't believe in god and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to" b'hell. therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.' b'' b'response:' b'' b"this argument is known as pascal's wager. it has several flaws." b'' b'firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow. indeed, there are' b'many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there. this is often' b'described as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem. if a person is a' b"follower of religion x, he may end up in religion y's version of hell." b'' b'secondly, the statement that "if you believe in god and turn out to be' b'incorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true. suppose you\'re believing in' b'the wrong god the true god might punish you for your foolishness.' b'consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in' b'favour of prayer.' b'' b'another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that' b'the two possibilities are equally likely or at least, that they are of' b'comparable likelihood. if, in fact, the possibility of there being a god' b'is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive. so sadly the' b'argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.' b'' b'also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on' b'evidence, with some amount of intuition. it is not a matter of will or' b'cost-benefit analysis.' b'' b'formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:' b'' b'1. one does not know whether god exists.' b"2. not believing in god is bad for one's eternal soul if god does" b'exist.' b'3. believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist.' b"4. therefore it is in one's interest to believe in god." b'' b'there are two approaches to the argument. the first is to view as an' b'assumption, and as a consequence of it. one problem with this approach, in' b'the abstract, is that it creates information from no information. this is' b'considered invalid in information theory. statement indicates one has no' b'information about god but statement indicates that beneficial information' b'can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god. this violates' b'information entropy information has been extracted from no information, at' b'no "cost".' b'' b'the alternative approach is to claim that and are both assumptions. the' b'problem with this is that is then basically an assumption which states the' b'christian position, and only a christian will agree with that assumption. the' b'argument thus collapses to "if you are a christian, it is in your interests' b'to believe in god" a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way pascal' b'intended the argument to be viewed.' b'' b"the biggest reason why pascal's wager is a failure is that if god is" b'omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as' b'a wager. he will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all' b'whether people believe in him.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b"people keep talking about occam's razor. what is it?" b'' b'response:' b'' b"william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occam's" b'razor. in its original form, it said "do not multiply entities' b'unnecessarily." that is, if you can explain something without supposing' b'the existence of some entity, then do so.' b'' b"nowadays when people refer to occam's razor, they generally express it" b'more generally, for example as "take the simplest solution".' b'' b'the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations' b'for what we see around us:' b'' b'1. there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which' b'came into being as a result of natural processes.' b'' b'2. there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and' b'there is also a god who created the universe. clearly this god must be' b'of non-zero complexity.' b'' b"given that both explanations fit the facts, occam's razor might suggest" b'that we should take the simpler of the two solution number one.' b'unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:' b'' b"3. there isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there." b'we just imagine that there is.' b'' b'this third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people' b'find unacceptable.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.' b'' b'response:' b'' b'preaching is not appreciated.' b'' b'feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that' b'are on a "conversion" theme. such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and' b'will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup' b'talk.religion.misc).' b'' b'you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite' b'newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would' b'have them do unto you!' b'' b'often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy' b'analogies or parables. be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the' b'basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell' b'atheists that god exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,' b'since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'i *know* from personal experience and prayer that god exists.' b'' b'response:' b'' b'just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship' b'exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not' b'exist. that evidence varies from person to person.' b'' b'furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many' b'people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things that they have been' b'abducted by ufos, visited by the ghost of elvis, and so on.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b"albert einstein believed in god. do you think you're cleverer than him?" b'' b'response:' b'' b'einstein did once comment that "god does not play dice [with the universe]".' b'this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the' b"christian god. used this way, it is out of context; it refers to einstein's" b'refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. furthermore,' b"einstein's religious background was jewish rather than christian." b'' b'a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following:' b'"i believe in spinoza\'s god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of' b'what exists, not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of' b'human beings."' b'' b'einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an' b'objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random' b'events and which would not be dependent upon the observer. he believed that' b'qm was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for' b'statistical interpretations. so far no such better theory has been found,' b'and much evidence suggests that it never will be.' b'' b'a longer quote from einstein appears in "science, philosophy, and religion, a' b'symposium", published by the conference on science, philosophy and religion' b'in their relation to the democratic way of life, inc., new york, in' b'it he says:' b'' b'"the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events' b'the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side' b'of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. for him' b'neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an' b'independent cause of natural events. to be sure, the doctrine of a' b'personal god interfering with natural events could never be' b'*refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this' b'doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific' b'knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.' b'' b'but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives' b'of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. for a doctrine' b'which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,' b'will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm' b'to human progress. in their struggle for the ethical good, teachers' b'of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal' b'god, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past' b'placed such vast power in the hands of priests. in their labors they' b'will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable' b'of cultivating the good, the true, and the beautiful in humanity' b'itself. this is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably' b'more worthy task..."' b'' b'einstein has also said:' b'' b'"it was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,' b'a lie which is being systematically repeated. i do not believe in a' b'personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.' b'if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the' b'unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our' b'science can reveal it."' b'' b'the latter quote is from "albert einstein: the human side", edited by helen' b'dukas and banesh hoffman, and published by princeton university press.' b'also from the same book:' b'' b'"i do not believe in immortality of the individual, and i consider ethics' b'to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind' b'it."' b'' b'of course, the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does' b'not in itself imply that christianity is false.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b"everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or god." b'' b'response:' b'' b'if that is true, everyone is a polytheist. theists care just as much about' b"those things that atheists care about. if the atheists' reactions to (for" b"example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'." b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so' b'chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.' b'' b'response:' b'' b'the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has' b'no smallest member.' b'' b'further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does' b'not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and' b'especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by' b'any particular religion.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god. surely you' b"don't think all this appeared here just by chance?" b'' b'response:' b'' b'this is known as the argument from design.' b'' b'it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the' b'universe. those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living' b'creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the' b'newsgroup talk.origins for a while.' b'' b'there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.' b'however, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of' b'so-called scientific creationism. furthermore, there is much evidence,' b'observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the' b'universe and life on earth.' b'' b'the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of' b'something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that' b"surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some" b'external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos' b'deliberately.' b'' b'but if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind' b'capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must' b'be immeasurably more unlikely? the approach used to argue in favour of the' b'existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist' b'position.' b'' b'this leads us to the familiar theme of "if a creator created the universe,' b'what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling' b'improbability. the only way out is to declare that the creator was not' b'created and just "is" (or "was").' b'' b'from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe' b'just "is" without introducing a creator? indeed stephen hawking, in his book' b'"a brief history of time", explains his theory that the universe is closed' b'and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.' b'' b'the argument from design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called' b'watchmaker argument. one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on' b'the beach. does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it' b'evolved naturally? of course one assumes a watchmaker. yet like the' b'watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the' b'universe too must have a creator.' b'' b'the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above' b'those common to all arguments by design. firstly, a watchmaker creates' b'watches from pre-existing materials, whereas god is claimed to have' b'created the universe from nothing. these two sorts of creation are' b'clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.' b'' b'secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in' b'the world. if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear' b"reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker. the argument" b'would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a' b'different part of creation.' b'' b'finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that' b'the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore' b'stands out from the randomness of nature. yet in the second part of the' b'argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not' b'random, but shows elements of order. the watchmaker argument is thus' b'internally inconsistent.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary' b'evidence. for example...' b'' b'response:' b'' b'the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary' b'evidence.' b'' b"early versions of josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or" b'james; the extant version discusses john in a non-christian context. many' b'scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing, but' b'that this was expanded by christian copyists. several "reconstructions" of' b'the original text have been published to this effect.' b'' b'much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius (about b'c.e.). it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate' b"falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the" b"first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' it is eusebius who is" b'generally given the title of authorship for this material.' b'' b'aside from the new testament, the biographical information about jesus is' b'more well-documented. for further information, please consult the frequently' b'asked questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b"godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the" b'bible to be both true and complete.' b'' b'response:' b'' b"godel's first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal" b'system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary' b'arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be' b"valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system. (technically" b'speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision' b'procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal' b'system.)' b'' b'essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "liar' b'paradox." the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is "this' b'sentence is false." note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal' b'system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.' b'' b'the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims' b"that godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to" b'prove or disprove) the existence of god are worthless in isolation.' b'' b'one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the' b'existence of god, simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom.' b'this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.' b'' b'it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms' b'that both atheists and theists agree with. it may then be possible to show' b"that godel's incompleteness theorem holds for that system. however, that" b'would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists' b"within the system. furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about" b'whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally.' b'' b'note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about' b'the actual existence of god; the formal systems are just abstractions.' b'' b"another frequent claim is that godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates" b'that a religious text (the bible, the book of mormon or whatever) cannot be' b'both consistent and universally applicable. religious texts are not formal' b'systems, so such claims are nonsense.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?' b'' b'response:' b'' b'the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i.' b'sherman of american atheist press and george bush, on august sherman' b'is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of' b'the press corps. the republican presidential nominee was there to announce' b'federal disaster relief for illinois. the discussion turned to the' b'presidential primary:' b'' b'rs: "what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists?"' b'' b'gb: "i guess i\'m pretty weak in the atheist community. faith in' b'god is important to me."' b'' b'rs: "surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of' b'americans who are atheists?"' b'' b'gb: "no, i don\'t know that atheists should be considered as citizens,' b'nor should they be considered patriots. this is one nation under' b'god."' b'' b'rs: "do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation' b'of state and church?"' b'' b'gb: "yes, i support the separation of church and state. i\'m just not' b'very high on atheists."' b'' b'upi reported on may that various atheist organizations were' b'still angry over the remarks.' b'' b'the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february b'1989. it can also be found in "free enquiry" magazine, fall issue,' b'volume number page b'' b'on october mr. sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane,' b"cochairman of the bush-quayle illinois campaign. this concerned a" b'lawsuit mr. sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school' b'district (chicago, illinois) from forcing his first-grade atheist son to' b'pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as "one nation under god"' b"(bush's phrase). the following conversation took place:" b'' b'rs: "american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday.' b'does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"' b'' b'em: "it\'s bullshit."' b'' b'rs: "what is bullshit?"' b'' b'em: "everything that american atheists does, rob, is bullshit."' b'' b'rs: "thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush' b'campaign is on this issue."' b'' b'em: "you\'re welcome."' b'' b"after bush's election, american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract" b'his statement. on february 21st c. boyden gray, counsel to the' b'president, replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by' b'his original statement, and wrote:' b'' b'"as you are aware, the president is a religious man who neither supports' b'atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or' b'supported by the government."' b'' b'for further information, contact american atheist veterans at the american' b"atheist press's cameron road address." b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'i know where hell is! hell is in norway!' b'' b'response:' b'' b'there are several towns called "hell" in various countries around the' b'world, including norway and the usa. whilst this information is mildly' b'amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now' b'getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'does anyone have a list of biblical contradictions?' b'' b'response:' b'' b"american atheist press publish an atheist's handbook detailing biblical" b'contradictions. see the accompanying posting on atheist resources for' b'details.' b'' b'there is a file containing some biblical contradictions available from the' b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b"because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the" b'united states be considered a christian nation?' b'' b'response:' b'' b'based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear' b'that they never intended the us to be a christian nation. here are some' b'quotes; there are many more.' b'' b'"what influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?' b'in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the' b'ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen' b'upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been' b'the guardians of the liberties of the people. rulers who wish to subvert' b'the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient' b'auxiliaries. a just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,' b'needs them not."' b'- james madison, "a memorial and remonstrance", b'' b'"i almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of' b'the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the cross.' b'consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"' b'- john adams, in a letter to thomas jefferson' b'' b'"history i believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people' b'maintaining a free civil government. this marks the lowest grade of' b'ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will' b'always avail themselves for their own purpose."' b'' b'- thomas jefferson to baron von humboldt, b'' b'"i cannot conceive otherwise than that he, the infinite father, expects or' b'requires no worship or praise from us, but that he is even infinitely' b'above it."' b'' b'- benjamin franklin, from "articles of belief and acts of religion",' b'nov. b'' b'------------------------------' b'' b'' b'typical posting:' b'' b'is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any' b'sense founded upon the christian religion?' b'' b'response:' b'' b'no. the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the treaty' b'of tripoli stat treaty series b'' b'article b'' b'as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense' b'founded on the christian religion, as it has in itself no character of' b'enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of musselmen, and as' b'the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility' b'against any mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no' b'pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption' b'of the harmony existing between the two countries.' b'' b'the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections' b'such as charles bevans\' "treaties and other international agreements of the' b'united states of america vol.
