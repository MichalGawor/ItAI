b'' b'my friend recently purchased a lc iii and he wants to know if there is' b'such a demon called nubus adapter for his pds slot?' b'' b' the lc family of macs can only' b' use pds cards. they are not able to use nubus.' b'' b'ah, but why? can some technically-hip macslinger tell us what the' b'difference is between pds and nubus?' b'' b'is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into pds and ends in a' b"nubus card cage? at least, marvin's friend has not been able to" b'locate one and neither have i. what is the fundamental reason for' b'this?' b'' b'--' b" o~~* b' _\\~~~~~~~~~~~zap!' b' b' bill higgins fermi national accelerator laboratory' b' span/hepnet: 43011::higgins' b'second wave makes nubus card cages that work on the pds slots of at' b'least three macs: the se/30, iisi and centris they have not, to' b'my knowledge, announced such a device for the lcii, but they could' b'make one, technologically.' b'' b'the pds card that goes to the cage simply needs the nubus controller' b'circuitry present on nubus macs.' b'' b'why, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-pds' b'adapter for the lc/lcii. they will soon have one for the lciii. pds' b'is better than nubus for most people in most applications. granted,' b'there are more nubus cards. but, most applications that require a' b"nubus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an" b'lc/lcii/lciii anyway.' b'' b'mark'
