b'' b'this may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first time' b"i've ever had a need for this:" b'' b"i've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things" b'like photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logic' b'high, etc.).' b'' b"anyway, i've got some servos lying around, and i wanted to do some things" b'with them using digital logic. i know all about having to pulse the signal' b"and everything, i just have one problem: i'm assuming i need a negative" b'(yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction' b'opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.' b'' b"is a negative logic high (i've seen this in schematics) the same thing as" b"an active low, or what? i'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how" b'would i get a negative logic high out of this thing? i need to have all' b'three signals available: logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.' b'' b'any help would be greatly appreciated. also, please reply via email, as i' b'never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.' b'' b'thanks much,' b'-mark' b'' b'' b'' b''
