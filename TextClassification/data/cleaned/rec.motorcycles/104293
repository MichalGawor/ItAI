b'' b'' b'' b'i was attacked by a rabid hubcap once. i was going to work on a yamaha' b'750 twin (a.k.a. "the vibrating tank") when i heard a wierd noise off to my' b'left. i caught a glimpse of something silver headed for my left foot and' b'jerked it up about a nanosecond before my bike was hit hard in the left' b'side. when i went to put my foot back on the peg, i found that it was not' b'there! i pulled into the nearest parking lot and discovered that i had been' b'hit by a wire-wheel type hubcap from a large cage! this hubcap weighed' b'about pounds! the impact had bent the left peg flat against the frame' b'and tweeked the shifter in the process. had i not heard the approaching' b'cap, i feel certian that i would be sans a portion of my left foot.' b'' b'hmmmm.....i wondered where that hubcap went.' b'' b'--' b'dod #650<-----------------------------------------------------------darkman' b'the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of' b'thinking we were at when we created them. albert einstein' b'___________________the eternal champion_________________'
