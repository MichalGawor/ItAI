b'' b'' b'hi,' b'' b"in canada, any gun that enters a national park must be sealed (i think it's a" b"small metal tag that's placed over the trigger). the net result of this is" b"that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the" b'national parks. instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances' b'of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.' b'' b'i think this policy makes the users of the national parks feel a little closer' b'to nature, that they are a part of nature and, as such, have to deal with' b"nature on it's own terms." b'' b'guy' b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i understand this philosophy. the bears are a national' b'treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it' b'do so at their own risk. it is better that that rare human be' b'killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy' b"visitors. the bears aren't having a population explosion, humans" b'are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears.' b"i don't agree with this philosopy, but i understand it." b'' b'the psychos are a bit different. they are not a national' b'treasure but i suppose the decision has been made that to "allow"' b'provision for defense against them would also "allow" provision' b'for defense against bears. again, i suppose it has been decided' b'that it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than' b'to take a chance on threatening the bears.' b'' b"personally, i wouldn't go into an area where i would be" b'"managed" so as to reduce my safety but come to think' b'of it i guess i live in a managed wilderness myself b'' b'joan v' b'' b''
