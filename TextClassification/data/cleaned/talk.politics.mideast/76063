b'' b'i flipped on my local cable access channel (a channel where any' b'community member can broadcast whatever they want for about b'per half hour) and saw a "documentary" (i use this term loosely)' b'on the conflict in the west bank.' b'' b'it was apparently made with a hand held camcorder (the quality was' b'terrible, and the camera was really jumpy). the documentary (sic)' b'told the tales of all of the children who died in the "war" against' b'the jews as martyrs.' b'' b'it was a regular sob story. one "victimized youth" was recounting' b'on how all he "really" wants to do is to get an education and that' b"the big bad jews won't let him go to high school. he admittedly" b'spent years in prison (age to for murdering a jewish woman' b'but claims that it was "for the cause."' b'' b'i have seen this kind of garbage before. i have a lot of sympathy for' b'the palestinian cause (as do many jews), but i think that even many' b'arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary!' b'' b'the most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end' b'was an address for the makers of the film named jewish comm. on' b'the middle east.' b'' b'anybody heard of them? they make peace now look like right-wingers.' b'' b'' b'gedaliah friedenberg' b'-=-department of mechanical engineering' b'-=-department of metallurgy, mechanics and materials science' b'-=-michigan state university' b'' b'' b''
