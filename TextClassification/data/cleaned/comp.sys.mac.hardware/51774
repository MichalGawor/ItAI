b'' b'' b' i have a (very old) mac 512k and a mac plus, both of which' b' have the same problem.' b' their screens blank out, sometimes after a minor physical jolt' b' (such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive), sometimes' b' all by themselves (computer left to itself just goes blank).' b'' b' i have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the' b' video board, because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires' b' made the screen come back on. this worked for a while, but the' b' blanking out has returned.' b'' b' can i do anything? do i need a new power supply? a new crt?' b' a new computer?' b'' b'i had the same problem with my a long time ago. resoldering' b'the joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it. turns out' b'that continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped)' b'cracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the video' b"circuitry off. if you're not a solder-jockey you might want to" b'have someone else do it i took mine to an electrical engineer' b'buddy but it was a 20-minute job, tops.' b'' b'-kelley-' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------' b'i buy and pay for my own opinions'
