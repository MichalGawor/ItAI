b'' b'a few of us are touring sothwest utah in mid june to see the canyons.\\' b'do any of you have some helpful hints on where to stay or' b'things to see/do/avoid. plans are to see bryce, zion, arches.' b'is the grand close at that point or is an additional trip required?' b'any help would be nice. thank you for your support.' b'' b'spring break, i went through the four corners area and back. the most' b'beautiful stop i made was in utah at the needles overlook. though this' b'is a bit further east than where you appear to be going, i highly' b'recommend it. imho it is far more beautiful than the grand canyon. it' b'was not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of us191 (i was' b'heading north from monticello). in order to get to the right place, i' b'should clarify that it is the needles overlook, and not the recreation' b'area. heading north from monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may' b'have been marked as the anticline overlook. anticline overlook is' b'about (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the needles' b'overlook. the road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably' b'maintained (i ran it about 70mph).' b'' b'looking out from the overlook was like being god and looking down on' b"the world. if it isn't too far out of your way, you should see it." b'' b'' b'dan martin "i can\'t stand this proliferation of paperwork.' b'|' b'| you\'ve got to kill the people producing them."' b'.colorado.edu -vladimir p. kabaidze, soviet plant manager' b''
