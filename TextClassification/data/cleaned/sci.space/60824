b'' b'' b'background: the orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept. it' b'would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.' b"the idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to" b'ten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the main' b'spacecraft. the shock wave from the explosions would transfer' b'momentum to the ship.' b'' b'now, in an atmosphere i can see this. the energy of the explosion' b'heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave' b'into the pusher plate. but in a vacuum, only two things i can see are' b'going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,' b'helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic' b'radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission' b'products).' b'' b"would this work? i can't see the em radiation impelling very much" b'momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems' b"to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs" b'out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once' b"they're there." b'' b'i must be missing something. would someone enlighten me via email?' b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'--' b'--jim' b'' b'---'
