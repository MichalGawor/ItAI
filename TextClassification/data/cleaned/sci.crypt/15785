b'' b'' b' in this giant bally-ho over this clipper chip i noticed a rather' b" disturbing trend in some of the e-mail and posts i've tossing back and" b' forth.' b'' b'me too. a tendency on the part of some people to hide their head in' b'the sand.' b'' b' the reason is very simple: how many people do you want to die in a riot?' b' in a new civil war?' b'' b'how many people do you want jailed for their convictions, for their' b'insistence on real privacy? why sit by quietly while the preconditions' b'for a real civil war are put in place by a short-sighted government.' b'' b" everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and i'm worried" b' that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens' b' and paper.' b'' b'the terminal is mightier than the pen b'' b' can people work within the system before trying to break it? examine your' b' history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to democratic' b" (or democratic style) governments. i think you'll only find one in over" b' five thousand years of written history.' b'' b'really? i guess you mean the u.s. revolution. how about england,' b'india, mexico, france, holland....' b'' b" that's not very good odds." b'' b'you are misinformed. but this whole issue is off the topic.' b'' b' somebody once said something like: "armed violence is meant only to be' b' used in response to an armed attack. it is not meant to be used in' b' agression. this is the difference between self-defence and murder."' b'' b'when the cops kick in your door for using pgp, tell them that. all' b"we're doing here is exercising our (so-called, rapidly narrowing)" b'right to free speech.' b'' b" i'm probably overreacting. but what i've read scared me a lot. i don't" b' want my children growing up in a war zone.' b'' b'perhaps you should talk to the government about that. or are you a' b'disciple of david "the cops are our friends" sternlight?' b'' b'the implied threat of the illegalization of private crypto, the' b'not-so-subtle subtext of the clipper announcement, is what worries me.' b"i don't want my children growing up in a police state." b'' b'-rens' b'' b'**disclaimer: all opinions herein are mine and mine alone, and do not' b'necessarily represent those of any organization with' b'which i may be affiliated.' b'--' b'o===============================================================o' b'| east 49th street, 35th floor phone: b'| new york, new york fax: b'o===============================================================o' b'-- ims is unlikely to share any of the above opinions
