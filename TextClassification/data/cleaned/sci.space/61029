b'' b'' b'' b'some birds require constant management for survival. pointing a sensor at' b'the sun, even when powered down, may burn it out. pointing a' b'parabolic antenna at sol, from venus orbit may trash the' b'foci elements.' b'' b'what i was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be' b'possible to put enough brains on board future deep-space probes' b'for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the' b'sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble.' b'' b'i heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in' b'that essentially says "if you never hear from earth again,' b'here\'s what to do." this was a back up in the event a receiver' b'burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but' b'still some data).' b'' b'even if you let teh bird drift, it may get hosed by some' b'cosmic phenomena.' b'' b'since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for' b'startup, if some type of cosmic bem took out the probe, it might' b"not be such a big loss. obviously you can't plan for" b'everything, but the most obvious things can be considered.' b'' b'' b'| "i know you believe you understand what it is that you b'| think i said. but i am not sure that you realize that b'| what i said is not what i meant."
