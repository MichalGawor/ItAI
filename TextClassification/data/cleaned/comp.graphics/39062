b'' b'writes:' b'perhaphs what bill gates and steve jobs are now is the result of the' b'natural evolution of a "successful" hacker. either you make money, go' b'to jail (lee feldenstein [sp?]), or just fade away as "oh, that\'s uncle' b'so-and-so who *really* likes computers...".' b'' b'what a "computer hacker" is and does will change as long as the definition' b'of the word "computer" continues to change.' b'' b'' b'or perhaps you write a freely available, gpled unix for commonly' b'available computer platforms (i386/i486 machines) and become a catalyst' b'for a major netwide project which produces a better unix-like os than' b'many commercial counterparts (see comp.os.linux for details). or maybe' b'you found a legue for programming freedom to fight restrictive litigation' b'and software patenting practices, thereby protecting the creative freedom' b'so vital to continuing progress in our field. or maybe you start up' b'a gnu project, and produce by far and away the best c/c++ compiler' b'for unix there is, not to mention other valuable utilities.' b'' b'some hackers make significant contributions without selling out their' b'ideals. as for bill gates, after pawning of grossly inferior software' b'onto the pc market for ten years, if he ever was a hacker, he deserves' b'to have his name eradicated from the annals of computer hackery.' b'' b'as for me, i like running linux+x+countless other packages, without' b'paying a dime. on the other hand, i have no problem purchasing motif' b"or other good software, as long as microsoft hasn't fouled it with their" b'inept input.' b'' b'my cents worth, flames will be patiently ignored. b'' b'jean.' b'--' b'jean liddle' b'computer science, illinois state university' b'--------------------------------------------'
