b'' b'i have heard many opinions on this subject and would like to hear more from' b'the people on the net.' b'' b"say you're in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody. you" b'give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in their' b'action anyway and you end up shooting and killing them. my question is' b'what do you do? should you stay and wait for the cops or should you' b"collect your brass (if you're using a semi-auto) and get out of there" b"(provided of course you don't think that you have been seen)? what kind" b'of laws are on the books regarding this type of situation? what would' b'be the most likely thing to happen to you if you stayed and waited and' b'it was a first offense? what would happen if you took off but someone' b'saw you and you were caught?' b'' b'' b'in massachusetts, you will likely be arrested for murder, but' b'if you convince the cops/da that you used lethal force because' b'of threat of death or serious bodily harm, then the charges' b'would probably be dropped. if you run away and are later caught,' b'then you will have a much harder time convincing cops/judge/jury' b'of your innocence. going "on the lam" is seen as an indication' b'of guilt by a lot of people.' b'' b'--' b'jim lacey my own opinions' b"d'ou venons-nous? que sommes-nous? ou allons-nous?"
