b'' b'' b'on the 78th commemorative anniversary of the turkish genocide of the armenians,' b'we remember those whose only crime was to be armenian in the shadow of an' b'emerging turkish proto-fascist state. in their names we demand justice.' b'' b'in april the turkish government began a systematically executed' b'de-population of the eastern anatolian homeland of the armenians through a' b'genocidal extermination. this genocide was to insure that turks exclusively' b'ruled over the geographic area today called the republic of turkey. the' b'result: million murdered, billion dollars of armenian property stolen' b'and plundered. this genocide ended nearly years of armenian civilization' b'on those lands. today, the turkish government continues to scrape clean any' b"vestige of a prior armenian existence on those lands. today's turkish" b'governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture' b'distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the armenian people. in' b'the face of refutation ad nauseam, the turkish historical society and cronies' b'shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. this policy' b'merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state' b'policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. a crime unpunished is a' b'crime encouraged. adolf hitler took this cue less than years after the' b'successful genocide of the armenians.' b'' b'[ b'' b'armenians demand justice ermeniler adalet istiyor' b'' b'--' b's.d.p.a. center for regional studies anatolia and has forgotten the' b'p.o. box punishment inflicted on it." b'cambridge, ma late turkish president turgut ozal' b'to which i say:' b'hear, hear. motion seconded.' b'' b'hovig' b'' b'' b'--' b'hovig heghinian' b'university of illinois at urbana-champaign' b'department of computer science'
