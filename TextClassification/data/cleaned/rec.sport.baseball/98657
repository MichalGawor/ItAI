b'' b'i heard that eli is selling the team to a group in cinninati. this would' b"help so that the o's could make some real free agent signings in the" b'offseason. training camp reports that everything is pretty positive right' b'now. the backup catcher postion will be a showdown between tackett and parent' b'although i would prefer parent. draft pick jeff hammonds may be coming' b"up faster in the o's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. mike" b'flanagan is trying for another comeback. big ben is being defended by' b'coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came' b'in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. this' b"may be ben's year." b"i feel that while this may not be mussina's cy young year, he will" b'be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year' b"around august. i really hope baines can provide the rf support the o's need." b'orsulak was decent but i had hoped that chito martinez could learn defense' b"better and play like he did in the o's right now don't have many" b"left-handed hitters. anderson proving last year was no fluke and cal's return" b'to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. the' b'rotation should be sutcliffe, mussina, mcdonald, rhodes, olson is an' b'interesting case. will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get' b'three pop outs? you never know.' b'the way i see the al east this year (with personal biases mixed in)' b'baltimore' b'new york' b'toronto' b'milwaukee' b'cleveland' b'boston' b'detroit' b'(the top are the only true contenders in my mind. one of these will' b'definitely win the division unless it snows in hell/maryland i feel' b"that this baltimore's season to finally put everything together.)" b'__________________________________________________________________________' b'|"committee for the liberation and intergration of terrifying organisms b'|and their rehabilitation into society" from red dwarf "polymorph" b'|****the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed!****|' b'| this sig has been brought to you by... frungy! the sport of kings! b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' b''
