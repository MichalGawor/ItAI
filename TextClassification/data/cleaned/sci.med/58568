b'==============' b"using a pc's keyboard on your workstation compatibility issues" b'' b'mini outline:' b'1. spoofing a keyboard over the serial port' b'2. x terminals' b'3. next' b'4. silicon graphics' b'5. ibm rs/6000' b'6. other stuff' b'' b'1. spoofing a keyboard over the serial port' b'' b"if you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard" b"(sun, hp, dec, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding" b'a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard. if your workstation' b"runs the x window system, you're in luck. you can buy a cheap used" b'pc, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable' b'to your workstation. then, run a program on the workstation to read' b'the serial port and generate fake x keyboard events.' b'' b"the two main programs i've found to do this are kt and a2x." b'' b'a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and' b'even moving among widgets on the screen. it requires a server' b'extension (xtest, dec-xtrap, or xtestextension1). to find out if your' b"server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings" b"appear in the extensions list. if your server doesn't have this," b'you may want to investigate compiling x11r5, patchlevel or later,' b'or bugging your vendor.' b'' b'kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended x servers.' b"another program called xsendevent also exists, but i haven't seen it." b'' b'both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.' b'' b'2. x terminals' b'' b'also, a number of x terminals (ncd, tektronics, to name a few) use' b'pc-compatible keyboards. if you have an x terminal, you may be all' b'set. try it out with a normal pc keyboard before you go through the' b'trouble of buying an alternative keyboard. also, some x terminals add' b'extra buttons you may need to keep your original keyboard around' b'for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the setup key.' b'' b'3. next' b'' b'next had announced that new next machines will use the apple desktop' b'bus, meaning any mac keyboard will work. then, they announced they' b'were cancelling their hardware production. if you want any kind of' b'upgrade for an older next, do it now!' b'' b'4. silicon graphics' b'' b'silicon graphics has announced that their newer machines (indigo^2 and' b"beyond) will use standard pc-compatible keyboards and mice. i don't" b"believe this also applies to the power series machines. it's not" b'possible to upgrade an older sgi to use pc keyboards, except by' b'upgrading the entire machine. contact your sgi sales rep for more' b'details.' b'' b'5. ibm rs/6000' b'' b'ibm rs/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal pc keyboards. b"unfortunately, you can't just plug one in. you need two things: a b'cable converter to go from the large pc keyboard connector to the b'smaller ps/2 style din-6, and a new device driver for aix. believe b'it or not, ibm wrote this device driver recently, i used it, and it b"works. however, they don't want me to redistribute it. i've been b'told judy hume is a potential contact. if you learn b'anything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t b'' b'6. other stuff' b'' b'some vendors here (notably: health care keyboard co. and accucorp)' b'support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your' b'queries regarding supporting your own weird computer. if you can' b'get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either' b'from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in' b'luck. contact the companies for more details.' b'' b'' b'apple adjustable keyboard' b'apple computer, inc.' b'sales offices all over the place.' b'' b'availability: february, b'price: b'supports: mac only' b'' b'apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard. the' b'keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate' b'backward on a hinge. the sections do not tilt upward. the keys are' b'arranged in a normal qwerty fashion.' b'' b'the main foldable keyboard resembles a normal apple keyboard.' b'a separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.' b'' b'the keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not' b'directly attachable to the keyboard.' b'' b"as soon as soda comes back up, i'll have a detailed blurb from" b'tidbits available there.' b'' b''

b"keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at comdex. it's" b'another split-design. one thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both' b'the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.' b'the arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key pc keyboard.' b'' b'keytronic makes standard pc keyboards, also, so this product will' b'probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.' b'' b'' b'dragondictate-30k (and numerous other dragon products)' b'dragon systems, inc.' b'320 nevada street' b'newton, ma b'' b'phone: 800-talk-typ or b'fax: b'' b'shipping:

products.' b"most (if not all) of them seem to run on pc's and compatibles" b"(including ps/2's and other microchannel boxes). they sell you" b'a hardware board and software which sits in front of a
