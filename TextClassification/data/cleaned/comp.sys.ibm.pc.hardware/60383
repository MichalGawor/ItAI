b'' b'since the mac uses only scsi-1 for hard drives yes the "figure includes a' b'hundred for scsi drivers" this is sloppy people and dumb.' b'' b'what group is this? this is not a mac group.' b'' b'ok once again with the scsi spec list:' b'' b'why the spec list again? we are talking scsi on a pc, not on a mac or' b'a unix box. and we are talking isa bus, or possibly eisa or vlb.' b'' b"this isin't comp.periphs.scsi." b'tell me what the performance figures are with a single scsi drive on a pc' b'with an isa (or eisa or vlb) bus.' b'' b'theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this' b"debate. i'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can" b"handle the megs/sec of scsi xyz wide'n'fast, but the pc isin't one of" b'them.' b'' b'if we are to continue this thread state clearly which scsi you are talking' b'about scsi-1 or scsi-2 or scsi over all {scsi-1 and scsi-2}' b'it does make a difference.' b'' b'well maybe if the scsi design people had their act together than maybe' b"all pc's would have built in scsi ports by now."
