b'' b'question:' b'what is the exact entry (parameter and syntax please), in the x-terminal' b'configuration file (loaded when the x-terminal boots), to add another system' b'to the tcp/ip access control list?' b'' b'background:' b"i have two unix systems, an at&t 3b2 running x11r3 and mit's x11r4 and" b'2. a sun ss10 without any x.' b'i want to have a window to the sun and the 3b2 on the ncd x-terminal at the' b'same time. i can do this if i manually set the network parameter tcp/ip' b'access control list to off, then login to my telnet session. not great!' b'i\'ve tried to get "xhost" to work and failed. either my syntax is wrong' b'or the x11r3 implementation is bogus.' b'i am trying to edit the ncd configuration file that is loaded when the' b'ncd boots. no matter what entry i add or edit, the ncd still boots with' b'the tcp/ip access control list containing only the 3b2.' b'my manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!! thanks!' b''
