b'' b'| my mom passed along a lengthy review she clipped regarding robin lane' b"| fox's book _the unauthorized version: truth and fiction in the bible_," b'|...' b"| i've read the book. some parts were quite typical regarding its" b'| criticism of the bible as an inaccurate historical document,' b'| alt.altheism, etc carries typical responses, but not as vociferous as' b'| a.a. it does give an insight into how these historian (is he one... i' b"| don't have any biodata on him) work. i've not been able to understand/" b'| appreciate some of the arguments, something like, it mentions certain' b'| events, so it has to be after that event, and so on.' b'' b'robin lane fox is a historian and a gardener. he has written several' b'history books, perhaps a recent one you might remember is "the search' b'for alexander". he has also written or edited several books on' b'gardening.' b'--'
