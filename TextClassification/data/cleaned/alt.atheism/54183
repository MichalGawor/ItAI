b'' b' simple. take out some physics books, and start looking for statements which' b' say that there is no objective physics. i doubt you will find any. you' b' might find statements that there is no objective length, or no objective' b' location, but no objective _physics_?' b'' b'perhaps you have a different understanding of what "physics" is. if we' b"can't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics" b"aren't objective either. that's what i mean when i say there's no objective" b'physics.' b'' b"sure, we can all agree that (say) f gmm/r^2, but that's maths. it's only" b"physics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can't do that" b"objectively, we're stuck. (of course, this displays my blatant bias towards" b'applied science; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real' b'world situations, based on real world observations.)' b'' b' (consider, for instance, that speed-of-light-in-' b' vacuum is invariant. this sounds an awful lot like an objective' b' speed-of-light-in-vacuum.)' b'' b"it's an axiom that it's invariant. but if the two of us measure it, we'll" b"get different answers. yes, we call that experimental error, but it's not" b'really "error" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don\'t get any,' b"that's an error b'' b'you could argue that the value of c is "objective, to within <some' b'value". but i\'d call that a rather odd usage of the word "objective", and' b'it opens the way for statements like "murder is objectively wrong for all' b'people, to within of the total population."' b'' b'' b'mathew'
