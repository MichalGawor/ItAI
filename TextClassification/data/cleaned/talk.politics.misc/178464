b'' b'' b'i am so tired about all this debate on how many gays there' b'are! such arguments are basically worthless, imho. would it' b'really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly' b'denied access to housing, employment, and personal security or' b'even only one?' b'as for death threats, i happen to know from personal' b'experience that gay people are far more likely to receive' b'them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies' b'related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex' b'uals. not a week goes by that i personally or one of my friends' b'is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to' b'be gay.' b'everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under' b'our current form of government in theory, yet every day' b'gay people are victimized by their local governments, by' b'the police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformed' b"and ignorant public. is this democracy? i don't think so." b"a society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of" b'the treatment of the people who make up that society.' b'all of those people. and yes, that includes gays, lesbians,' b'and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and who' b'are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are' b'a part.' b'--' b'frank jordan \x1b[d\x1b[d\x1b[d\x1b\x1b[c\x1b[c\x1b[c' b'gay arab bassoonists unite!!!' b''
