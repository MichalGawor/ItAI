b'' b'just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (ap, etc.) that' b'there were several witnesses to bd folks starting the fires. it has also' b'been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which' b'rules out a bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.' b'' b'the only folks claiming this are the atf/fbi who have an interest in' b"putting the blame on the bd's. wake up." b'' b'' b'what i would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident. i' b'believe the moves made were right and proper, but i still have some problems' b'with some of the tactics. after watching the abc special on it tonight, as' b'well as cnn and nightline, i question some of the atf and fbi actions.' b'' b'right and proper? how? it was fubar from day b'' b'1) could it have been possible to have taken koresh outside the compound at' b'some time before the feb. 28th raid?' b'' b'from all independent sources. yes.' b'' b'2) could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.' b'' b'it would have hurt nothing to wait and the result could hardly have been' b'worse.' b'' b'3) were fbi actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action?' b'' b'sure, it you want to someone you claim is a dangerous paranoid even' b'more paranoid.' b'' b'and a few other questions. like i said, i believe the actions taken, in' b'general, were proper. but i still have some reservations.' b'' b"one other point, i'm no fan of janet reno, but i do like the way she had the" b'"balls" to go ahead and take full responsibility. seems like the waffle boy' b'had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.' b'' b'and what makes you think that "waffle boy" didn\'t tell her to take the' b'wrap. it was job preservation not "balls".' b'--' b'|*clinton*gore*cia*fbi*dea*assassinate*bomb*wod*bor*atf*irs*resist*nsa* b'|*christian*god*satan*apocalypse*zog*nazi*socialist*communist*explosive*|' b'+*fundamentalist*revolution*nsc*federal reserve*constitution*gold*fema*
