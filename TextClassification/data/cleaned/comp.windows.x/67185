b'' b'i consider twm-style squeezed titles indispensable in a window' b'manager. i like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same' b"time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, i have" b'other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.' b'' b"in case you're not familiar with squeezed titles, here's a crude" b'picture:' b'' b'====================== figure b'|' b'| b'| title a title b title c b'| b'| this is the window b hides window c, but b"| body of the you can still see c's title b'| window, window a which is squeezed right. b'| b'|' b'====================== figure b'' b'squeezed titles allow me to have about such windows in each stack,' b'with easy access; and per stack is usually more than i really' b'need, since i also insist on having a virtual wm.' b'' b'the only problem is that the title location is static, that is, it' b'is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit' b'that file and restart the window manager. doing so is cumbersome and' b'time-consuming.' b'' b'therefore, i have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right b'functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click' b'of a button, you can change this:' b'' b'+---------+' b'+ title a b'+------------------------+' b'+ this is the b'+ body of the b'+ window, window a b'+------------------------+' b'' b'to this:' b'' b'+---------+' b'+ title a b'+------------------------+' b'+ this is the b'+ body of the b'+ window, window a b'+------------------------+' b'' b'===============' b'' b'okay. so far, so good. now, how the heck do i get them to put this' b'into the next "official" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm,' b'and the next ctwm? and the next xyztwm that i never heard of?' b'' b'one way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this' b'enhancement, together with an explanation of why i think it is a' b'very good thing, and hope that someone reads it. b'' b"in case it isn't already clear why i think it's a very good thing," b'look back up at figure and picture window a moved over on top of' b"windows b and c; now window a's title hides window b's title;" b'but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:' b'' b'+=========+ b'+ title b title a title c b'+-------------------------------------+' b'+ this is the body of the window, b'+ window a, which is on top. b'+-------------------------------------+' b'' b'===================' b'' b'the rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my' b"x11r4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the" b'full diffs would be too long.' b'' b'the key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the' b'executefunction() routine in menus.c:' b'' b'#ifdef shape' b'case f_squeezeleft:' b'{\tstatic squeezeinfo left_squeeze j_left, b'if (deferexecution (context, func, scr-selectcursor))' b'return true;' b'' b'tmp_win-squeeze_info &left_squeeze;' b'setframeshape( tmp_win b'break;' b'}' b'.... and similarly for squeezeright j_right and' b'squeezecenter j_center b'#endif' b'' b'( of course, you also have to define f_squeezeleft in parse.h' b'and add' b'{ "f.squeezeleft", fkeyword, f_squeezeleft b'... and so forth b'to parse.c' b'' b'in order to use these functions, add something like the' b'following to your .twmrc file:' b'' b'button2 m s w|v|d|r|i|t|door f.squeezecenter' b'' b'=================' b'' b'about a year ago, i posted this, but our news was broken and i' b"*think* it didn't get out." b'' b'since then, "blast" has appeared in comp.sources.x, volume b'issue you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by' b'chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. better to have a' b'twm-style window manager, i think.' b'' b'--' b'ralph betza (fm),' b'' b'"the question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting' b'than the question of whether a submarine can think" lenny dykstra'
