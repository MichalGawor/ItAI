b'' b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i have a 486sx25 isa machine with pheonix bios. currently i have' b'8 megabytes of ram installed via eight mg simms on the motherboard: ie.' b'both banks are full, and there is no space for more simms. i am thinking' b'of running os2 on my machine and possibly linux with x windows, and i know' b'that more ram would be helpful. however with simms, the only solution i' b'can see is to sell my megs for about and by 4mg simms for about' b"$400 used. apart from the fact that i can't afford the price right now," b'the entire process of selling ram and buying it used probably means that' b'the machine might be down for a number of days which i would rather' b'avoid...' b'' b'so my question is, do the at ram boards that plug into a free slot work' b'well with a isa machine. i have seen some being sold used for about' b"$90 with mg with space for another 4mg's. if these boards do work, how" b'do they do it? is a device driver needed, or will the bios pickup the' b'extra ram as it does with the simms on the mother board? i know that the' b'isa expansions slots are 16-bits and simm memory is bits, so' b'probably all of this is just wishful thinking... however any help is truly' b'appreciated.' b'' b'-eric' b'' b''
