b'' b': however greatly we extoll mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no' b': way god or even part of god or equal to god. the assumption of our' b': blessed mother, meant that because of her close identification with the' b': redemptive work of christ, she was assumed (note that she did not' b': ascend) body and soul into heaven, and is thus one of the few, along' b': with elijah, enoch, moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in' b': heaven. obviously, the virgin mary is far superior in glorification to' b': any of the previously mentioned personages.' b'' b'' b'as i said, it is a provocative thought.' b'' b'from "answer to job":' b'' b'the logical consistency of the papal declaration cannot be surpassed' b'and it leaves protestantism with the odium of being nothing but a' b"_man's religion_ which allows no metaphysical representation of woman." b'...protestantism has obviously not given sufficient attention to the' b'signs of the times which point to the equality of women. but this' b'equality requires to be metaphysically anchored in the figure of a' b'"divine" woman, the bride of christ. just as the person of christ' b'cannot be replaced by an organization, so the bride cannot be re-' b'placed by the church. the feminine, like the masculine, demands an' b'equally personal representation.' b'the dogmatizing of the assumption does not, however, according' b'to the dogmatic view, mean that mary has attained the status of a' b'goddess, although, as mistress of heaven...and mediatrix, she is' b'functionally on a par with christ, the king and mediator. at any' b'rate, her position satisfies the need of the archetype.
