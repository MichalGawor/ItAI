b'' b' o.k., so pick former yugoslavia instead and say their problems are caused' b" by communism, it doesn't really matter. but i guess religious leaders are" b" calling for an end to that, too, so it can't be religiously motivated. this" b' despite the fact that the christians carve crosses in dead muslims chests.' b' maybe they just want land. maybe its something else they want. maybe the' b" cross carvings are just accidental. i don't know. just looks suspicious." b'' b'most likely the tragic situation in bosnia is a combination of ethnical' b'and religious motives, where religion is just one attribute that separates' b'the groups from each other.' b'' b'but i must agree that the sad saga in bosnia is a terrible example' b'of a case where religion is not helping, instead it is used as a weapon' b'against other humans. and my sympathies are mostly on the bosnian side,' b'it looks like the serbs are the oppressors, willing to use even' b'christianity as a weapon against their former friends.' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
