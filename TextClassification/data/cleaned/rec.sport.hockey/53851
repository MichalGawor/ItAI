b'' b'' b'i was wtahcing right guard hockey week on tsn yesterday and they had' b'a feature on this guy that does a lot (most?) of the masks for nhl' b'goalies. they talked about how they are made, what they are made of,' b'and the designs that are put on them, etc.' b'' b'the best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.' b'it has the current leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking' b'black panther on the forehead it *has* to be a new mask for felix' b'potvin, but he never said whose it was.' b'' b' are you sure this program was current? i know that grant fuhr' b' had a black panther on the forehead of his mask when he played with' b' the leafs.' b'' b'it would seem logical that the mask is potvins. his nickname is "the cat",' b'which would go a long ways towards explaining the panther.' b'' b'of course, it could be an old story and the mask is fuhrs, too.....' b'' b'alan' b''
