b'' b'clayton cramer writes:' b'#compared to the table i have already posted from masters, johnson,' b'#and kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that' b'#homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general' b'#male population.' b'' b'did you ever consider the selection effect that those who are willing' b'to admit to being a member sexual minority (homosexuality) are more' b'willing to admit to being a member of another sexual minority (highly' b'promiscious)?' b'' b"i didn't think that you did." b'' b'--' b'-greg hennessy, university of virginia' b'' b"it is obvious that mr. cramer has the 'ability' to take the 'leap of faith'." b'i have listened to several of the men involved in this study, and even they' b"claim that the men involved will not 'tell the whole truth'." b'' b"i put little value in extrapolating from these types of 'studies' or 'surveys'," b'they have limited subsets of individuals, and there is alot of skewing due' b'to improper selection methods, and the bias of the people involved in the' b'studies on both sides- subject and researcher.' b'' b'would you admit to be part of a group that was not very well liked? would' b'you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormal' b'rate (this applies to heterosexual men). in fact, as one gay man and one' b'straight man put it, "men lie about the number of partners, because that\'s' b'the thing to do"- our culture for the male almost requires this type of' b'response. it may seem harmless and silly, but carries a large emotional' b'and mental price tag.' b'' b"i hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed'" b'conquest. they just have to look good to one another, at least in their' b'eyes. but also know that alot of this does go on, there are many college' b'males (hetero) having a lot of sex with different partners.'
