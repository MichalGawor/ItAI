b'' b'how do you do bus-mastering on the isa bus?' b'' b'by initiating a dma xfer. b'' b"seriously, busmastering adapter have their own dma ability, they don't use" b'the motherboards on-board dma(which is *much* slower).' b'' b'isa has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in isa system' b'try to do dma xfers on the same dma channel the system will lock or' b'crash.(i forget)' b'' b'their are dma channels in an isa system. are 8-bit are' b'16-bit.' b'' b'the system uses dma a soundblaster uses dma b'' b'i could buy a busmastering xga-2 video card a busmastering scsi ha.' b'' b'in order for them to work properly, i would have to find out what dma' b'channel the xga-2 card uses and then simply configure the scsi ha to' b'use a different dma channel for its dma xfers.' b'' b"i don't know if multiple dma xfers can go on at the same time on isa." b"i'm not sure if they can on eisa systems either." b'' b'i do know that on eisa/mca systems, you can allow bm cards to use the' b'same dma channel.' b'' b'thanks.' b''
