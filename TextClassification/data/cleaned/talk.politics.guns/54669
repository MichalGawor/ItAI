b'' b"or the cultists...) i think i'll quote the bbc quoting (actually voice" b'interview) one of the two british survivors. he claimed that the fire' b'started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall/roof to collapse' b'knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan.' b'' b'\tif the fbi started the fire, why didn`t people flee the' b'burning building?' b'' b'assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about' b'by the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good)' b"perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant entering the" b'fire from the other side? like they were surrounded by the fire, and' b'rubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses)' b'overcame and enveloped them?' b'' b'in other words they were trapped by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?' b'' b'does that sound plausable? not as dramatic as korash forcing them to' b'stay, or shooting them (no shot victims found yet), but plausable...' b'' b'--' b'if all else fails, try: ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat' b'wisdom: "only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,' b'and i am not sure about the former." albert einstien'
