b'' b'responds to a lot of grief given to him' b'a.k.a. "the sagemaster"' b'[ b'but then i ask, so? where is this relevant to my discussion in' b"answering john's question of why? why are there genetic diseases," b'and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require' b"babies to develop antibodies. is it god's fault? (the original" b'question) i say no, it is not.' b'' b"most of scotty's followup *was* irrelevant to the original question," b'but this is not unusual, as threads often quickly evolve away from' b'the original topic. what i could not understand is why jim spent so' b'much time responding to what he regarded as irrelevancies.' b'' b'[ b" may i ask, where is this 'collective' bullcrap coming from?" b'[ b'' b'by "collective" i was referring to the idea that god works with' b'humanity on two levels, individually and collectively. if mankind' b'as a whole decides to undertake a certain action (the majority of' b'mankind),' b'' b'well, i guess hypothetical adam was "the majority of mankind"' b'seeing how he was the only man at the time.' b'' b'then god will allow the consequences of that action to' b"affect mankind as a whole. if you didn't understand that, then i" b'apologize for not using one and two syllable words in my discussion.' b'' b'i understand what you mean by "collective," but i think it is an' b'insane perversion of justice. what sort of judge would punish the' b'descendants for a crime committed by their ancestor?' b'' b'if you want to be sure that i read your post and to provide a' b'a.a. every day, and some posts slip by. thanks.' b'' b'well, i must admit that you probably read a.a. more often than i read' b'the bible these days. but you missed a couple of good followups to' b"your post. i'm sending you a personal copy of my followup which i" b'hope you will respond to publically in a.a.' b'' b'john' b'the sageless'
