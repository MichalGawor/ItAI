b'' b'' b'mark singer brings up the strawberry incident, where he lost a homerun' b'and the fan caught it.' b'' b'| before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech' b'| wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that' b'| are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any' b'| that are in the field of play. was the fan wrong? should he have' b'| been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility' b'| of interference?' b'' b'yes, i think he should have done more to get out of the way. as much' b'as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning' b'the game is more important. as a dodger fan, he has to be aware that' b'this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win' b'in any way possible. as soon as the ball was hit that far, his first' b'instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it, not to try to catch' b'it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.' b'' b'i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans, where they are against' b'visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the' b'field.' b'' b'now, this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or' b'not. sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his' b'first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.' b'' b'' b'daniel' b''
