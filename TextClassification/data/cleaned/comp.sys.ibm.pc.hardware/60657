b'' b" what's the difference between loading mouse.com in autoexec.bat and" b' doing device=mouse.sys in config.sys??' b'' b'the only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be' b'loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com' b'will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.' b'' b' which one is better?' b'' b'mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it' b'could perhaps be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it.' b'the working of both drivers is totally the same.' b'' b'when i ran dos, i preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,' b"because some programs won't run with some drivers and i could choose the" b'ones i needed during startup. but with drdos6, this advantage is gone,' b'because drdos lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.' b'' b'michael' b'--' b'* germany neuss voice:
