b'' b'i need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to' b'deliver joules at volts... the ubiquitous' b'camera flash circuit is what i want, but i cant get mine apart without' b'breaking it...' b'' b"charlie brett's suggestion buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use" b'the film, then take the thing apart is a good one. note, though, that' b"you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it" b"may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation." b'' b'the things are easy to dismantle. the key piece of information is that' b'when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the' b'film cassette it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when' b"the camera is made. so no darkroom is needed for dismantling. it's" b'standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.' b'' b'all the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables' b'is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,' b'and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in' b'another. if you take it apart yourself, you get an aa alkaline battery' b'(still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and' b'pieces from the camera.' b'' b'i expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really' b'determined.' b'--'
