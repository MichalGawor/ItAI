b'' b" i'm considering modernizing some old wiring in my home, and" b' i need a little advice on outlet wiring. several outlets' b" are the old 'two prong' type, without the ground. naturally," b' the wire feeding these outlets is without the ground' b' wire. i noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the' b' with ground, and that on these circuits, the ground' b' wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral (white) wire.' b'' b'they are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,' b'repeat nowhere, else. (well, almost. there are strange exceptions for things' b'like sub-panels.)' b'' b'' b'\t--- jamie hanrahan, kernel mode systems, san diego ca' b'' b'' b'not even in sub panels! the only place the neutral should be connected to the' b'ground is in a service disconnect! in your house the "main" panel serves as' b'the service disconnect. sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must' b'maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not service' b'disconnect equipment.' b'' b'' b'steve woodard, kd2kq not a licensed electrician, but i can read the nec book.' b'(my brother is though) b''
