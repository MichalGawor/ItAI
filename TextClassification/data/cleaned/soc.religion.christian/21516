b'' b'' b' i have a question about satan. i was taught a long time ago' b'that satan was really an angel of god and was kicked out of heaven' b"because he challenged god's authority. the problem is, i cannot" b'find this in the bible. is it in the bible? if not, where did it' b'originate?' b'' b'\tthe quick answer: revelation b'' b'' b'and as someone mentioned earlier, from the apocryphal book of enoch,' b'satan was apparently kicked out for three times asserting his own will,' b'"i will". hmmm...pro-choice looks kinda creepy here.' b'' b'then there are the references around the bible about taking a third' b'of the angels, getting a third of the heavens or something.'
