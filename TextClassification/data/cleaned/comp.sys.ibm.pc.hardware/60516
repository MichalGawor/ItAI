b'' b'' b"what's the word on the chipset? is this a rom bug specific" b'to a specific brand using the rockwell, or is it the rockwell' b'chipset itself?' b'' b'there were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much' b'expected with any fax/modem talking with a different fax or modem' b"which may have also been revised or is new. i'm pretty much" b"oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it" b'from someone else.' b'' b'someone else, could you please comment on that. i have just bought' b"a twincom 14.4dfi, which has a rockwell chipset. it wasn't cheap" b"so i would like to hear of problems i'm likely to run into." b'' b'however, i can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the' b'rockwell mpu (as opposed to the dpu) for an internal implementation.' b'this is because the mpu used "speed buffering" instead of having a' b'16550 interface. without the interface, the number of interrupts' b'are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking' b'conditions (like in windows). as far as i know, the "speed buffering"' b'works ok for external modems if a is used on the internal serial' b'port board.' b'' b'phew, i was lucky! the twincom internal version has a 550a and one' b'of the rockwell chips is marked rc144dp.' b'' b'but still i would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware' b'problems.' b'' b'niels'
