b'' b'' b'some folks like to argue about theoretical details. i prefer to watch teams' b'win. when the giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange' b"the batting order. until then, i think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong," b"for the simple fact that it's working as it is." b'' b'this is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division.' b'but the giants are going to need every break they can get, if they' b"want too hold that lead. i don't think they can afford to be" b'lackadaisical, and say "well it has worked pretty well so far, and' b"while we might be able to improve the results, we don't think it is" b'worth the risk".' b'' b'mostly, though, the giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that' b"continues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. but evidently," b'some folks would rather be right than be first.' b'' b'the two tend to go hand in hand...' b'' b'cheers,' b'-valentine'
