(i use 3dbench).' b'my winmark was million, i think.' b'' b"so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully" b'can perform approx same w/ my current vram in windows and also' b"can perform dos' vga preferably 30fps." b'' b'i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it' b'in csipg and it looked that speedstar 24x and orchid prodesigner 2d-s' b'ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard.' b"both can give 30fps in dos' vga w/ 486dx2/66." b'does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor' b'type which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)?' b'any other card recommendation is welcomed too.' b'' b"also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? b'' b'thanks in advance, folks!' b'' b'===martin'
