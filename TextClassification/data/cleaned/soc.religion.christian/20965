b'' b'' b' one of my questions i would' b' like to ask is can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological' b' works intended for a lay person?' b'' b'' b'i would recommend "essential truthes of the christian faith" by rc sproul.' b'it is copywrited from tyndale house publishers. sproul offers concise' b'explanations, in simple language, of around different christian' b'doctrines, grouped by subject. i think it would be particularly good for' b'newer christians (and older christians suffering spiritual malnutrition),' b'as it gives a biblically sound basic treatment of the issues, avoiding' b'long in-depth analysis that can wait until after you know the basics.' b'' b'---' b'dave weaver "he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to'
