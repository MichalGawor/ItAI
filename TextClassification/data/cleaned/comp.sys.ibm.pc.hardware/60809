b'' b'| what a weekend... i replaced my motherboard, upgraded to dos ms' b'| windows and now experience lockups in any windows application using the' b'| modem.' b'|' b'| 386dx/dxl-40 cpu (amd?)' b'| ami bios' b'| i/o card with serial, parallel and game ports (generic cheapo)' b'| ide controller (two hd, two fd)' b'| internal packard bell modem' b'| mouse' b'|' b'| the mouse is set to com1, irq4 (via jumper on the i/o board and parms on the' b'| mouse driver). the modem is set to com2, irq3 (jumpers on modem board). in' b'| addition, i think i have disabled the second serial port on the i/o card since' b'| it is unused. mouse works fine.' b'|' b"| here's the deal: procomm dos version works fine through the modem." b'| procomm for windows, (cim) compuserve for windows, and' b'| terminal all lockup when i try to do anything with the' b'| modem. the screen just freezes, no sound comes from the' b'| modem, nor any messages on the screen.' b'|' b"| i'm getting real frustrated. could the second port on the i/o card still be" b"| enabled? would this cause a problem? i've been through most of the software" b"| routes, so i'm beggining to believe that maybe this is a hardware problem." b'| anybody been through a similar experience? anybody have any ideas i could try??' b'| please???' b'|' b'| thanks in advance....' b'|' b'| n a stassen lantz' b'' b'i ran into the same problem when i upgraded from a modem to a b'modem. any time i give the modem a reset command [atz] while, in windows.' b'the computer locks up. if i give the atz command in dos, it will work. my solution' b'was to not give the modem the [atz] command thru windows. in the procomm b'install process i told the program i have a hayes compatible modem. atz' b'was not included in the initialization string it works fine. i called ms' b"about this, they didn't have a clue as to what the memory/interupt conflict" b'could be. the lockup accures using any windows comm program that gives the atz' b'command.'
