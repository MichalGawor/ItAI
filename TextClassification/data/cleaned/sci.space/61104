b'' b"ah, there's the rub. and a catch-22 to boot. for the purposes of a" b"contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get" b'there. and although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without' b'demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system...' b'' b"you're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate" b'project. but why? if you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars' b'in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop' b'your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against' b'your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers. no' b'other demand is necessary.' b'' b' any plan for doing' b' sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting' b' money in a big way.' b'' b'this depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line. in other' b'words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,' b'navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system.' b"you wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but i'd hate to see" b'folks waiting to do anything until a low cost mac, oops, i mean launch' b'system comes on line.' b'' b"you're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch" b'system. but why? the saturn v took less than six years, depending on' b'exactly when you date its start. pegasus took about three from project' b'start to first flight. before sdio chickened out on orbital development,' b'the target date for an orbital dc-y flight was if you really want' b'speed, consider that the first prototypes of the thor missile (still in' b'service as the core of the delta launcher) shipped to the usaf less' b'than months after the development go-ahead.' b'' b'one of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief' b"that you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending" b"billions of dollars. it isn't true and never was."
