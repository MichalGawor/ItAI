b'' b'' b' b" \ti realize i'm entering this discussion rather late, but i do" b" have one question. wasn't it a reagan appointee, james watt, a" b' pentacostal christian (i think) who was the secretary of the interior' b' who saw no problem with deforestation since we were "living in the' b' last days" and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods' b' anyway?' b'' b' i heard the same thing, but without confirmation that he actually said it.' b' it was just as alarming to us as to you; the bible says that nobody knows' b' when the second coming will take place.' b'' b' b' michael a. covington' b'' b'i do recall watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few' b"years back and i can't cite the specifics. i also recall that cecil andrus, who" b'was secretary of the interior during the carter administration, responded' b"to watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that god gave" b'to man, as recorded in genesis. which makes me wonder: who are the' b'true conservatives? it seems to me that a *conservative* should want to' b'*conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit. this form of' b'*conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in' b'which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate' b'to one another and to god.' b'' b"imho, watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served" b"on the board of directors for jim bakker's organization, during a time in" b'which bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed bakker' b'in federal prison.' b'' b'bob' b'just another baptist...'
