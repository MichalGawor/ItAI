b'' b"you're right." b'' b'you cannot read or write a mac or apple ii 800k disk or apple ii' b'5.25" disk without extra hardware. however, mac 1.44mb disks can be read' b'and written in a pc hd drive with software only.' b'' b'this should probably be added to every pc and mac faq file. it sure gets' b'asked enough.' b'' b'i agree that this should be added to some sort of faq list. but we have' b'strayed from the original topic. our computer environment is pretty split' b"between mac's and pc's... i am lucky and get to have both on my desk. but" b"there are people who have pc's and need to share data with the mac users" b'here. the mac users have no problems because of package called dos mounter' b'which automatically lets the mac read dos disks natively. for the pc there' b'is no equivilant... that i know of! both mac-ette and macsee have been' b'inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity' b'in a dos program to selectively transport the files.' b'' b'the question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into' b'windows like a .dll that will interpret the reading of a mac disk when it is' b'in a pc, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs. it is quite' b'clear that this would only be available for the 1.44mb flopies.' b'' b'' b'-- t.j. fiske' b''
