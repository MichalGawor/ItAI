b'' b'' b"i've come to learn to suspect anything in the american press about" b'our "system". if much or some of it were true, you\'d have to take' b'us for idiots for tolerating it. and given that our insurance was' b'installed during a period when there were only liberal and tory' b'governments federally and provincially, and the socialists are still' b"chafing, they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix" b'things think about it. after all, we are using the u.s. as a' b'metric to make comparison both for keeping-up-with-the-joneses' b'as for confirming that we did something right.' b'' b'true, but remember that most of the canadian-bashing exists because american' b"proponents of your system make it look like it walks on water. even you don't" b'go that far.' b'' b"sorry, but i'd have to differ. the canadian-bashing wrt to the health" b'insurance system is largely with little evidence or prompting. having' b'kept up with this debate on the net for some months, just about all the' b'criticism of the canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even' b'the anti-canadian propaganda put out by the american insurance industry' b'and the ama.' b'' b'in a few cases, such as mr. case, the critiques are well-reasoned and' b'worthy of response. most others are misinformed, illogical,' b'or just plain dumb. i don\'t think the same can be said of the "american' b'proponents" of the canadian system, much less of the canadian proponents.' b'' b'jsh' b'--' b'"one thing about data, it sure does cut| uucp: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh' b'the bulls**t." r. hofferbert ma bell: b''
