b'' b'' b'' b'' b'i am looking for a new tank bag now, and i wondered if you, as follow' b'fj1100/1200 owners, could make some suggestions as to what has, and has' b'not worked for you. if there is already a file on this i apologize for' b'asking and will gladly accept any flames that are blown my way!' b'' b"i've got a belstaff tankbag on my fj1100, and it ain't too good. it's" b'difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tank/fairing/sidepanel layout,' b'and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches,' b'so you get the horn on full left lock and the starter motor on full right!!' b"if i was buying another i think i'd go for a magnetic one."
