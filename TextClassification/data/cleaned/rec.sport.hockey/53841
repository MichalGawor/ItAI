b'' b'i agree. it was great for the espn people to show the detroit game. (my' b'roommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (thanks' b'for explaining the significance of that btw)) the only problem i had was' b'when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and' b'music. especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the' b'boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. other' b"then that, hats off to espn. now if they'll only make a habit of this. yeah" b'right! baseball seasons started (zzzzzz.....) b'' b'koz' b'' b'lets go caps!!'
