b'' b'one of my biggest complaints about using the word "fundamentalist"' b'is that (at least in the u.s.a.) people speak of muslime' b'fundamentalists ^^^^^^^muslim' b'but nobody defines what a jewish or christan fundamentalist is.' b'i wonder what an equal definition would be..' b'any takers..' b'' b'the american press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to' b'refer to both christians and jews. christian fundementalists are' b'often refered to in the context of anti-abortion protests. the' b'american media also uses fundamentalist to refer to jews who live in' b'judea, samaria or gaza, and to any jew who follows the torah.' b'' b'adam' b'' b'"if we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we sure' b'wouldn\'t waste them on members of congress..." -john perry barlow'
