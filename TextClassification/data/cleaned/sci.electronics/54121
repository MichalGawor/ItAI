b'' b'\tdo you know any assembly language at all? all anyone needs to do if' b'find the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a jmp instruction' b'to just completely skip it. not that difficult, really! and there is very' b'little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing. using pklite or' b'some similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .exe' b'were tagged as uncompressable.' b'' b"and even that doesn't help, there are at least two programs available" b'that fixes this (unp and dislite, both available from simtel-20). and' b"even without them it isn't that hard to fix."
