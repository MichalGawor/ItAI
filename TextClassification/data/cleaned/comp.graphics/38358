b'' b'' b' hi netters,' b'' b" i'm building a cad package and need a 3d graphics library that can handle" b' some rudimentry tasks, such as hidden line removal, shading, animation, etc.' b'' b' can you please offer some recommendations?' b'' b"it's really not that hard to do. there are books out there which explain" b'everything, and the basic 3d functions, translation, rotation, shading, and' b'hidden line removal are pretty easy. i wrote a program in a few weeks witht' b'he help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source.' b'also, quickdraw has a lot of 3d functions built in, and think pascal' b'can access them, and i would expect that think c could as well. if you can' b'find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent' b'choice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the mac, so should be' b'fast.' b'' b'libertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal techno-rat.' b''
