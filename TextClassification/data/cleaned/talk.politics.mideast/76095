b'' b'| b'| i guess hasan finally revealed the source of his claim that israel' b'| diverted water from lebanon--his imagination.' b'| b'| mr. water-head,' b'| i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers, in fact i said that' b'| israel went into southern lebanon to make sure that no' b'| water is being used on the lebanese' b'| side, so that all water would run into jordan river where there' b'| israel will use it !#$%^%&&*-head.' b'|' b'| of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more' b'| difficult. you have not bothered to substantiate this in' b'| any way. basil, do you know of any evidence that would support' b'| this?' b'' b'i agree with shai, there are many references to israeli' b'plans on the litani river but i have yet to find hard' b'evidence. i had mentioned before that there is a report' b'commissioned by the un to study the litani river, it is' b"still in draft form. the israeli gov't also commissioned" b'a study on the river that was done by dr. ben wolfe.' b'the litani starts in the bekaa valley in lebanon,' b'flows southward, then west across south lebanon and' b'discharges into the mediterranean near the city of tyre.' b'there are other rivers such as the hasbani and the wazzani' b'that start in lebanese territory than join the jordan river.' b'the most mentioned plan was one that would divert water' b'from the litani into these, then the water would flow' b'naturally into the lac de houle. but there is no evidence' b'of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least' b'3 km long). the area is mountainous, inaccessible and' b'occupied by israel so i have not seen any independent' b'reports of the existence of any diversion structure there.' b'another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells.' b'it is also rumored that israe has m wells' b'tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the' b'israeli side of the border. if such wells are indeed' b'under use they would be costly to operate' b"(high energy costs) and the lebanese and israeli gov't should" b'agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers' b'as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral' b'negociations on "regional issues". the fact that we have' b'been at war all this time has led to the current state' b'of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is' b'completely unregulated.' b'' b'' b'basil' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'| hasan' b'|' b'| b'| shai guday stealth bombers,' b'| os software engineer b'| thinking machines corp. |\tthe winged ninjas of the skies.' b'| cambridge, ma
