b'' b'' b' my advice is this: if you know someone that you have the hots for who is' b' not a christian, befriend them and try to develop just a friendship with' b' them. at the same time, witness and share the gospel with them, not so' b' that you can date them, but so that they can be saved. once they become a' b' christian, then it is quite possible to let the relationship progress' b" beyond friendship. however, if they don't accept christ, you still have a" b" good friendship and you haven't wasted a lot of emotional energy and gotten" b' hurt.' b'' b'while i agree with most of jon says (i deleted those parts, of course), i' b'have serious reservations about this advice. maintaining a `just' b"friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done. people" b'usually end up getting hurt. this is especially likely to happen when' b'they start off with feelings of attraction.' b'' b'when people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.' b"i've had the experience of going quickly from believing that i shouldn't" b'date non-christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to' b'believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each' b'other. when the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to' b'their original state.' b'' b'this is an especially extreme case because i was young and away from home' b"and fellowship. i don't think it would work exactly this way for most" b"people. however, it's important not to underestimate the power of" b'feelings of attraction.' b''
