b'' b'i got a price quote of for a camry v6 w/abs from a toyota dealer in' b'eatontown. i came back to that dealer in two weeks to sign a purchase agreement.' b'then i was told that the salesperson made an error in pricing. i walked out of' b'that dealer. i wonder if this kind of practice is common with toyota dealers b"is the price quote written on the salesperson's business card binding?" b'i would appricate any comments.' b'' b'' b'i had a similar experience. we had a written quote which had been mailed' b'to us from the salesman at one of these "no-haggle" toyota dealers for' b'a camry xle w/abs, leather, etc. the price seemed fair, but when we' b'went in to take them up on their offer, they "discovered" that certain' b"extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote." b'it would have totaled an extra and, in spite of the fact that we' b'had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do.' b'' b'bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that' b"the toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they" b"don't have to deal. we walked, went out and bought a new lh car" b"(eagle vision tsi) and i don't regret it one bit!" b'' b'--' b'thad mcculloch' b''
