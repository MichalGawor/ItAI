b'' b'there has been some talk recently of latin rites from the early church used to' b'bless same-sex unions.if anyone has any idea where copies of these rites' b'exist (in whole or in part), please notify me by e-mail. (i understand that' b'similar ceremonies written in slavonic exist as well. let me know where i can' b"find these.) it doesn't matter whether the latin rite is in the original or a" b'translation. however, i would prefer to have an english version of the slavon-' b'ic rite, if it exists. thanks in advance.' b'' b'' b"[we've had questions about this in the past. the only source i know" b'of is claims by john boswell in some talks. he is said to be working' b'on publication, but as far as i know, nothing is published yet. i' b"haven't heard of any other source. if anyone knows of another source," b"please tell us. but i think we're going to have to wait for boswell's" b"publication to appear in order to see what he's really talking about." b'--clh]'
