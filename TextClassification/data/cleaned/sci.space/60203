b'' b' i had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in' b' first and second grade they came in chocolate,' b' strawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long' b' and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed' b' like space foil at the time).' b'' b'wasn\'t there a "plain" flavor too? they looked more like some' b'kind of extruded industrial product than food perfectly' b'smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends. kinda scary.' b'' b' the taste is hard to describe, although i remember it fondly. it was' b' most certainly more "candy" than say a modern "power bar." sort of' b' a toffee injected with vitamins. the chocolate power bar is a rough' b' approximation of the taste. strawberry sucked.' b'' b'an other post described it as like a "microwaved tootsie roll" b'which captures the texture pretty well. as for taste, they were' b'like candy, only not very sweet does that make sense? i recall' b'liking them for their texture, not taste. i guess i have well' b'developed texture buds.' b'' b' man, these were my "60\'s."' b'' b'it was obligatory to eat a few while watching "captain scarlet".' b"does anybody else remember _that_, as long as we're off the" b'topic of space?' b'' b'shag' b'' b'--' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'rob unverzagt
