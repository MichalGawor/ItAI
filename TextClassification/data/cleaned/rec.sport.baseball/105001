b'' b'' b' \tthe subject line says it all. what is the rule that qualifies' b' a pitcher as making a save?' b'' b"imho this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all" b'of baseball. my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot' b'pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least' b'appear in the on-deck circle. also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot' b'excede three runs.' b'' b'i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in' b'determining winners/savers/etc. for instance, a pitcher can come in in the' b'ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in' b'the next half inning and earn the win. has this pitcher earned a win, no' b'way.' b'' b'i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his' b'teammates rally to tie the score. assume he came in to start the fourth' b'and left after the eighth. his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in' b'the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win. the' b'third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no "stat"' b'satisfaction.' b'' b'mike' b'' b'i bleed the blue of dodgers and even like lasorda spaghetti sauce.' b''
