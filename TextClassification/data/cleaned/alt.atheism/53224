b'' b'|' b'| explain to me' b'| how instinctive acts can be moral acts, and i am happy to listen.' b'| for example, if it were instinctive not to murder...' b'| b'| then not murdering would have no moral significance, since there' b'| would be nothing voluntary about it.' b'|' b'| see, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significant' b'| if it is "voluntary." why do you think this?' b'' b'if you force me to do something, am i morally responsible for it?' b'' b'|' b'| and anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.' b'' b'well, make up your mind. is it to be "instinctive not to murder"' b'or not?' b'' b'|' b'| so, only intelligent beings can be moral, even if the bahavior of other' b'| beings mimics theirs?' b'| b'| you are starting to get the point. mimicry is not necessarily the' b'| same as the action being imitated. a parrot saying "pretty polly"' b"| isn't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly." b'|' b'| you are attaching too many things to the term "moral," i think.' b'| let\'s try this: is it "good" that animals of the same species' b"| don't kill each other. or, do you think this is right?" b'' b"it's not even correct. animals of the same species do kill" b'one another.' b'' b'|' b'| or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do' b'| is either right nor wrong?' b'' b'sigh. i wonder how many times we have been round this loop.' b'' b'i think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.' b'i am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as' b'primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem' b'to exhibit self-awareness.' b'' b'|' b'|' b'| animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily, but' b"| they don't." b'| b'| they do. i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly' b'| this, but you seem to have a very short memory.' b'|' b"| those weren't arbitrary killings. they were slayings related to some" b'| sort of mating ritual or whatnot.' b'' b'so what? are you trying to say that some killing in animals' b'has a moral significance and some does not? is this your' b'natural morality' b'' b'' b'|' b"| are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because" b"| most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do?" b'| b"| i'm saying:" b'| \t"there must be the possibility that the organism it\'s not' b'| \tjust people we are talking about can consider alternatives."' b'| b"| it's right there in the posting you are replying to." b'|' b"| yes it was, but i still don't understand your distinctions. what" b'| do you mean by "consider?" can a small child be moral? how about' b'| a gorilla? a dolphin? a platypus? where is the line drawn? does' b'| the being need to be self aware?' b'' b'are you blind? what do you think that this sentence means?' b'' b'"there must be the possibility that the organism it\'s not' b'just people we are talking about can consider alternatives."' b'' b'what would that imply?' b'' b'|' b'| what *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of' b"| the same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other? don't" b"| you find the fact that they don't at all significant?" b'' b'i find the fact that they do to be significant.' b'' b'jon.'
