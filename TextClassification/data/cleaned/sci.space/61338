b'' b'' b'well, i seem to have struck an interesting discussion off. given that i' b"am not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist, i'll have to boil it" b'down a bit.' b'' b'1) all the data on bursts to date, shows a smooth random distribution.' b'' b"2) that means they aren't concentrated in galactic cores, our or someone" b'elses.' b'' b'3) if the distribution is smooth, we are either seeing some enormously' b'large phenomena scattered at the edge of the universe said phenomena' b'being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena' b'or' b'we are seeing some phenomena out at like the oort cloud, but then it needs' b"some potent little energy source, that isn't detectable by any other" b'current methods.' b'' b"4) we know it's not real close, like slightly extra solar, because" b'we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.' b'' b'5) the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or' b'super string impacts or something like that.' b'' b'so everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile.' b'' b"what i am wondering, is this in people's opinion, a new physics problem." b'' b'einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect.' b'' b'copernicus, started looking at irregularities in planetary motion.' b'' b'is this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics?' b'just a little speculative thinking folks.' b'' b'pat'
