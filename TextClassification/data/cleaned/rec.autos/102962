little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)' b'parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts' b"underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical)." b'assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not' b'stitched properly. hopefully just a fluke.' b"ford only gives key with the car. c'mon ford, spend an extra few pennies!" b"rear hatch has no padding on corners when up. i'm waiting for the day when" b'i bash my head on the corner.' b'horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)' b'tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car' b'' b'my likes:' b'engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) definitely b'handling (very good for fwd; understeer only at limits)' b'transmission (the speed is a must)' b'usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)' b"very little torque steer at full power (much better than the sho i drive)" b'stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)' b'low cowl (good visibility in front)' b'heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)' b'abs/air bag (see above)' b'rear seats fold down (i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)' b'no shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)' b'tires: 225/55vr16 goodyear eagles left; hoping for 30k b'' b"as you can see, i'm primarily interested in the engine. while it doesn't" b'have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling' b'point for me was the all-aluminum value liter engine.' b'' b"the overall car is a good buy for the money. that market segment hasn't changed" b'much since july (prelude vtec, honda del sol??). i drive it to and from work' b'each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the' b"probe's suspension doesn't like potholes. when you test drive one, find a" b'potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.' b"if you have passengers, by all means bring them along too. they'll find" b"that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides" b'differently (if that\'s "better" is up to you). also, there\'s a lot of glass' b"around you which i wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty" b'hot in the summer. my back seat passengers (now very few) complain about' b'the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with' b"the heat. i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine." b"leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when i got the car so" b"i can't comment on them (i got the car before it was officially announced)." b'i prefer cloth to leather anyway.' b'' b"i wouldn't want this car in the snow: the suspension is too rough for the" b"inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume" b"that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing. rain is much better: water" b'generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper' b'controls are easy and understandable, and i barely hydroplaned once with the' b'eagles (and i was really trying).' b'there is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places. the gt' b"has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic" b"that could fit two cassettes or cd's max. the center console/storage bin/arm" b'rest has cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth "pouch"' b"but that's it. no change holders. quite a let-down from the sho." b'and the probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!' b'' b"lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back. the foam will soak the" b'water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant b'' b'nathan' b'' b'' b'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^' b'|jeremy mereness support ye olde disclaimer: b'| fast project, cmu-gsia software| opinions, alone. b'|b.s. mechanical engineering, cmu| ya gotta love it. b"| every silver lining's got a touch of grey b'------------------------------------------------------------------------' b' this year marks the 200th anniversary of the bill of rights' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'"no comment"/they\'re coming to take me away, ha-ha! napolean xiv'
