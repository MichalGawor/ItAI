b'' b'' b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i remember running across an ad in the back of mac[user|world]' b'a few years ago, for a nubus board that had umpteen simm slots, to be' b'used to "recycle your old simms," when you upgraded memory. i don\'t' b"remember who made this board, and i haven't seen it advertised in" b'any of the latest mac magazines. it mentioned that it included software' b'to make the simms on the board act like a ram disk. as someone who has simms' b"he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly" b"good idea. does anyone out there know what board/company i'm talking about?" b'are they still in business, or does anyone know where i can get a used one' b'if they are no longer made? any help would be greatly appreciated. please' b'e-mail me, to save net.bandwidth.' b'' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'cap.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'consilio manuque' b'otium cum dignitate' b'credo quia absurdum est parturient montes nascetur ridiculus mus'
