b'' b'' b'what are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms?' b'i know des is bits ("tripple des" is bits) and idea is bits. is' b'there anything made in the us that has bit keys? anything anywhere' b"that has larger keys? i've heard that rc2 can be scaled to arbitrarily" b'large keys, but is this actually implemented anywhere?' b'' b'my mdc cipher (which uses any one-way hash function as a cfb-mode stream' b'cipher, the current implementation uses md5) uses a key of up to bits' b'(that is, you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire' b'2048-bit range, or you can use the entire bits). runtime is' b'independant of key size, the system runs slightly slower than md5 itself.' b'i presume rc2 and rc4 use a similar system (or possibly they just hash an' b'arbitrary-length key down to n bits, maybe using something like md5).' b'' b'peter.'
