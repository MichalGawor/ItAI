b'' b'' b'sorry, bryan, this is not quite correct. remember the vgalib package that comes' b'with linux/sls? it will switch to vga 320x200x256 mode *without* xwindows.' b"so at least it is *possible* to write a gif viewer under linux. however i don't" b'think that there exists a similar svga package, and viewing gifs in 320x200 is' b'not very nice.' b'' b'no, vgalib? amazing.. i guess it was lost in all those subdirs b"thanks for correcting me. it doesn't sound very appealing though, only" b"320x200? i'm glad it wasn't something major i missed." b'' b"tommy frandsen's vgalib (which is probably what you're talking about)" b'will do the standard vga modes, some tweaked modes and then the tseng' b"et4000 super vga modes. i have an et4000 and i'm viewing gif's at" b'640x480/256 (i have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on linux. i' b'think i had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it' b'use the et4k modes.' b'' b"vgalib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new super vga" b"support; each mode is an array of register values and there's a program" b'that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current' b"mode. haven't tried it though..." b'' b'(btw, my version of vgalib is b'' b'--' b"try linux, a free unix by linus torvalds for 386+'s. read comp.os.linux" b'(or ask me by email if you like) for more information. you can run x11,' b'tex, gnu emacs and much more on top of a nice posix environment.'
