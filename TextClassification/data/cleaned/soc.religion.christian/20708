"a man\'s got to know his limitations." don\'t be one of the "whosoever' b'wont\'s."' b'' b'this is a ridiculous argument for being a christian. so then, you might' b'consider switching from christianity to another religion if you were' b'offered an even more frightening description of another hell? how many' b'christians do think there are who view it strictly as an insurance policy?' b'not many i know; they believe in a message of love and compassion for' b'others. a faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional' b"relationship with god. like a child who cringes in fear of a parent's" b'physical violence.' b'' b'many religions have concrete views of heaven and hell, with various' b'threats and persuasions regarding who will go where. competition over' b'who can envison the worst hell can hardly nurture the idea of loving' b'your neighbor as yourself.' b'' b'--rex' b'' b'--' b'comments, criticism welcome...' b'-ken'
