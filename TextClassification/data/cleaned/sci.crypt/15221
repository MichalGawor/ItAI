b'' b'the stragegy of the government is interesting. the real fear comes from' b'them doing more than this.' b'' b'this is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on' b'the surface.' b'' b'their strategy is a business one rather than legal one. they are' b'pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they' b'get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market.' b"it will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have" b'registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for' b'most phone companies.' b'' b"you see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any" b'cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow' b'the standard. at&t has already announced a clipper chip encryption' b'product. the government has marketed hard to get major vendors to' b'use these chips. if they get enough market share, they will rule.' b'' b"and thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be" b"tapped by the police. the public isn't that concerned about it now," b'after all. they freely do calls that anybody with an old tv can listen' b"to today! they won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure" b'them only from the police.' b'' b'well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with' b'other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones' b'expensive. unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them' b'cheap, only the mob will buy them.' b'' b'and this means that the fbi will want to track the customer lists of' b'better encryption phones, because "the only reason a person would want' b'one is to evade the police."' b'' b'interesting.' b'--' b'brad templeton, clarinet communications corp. sunnyvale, ca
