b'' b'many high-end graphics cards come with c source code for doing basic graphics' b'sorts of things (change colors, draw points/lines/polygons/fills, etc.). does' b'such a library exist for generic vga graphics cards/chips, hopefully in the' b'public domain? this would be for the purpose of compiling under a non-dos' b'operating system running on a standard pc.' b'' b'' b"i'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library" b'package to do pc vga graphics.' b'' b"i'm currently working on a realtime application running on a pcc with a" b"non-dos kernel that needs to do some simple graphics. i'm not sure if" b'reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not.' b"i suspect i'll implement the display controller as a server process that" b'handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time. if this' b'provides sufficiently frequent display updates then i believe that i can' b'restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus' b'constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need' b'for a reentrant graphics library.' b'' b'being fairly new to the realtime systems world i may be overlooking something,' b'what do you think?' b'' b'cheers,'
