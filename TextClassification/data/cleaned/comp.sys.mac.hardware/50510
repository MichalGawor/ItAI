b'' b'i recently aquired a quantum q250 harddisk. it is a meg b'mechanism. it is scsi. i have a few questions and a few problems. first' b"there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that i can't" b'figure out what it is for. the address is set by some jumpers on the' b"bottom so i don't think it is for that. any ideas?" b'' b'second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. there are' b"a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for." b'' b'third, i have got the drive to format. it took a while to get things to' b'work and most of it is fine for now. the formating initialy was' b'troublesome but seems to be ok. the main problem is if you do a reset on' b'the macplus the drive disappears. if i shut the mac off and then back on' b'agian then the drive comes up fine. any ideas.' b'' b'please reply to one of the email addresses below.' b'' b'thanks' b'' b'richard crispin' b'waterloo, ontario phone:(519)888-4781 or ext. b'canada n2l 3g1 fax:(519)746-8631'
