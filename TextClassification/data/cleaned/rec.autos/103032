b'' b' ...(relates an experience similar to mine) b' then comes the part i wish i could have videotaped. as we go out' b' the front door, the sales manager shouts across the entire showroom,' b' customers and all, "go ahead! you deserve to buy a nissan!"' b' so my friend bought a sentra.' b' b'' b"this kind of behavior is what i was shocked by in my 'experience'. for" b'crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers' b"this way and still stay in business? again, i don't expect sales people to" b"bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but i sure don't expect to be" b'abused either. i was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to' b"me and in other 'negotiating' sessions i overheard in neighboring sales" b'cubicles. evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue' b'to do business this way. there must be a lot of people out there who are' b'easy to intimidate.' b'' b"on the other hand, i'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'" b'approach that saturn and other are starting to use. i guess if their fixed' b"price is fair it's ok. maybe the best approach is to do your homework" b'before you go in. find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable' b'profit for the dealer offer them that price and stick to' b"it. if they get abusive, just leave. then, don't let them try to screw you" b'after the deal is agreed on.' b'' b'mark'
