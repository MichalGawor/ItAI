b'' b'' b'what is the real story here? can i hook up any pc svga montitor to the' b"centris internal video? do i need to make my own cable if it doesn't not" b'come with one? has apple released a tech note with the pinouts for doing' b'such? the reasoj i ask is that it seems the prices for svga are lower than' b'that of their mac counterparts...' b'--mike' b'' b'**************************' b'' b'having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes. at' b'least for the 600x400 configuration. you can get an adaptor called mac' b'vga -q from james engineering and this will let you' b'display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable. i think the' b'800x600 requires 56khz horizontal sync. i use this on my sony b'(gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.' b'' b'hope it helps' b'-a.'
