b'' b'' b" i got a question from my dad which i really can't answer and i'd appreciate" b' some net.wisdom.' b'' b' his question is about some diameter balls which are attached to' b" electric power lines in his area. he's seen up to a half dozen between" b' two poles. neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution.' b' my only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the' b' inductance of the grid, but why so many between two poles?.' b"i'll bet there's a runway nearby." b'' b'jeff babb' b'programmer, sdsu larc'
