b'' b'' b'natural morality may specifically be thought of as a code of ethics that' b'a certain species has developed in order to survive.' b'wait. are we talking about ethics or morals here?' b'' b'is the distinction important?' b'' b'we see this countless' b'times in the animal kingdom, and such a "natural" system is the basis for' b'our own system as well.' b'huh?' b'' b'well, our moral system seems to mimic the natural one, in a number of ways.' b'' b'in order for humans to thrive, we seem to need' b'to live in groups,' b'here\'s your problem. "we *seem* to need". what\'s wrong with the highlighted' b'word?' b'' b"i don't know. what is wrong? is it possible for humans to survive for" b"a long time in the wild? yes, it's possible, but it is difficult. humans" b'are a social animal, and that is a cause of our success.' b'' b'and in order for a group to function effectively, it' b'needs some sort of ethical code.' b'this statement is not correct.' b'' b"isn't it? why don't you think so?" b'' b"and, by pointing out that a species' conduct serves to propogate itself," b'i am not trying to give you your tautology, but i am trying to show that' b'such are examples of moral systems with a goal. propogation of the species' b'is a goal of a natural system of morality.' b'so anybody who lives in a monagamous relationship is not moral? after all,' b'in order to ensure propogation of the species, every man should impregnate' b'as many women as possible.' b'' b'no. as noted earlier, lack of mating (such as abstinence or homosexuality)' b"isn't really destructive to the system. it is a worst neutral." b'' b'for that matter, in herds of horses, only the dominate stallion mates. when' b'he dies/is killed/whatever, the new dominate stallion is the only one who' b'mates. these seems to be a case of your "natural system of morality" trying' b'to shoot itself in the figurative foot.' b'' b'again, the mating practices are something to be reexamined...' b'' b'keith'
