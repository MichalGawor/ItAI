b'' b'' b'my point? rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. and no stat (or lack' b'of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. maybe no stat can tell me,' b'either, but some people are... i just know it!!! b'' b'i was *hoping* somebody would mention clutch. clutch? baerga? the' b'two words simply do not go together. with runners in scoring' b"position, baerga batted last year. this doesn't quite" b'*suck*, but most batters hit *better* in this situation.' b'' b'alomar? he hit with runners in scoring position!' b'' b'the difference? alomar had rbis in such ab. baerga had b'rbis in such ab. baerga got more chances, yet succeeded only' b'20% more times.' b'' b"frankly, i don't believe in clutch. but if i did, my vote would" b'go to alomar for mvp (let alone "best 2b in the al").' b'' b'-valentine'
