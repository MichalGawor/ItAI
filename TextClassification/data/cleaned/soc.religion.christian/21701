b'' b'' b'seeing as how _the_two_babylons_ has been brought up again, it is time for' b'me to respond once again, and say that this book is junk. it is nothing' b'more that an anti-catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there' b'were protestants. its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.' b'' b'' b'i have not seen this book, though i have had several people quote it in' b'support of some tendentious assertions they were making, so i have become' b'curious about it.' b'' b"i don't want to malign this hislop fellow, whoever he may be, as i have only" b'heard the arguments at second hand, but both of the arguments seemed to turn' b'on false etymology that seemed to be derived from hislop.' b'' b'i would be interested in knowing more about these things.' b'' b'the first one claimed that the word "church" was derived from the greek' b'"cyclos", and that it was therefore related to the worship of "circe".' b'' b"i don't know if hislop is the source of this assertion, but it does seem to" b'be based on false etymology.' b'' b'the second claimed an etymological relationship between "ishtar" and' b'"easter", which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some' b'of the wilder notions of the british israelites.' b'' b'regarding the latter, as far as i have been able to find out, "easter" is' b'derived from the old english name for april "eosturmonath". the venerable' b'bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called "eostre", but' b'apart from that reference i have not been able to find out anything more' b'about her. it also seems that the term "easter" is only used by the english' b'and those they evangelized. the germans, for example, also use the term' b'"ostern", but germany was evangelized by english missionaries.' b'' b'so i would be interested in any evidence of "easter" being used for pascha' b'by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient anglo-' b'saxons and their offshoots. such evidence might support the claims of those' b'who appear to derive the theory from hislop.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'============================================================' b'steve hayes, department of missiology editorial department' b'univ. of south africa, p.o. box pretoria, south africa' b'faq: missiology is the study of christian mission and is part of' b'the faculty of theology at unisa'
