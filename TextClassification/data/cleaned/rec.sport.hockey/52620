b'' b' i was reading a newspaper tidbit that mentioned that there is a' b' grammatical error on the stanley cup. this newspaper, "the' b' union leader" (manchester, new hampshire), stated that one of the' b' years that the new york islanders won the cup, the printing on the' b' actual cup stated "new york ilanders". can anyone verify this?? i' b' forgot the exact year that this supposedly occured. any die-hard' b' islander fans know about this?? the reason why i am asking is' b' because the paper is not very reliable, we call it "the union' b' mis-leader".' b'' b'' b' randy' b' plymouth state college' b'' b'speaking of spelling errors on the cup, i wonder if the "h" in' b'pittsburgh made it to the cup. you know how funny people can' b'be about spelling pittsburgh.' b'--' b'warren arbogast' b'darden visual communications "with miles behind them' b'university of virginia and more to go"' b''
