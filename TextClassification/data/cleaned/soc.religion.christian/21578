b'' b'any attempts to make homosexuals' b'feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible' b'with christianity. is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone' b'try to become closer to jesus, we need to keep them away.' b'' b'this is too often true. many people try to place this as a "higher"' b'sin. however...' b'' b'does jesus need' b'us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin. do we really mistrust' b'jesus when he says he can forgive any sin?' b'' b'a big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people' b'advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider' b"(active) homosexuality a sin. i don't often see the attitude of" b'"forgive me and i will try to change". instead i see "there\'s nothing' b'wrong with my life and i can be a good christian, so it must be you who' b'have an illness because you don\'t accept me". christians can and will' b'accept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.' b'' b'sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual but it' b'is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin! i was born with' b"a desire to sin, but i work to prevent myself from sinning. it's" b'much less common now, but i *still* have urges to lash out in' b'anger. there also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful' b'desires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church' b'when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after' b'several years.' b'' b'--' b'darin johnson' b'"particle man, particle man, doing the things a particle can"'
