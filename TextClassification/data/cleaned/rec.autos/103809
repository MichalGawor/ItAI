b'' b'' b"i've owned a saturn for and year and a half, and didn't have the extended" b"warranty, but just traded it in for a (for reasons that i won't mention" b'unless someone wants to know.) i opted for the year/60,000 mile extended with' b"$50 deductible. it's sorta like buying health insurance. you could say that" b"you're not sick now, and haven't been sick for a while, but you can't guarantee" b"that you won't be sick tomorrow. a little money invested today is better than" b'being sick tomorrow and now being able to pay for it, or having to pay a lot' b'more tomorrow than you can today.' b'' b'justify all you want. extended warranties are a ripoff, high profit item for' b"the dealer. and you didn't buy 5yr/60k, you get 3yr/36k *free*, so what you" b'bought is 2yr/24k. and you still have to pay every time you use this' b"great 'warranty'. better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs" b'if/when you need it. considering that your last car was only years old,' b"are you sure you will even keep this new one past it's *free* warranty period?" b"btw, typical profit on extended warranties is around that's right, only" b'20% of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future' b'repairs that the group of extended-warranty-people collect.' b''
