b'' b"i've recently listened to a tape by dr. stanislaw burzynski, in which he" b'claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti-' b'cancer properties that he names antineoplastons. burzynski says that his' b'work has met with hostility in the united states, despite the favorable' b'responses of his subjects during clinical trials.' b'' b"what is the generally accepted opinion of dr. burzynski's research? he" b'paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an' b'intolerant medical establishment, but i have no basis from which to judge' b"his claims. two weeks ago, however, i read that the nih's department of" b"alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynski's" b"work. their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldn't investigate a" b"treatment that didn't seem promising." b'' b"any opinions on burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current" b'status of his research would be appreciated.' b'' b'--' b'joshua schwimmer'
