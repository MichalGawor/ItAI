b'' b"in light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals, i'd love to" b'see a unix-based encryption scheme that:' b'' b'1) kept some files encrypted on the host machine (say, all the files in your' b'home directory)' b'2) used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a' b'modem line.' b'' b'it seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a' b'way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not, among other things.' b'' b"i'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system." b'' b'does such a system exist? if it were made easy-to-use and readily' b'available, i think it would be a good thing(tm). i realize that this' b'would probably just involve putting a nice front-end on a readily available' b'and very secure encryption scheme, but it should be done.' b'' b'thanks for the ear,' b'brad'
