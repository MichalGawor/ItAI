b'' b'' b" ok, roger, here's a question for you. say you are running an expansion" b"team. you don't have a team at the moment, but the draft is coming up. who" b'are you going to pick, guys who have won the most ws rings, or guys who' b'could contribute the most to your team. say the reds were dumb enough to' b"not protect larkin, and the jays didn't protect alfredo. who would you" b'pick?' b'' b"for an expansion team? i'm pretty sure i would go with the rings, as long" b"as their salaries and ages weren't too high. i would want the fans to be" b'able to identify the players. i would like a championship attitude in the' b'clubhouse.' b'' b'as for larkin and griffin? salaries aside, i would have to consider which' b'player is likeliest to contribute to a ws victory. past performance, age and' b"attitude would all be integral to my decision. i certainly wouldn't just" b'haul out my copy of gillete and pick larkin, as many others would. and,' b'unlike many others who post to this group, i hardly consider myself quali-' b'fied to make those kinds of decisions.' b'' b" (i can't believe i'm getting involved in this... b'' b'i have never been able to believe it about myself, to tell you the truth.' b"it's like banging your head against a stone wall." b'' b'--' b'' b'"so many morons...' b'rm ...and so little time."'
