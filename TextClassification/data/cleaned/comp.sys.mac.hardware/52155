b'' b' i purchased 2x8 mb 72-pin ns) simms for my quadra from chip' b" merchant (i've been very satisfied with them in the past). either one" b' alone works, but both together fail. i called apple for advice and was' b' told that there was a problem with "composite" simms. only non-composite' b' simms should be used with the q-800. chip merchant confirmed that they' b' presently sell only composite 72-pin simms. so, q-800 simms need to be' b' both ns and non-composite.' b'' b'8 mb simms do not have to be composite simms, although many (most?) mb' b'simms are. 72-pin simms allow two memory banks per simm, thus permitting' b'the use of mb dram devices (the same ones used on mb simms) to be used' b"for two mb banks on one simm. i can't imagine that it would be cheaper" b'to build an mb simm using mb drams as the mb parts reached (and' b'exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the mb parts some time ago.' b"it's probably possible to build a single-bank mb simm using mb parts b"this could cause problems in a q800. i'm not sure why you'd want to do" b'this, though, as a dual-bank mb simm would be cheaper to build than a' b'single-bank composite one.' b'' b'- dale adams'
