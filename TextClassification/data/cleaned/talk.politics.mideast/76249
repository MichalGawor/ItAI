b'' b'' b" btw, with bosnia's large moslem population, why have nations like" b' turkey, saudi arabia, syria, egypt, and others with either money' b' or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered' b' to help out bosnia?' b'' b"obviously, you really don't know." b'' b"they *have* spoken out (cf sec'y of state christopher's recent trip to the me)," b'' b'note the clause "more forcibly", above. my point is that they have' b"made a few pro-forma, perfunctory remarks, and sent in a few c-130's and" b"so forth, but it's clearly not something they're losing much sleep over." b'they\'re just going through the motions, while moslems are being "ethnically' b'cleansed" out of what used to be yugoslavia. the us has been speaking' b'out far more loudly than the moslem nations in the un and other world' b'forums.' b'' b'' b" besides, there's no case that can be made for us military involvement" b" there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, liberia, angola, or" b" (it appears with the khmer rouge's new campaign) cambodia. non-whites" b" don't count?" b'' b'hmm...some might say kuwaitis are non-white. ooops, i forgot, kuwaitis are' b'"oil rich", "loaded with petro-dollars", etc so they don\'t count.' b'' b'precisely. humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification' b'for us involvement in the gulf oil and geopolitics were. if the' b"the kuwaitis didn't have oil (and assuming iraq still saw fit to" b'invade them) i doubt you would have seen operation desert storm.' b'' b'' b'---peter' b'' b'' b''
