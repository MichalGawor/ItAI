b'' b"as the sharks' season came to a close tonight, i will start a series of posts," b'trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through' b'for the sharks for the past season. if you are uninterested, since i will' b'have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings, you can' b'kill them.' b'' b'i will first try to evaluate how the players did. these ratings, of course,' b'are subject to my own biases, but i hope that i can try to be as objective as' b'possible. i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks' b'and/or did not play for another nhl team this season.' b'' b"thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders..." b'' b'#1\tbrian hayward\t\tseason:\t11th' b"acquired:\t'91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft" b'grade:\t\tp (d)' b'' b'it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that' b"featured sharing three jennings trophies (with patrick roy, in and" b"'89). it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing" b'grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this' b'year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would' b'not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.' b'' b"but hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the sharks' first" b'ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the calgary flames.' b'as he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.' b'' b'#30\tjeff hackett\t\tseason: 3rd' b"acquired:\t'91-92, from n. y. islanders in expansion draft" b'grade:\t\tc' b'' b'hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team mvp honors last season, simply' b'wasted the year. other than a few good spots saves against los angeles,' b'almost-shutout against tampa bay, etc.), hackett, finishing with save' b"percentage and a gaa, watched his status go from the team's goalie to" b'bench decoration at the end of the season. he was expected, early, to carry' b'the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early' b'injury that forced him to miss games may have been a contributing factor,' b"but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task. he may not return next" b'year.' b'' b'#31\twade flaherty\t\tseason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)' b"acquired:\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent" b'grade:\t\ti (a-)' b'' b'it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the' b'incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the calgary' b'flames), flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods. he started' b"the season poorly in kansas city, but finished strong, prompting the blades'" b'owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp' b'honors. the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he' b'tries to make it into the nhl; last year, he was a capable backup for arturs' b'irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs, picking up' b"all-star honors along with irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can" b'share the job with irbe next year, because with prospects dan ryder, trevor' b"robins, and scott cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he" b'may not ever.' b'' b'#32\tarturs irbe\t\tseason:\t1st' b"acquired:\t'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft" b'grade:\t\tb+' b'' b'i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that' b"he's a bona fide nhl goaltender, perhaps a bona fide goaltender. he has" b'provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had, getting' b"the team's first ever shut-out against the los angeles kings on december b'he has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and' b'making passes, reminding people of a young ron hextall (except, of course, the' b'goonism). yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do' b'with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the sharks are to challenge for' b"a playoff spot next season, irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named" b'as a star of the game times in starts.' b'' b'===============================================================================' b'go calgary flames! al macinnis for norris! gary roberts for hart and smythe!' b'go edmonton oilers! go for playoffs next year! stay in edmonton!' b'===============================================================================' b'rec.sport.hockey contact for the san jose sharks'
