b'' b'' b' pink noise and white noise are equal amounts of all frequencies. this' b'is in most cases around the 20-3.3k hz range. pink/white are used to' b"adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that. there are a few eq's out" b'on the market that have pink noise built in. most all from audio' b'control have them i know the c-101 does.' b'' b'' b'with regards to what you wrote, how does one "adjust for room dynamics' b'and stuff like that"? i asked a professor that question just' b"last week and he didn't really know himself. since pink noise is believed" b"to be due to surface states (say, the surface of the silicon where there's" b'a lack of a covalent bond) that act as "traps" to nearby elecrons, and since' b"this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't" b'able to "trap" electrons), how do you compensate for that? it seems to me' b"that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise. i have seen the" b'"pink noise" feature, however, on many eqs, and i was wondering' b'how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to' b'"man made noise" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc. if you have' b"any information about this, it would be appreciated. hope this didn't sound" b'too drawn out. thanx.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
