b'' b'ok,' b'' b'i saw a bike today and i want to know what it is. lets begin' b'by saying that its whole rear end was definately hawk additionally,' b'it had a cbr900rr style tank, full fairing, and only a tach. now, at' b"first i thought it was an 'rc31' (a hawk modified by two brothers racing)," b'but i did not think that they made this huge tank for it. additionally,' b'the gauges were certainly not from a hawk. they looked much more like' b'900rr gauges. overall, the bike looked like a 900rr except for the' b'rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the hawk)' b'' b'so, what did i see?' b'' b'(ps, for any of you boulder doders, i saw it parked at the engineering' b'center today. it is white with light green stripes.)' b'' b'' b'________________________________________________________________________' b'nick coburn dod#6425 ama#679817' b"'88cbr1000 '89cbr600" b'________________________________________________________________________' b'' b''
