b'' b'|there are a lot of automobile accidents, but atleast there is some' b'|regulation to try to combat this. when i got my drivers license, i had' b'|to take a drivers safety class. i have to be licensed to drive. my car' b'|must be registered. i must (at least where i live) have liability' b'|insurance on both myself driving and my car (if someone else had an' b"|accident with it). hmm, wouldn't manditory saftey classes, registration" b'|of both the owner and gun, and manditory liability insurance be nice for' b'|gun owners.' b'' b"as i'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now, none of the above" b'measures are required for you *on your own property*. you do not have to' b'have a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and' b'you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own' b'and operate that vehicle on your own premises. if you are going to make use' b'of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate. and by the way, in texas' b'you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary' b"civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life." b'' b"so i won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or" b'*manadatory* liability insurance unless i get a federal law repealing' b'all local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the second' b'amendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good' b'anywhere in the united states. come on, you wanted the analogy.' b'' b'' b'mike ruff' b'--' b'- self be true. --polonius b'those who would sacrifice essential b'liberties for a little temporary b'safety deserve neither liberty b'nor safety. --b. franklin
