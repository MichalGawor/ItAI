b'' b'has anyone experienced a faint shadow at all resolutions using this' b'card. is only in windows. i have replaced card and am waiting on' b'latest drivers. also have experienced general protection fault errors' b'in wspdpsf.drv on winword tools option menu and in winfax setup.' b'i had a ati ultra but was getting genral protection fault errors' b'in an spss application. these card manufactures must have terrible' b'quality control to let products on the market with so many bugs.' b'what a hassle. running on gateway dx2/50.' b'thx dave l' b'' b'i have used both version drivers for win and the new drivers.' b"i have had none of these problems. no gpf's at all. i have a feeling that" b'your problems are not with the card or drivers. the ati ultra drivers are' b'considered some of the most reliable on the market, and the ss 24x ones' b'seem quite good as well. maybe you should check bios problems in your' b"gateway. i know a few people with gateway dx2's, and all of them have" b'found some problem or other with compatibility especially with graphics.' b'' b"the only gpf's i have ever had can be directly attributable to using/" b'abusing applications. i even got the newest drivers from diamond when' b'people started complaining. i still only have one small problem with' b'them, and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes/' b'reads to the swap file.' b'' b'greg bishop.'
