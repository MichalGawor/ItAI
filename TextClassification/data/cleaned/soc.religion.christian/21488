b'' b"if babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the bible" b'ever say so. it never comes right and says "only people that know' b'right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised."' b'' b'this is not a very sound argument for baptising babies. it assumes that' b"if the bible doesn't say specifically that you don't need to do something," b"then that must mean that you do need to do it. i know there's a specific" b'term for this form of logic, but it escapes me right now. however, if it' b'were sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; if the bible' b"doesn't specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be ok," b"which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question i've often pondered." b'if slavery is immoral (which i believe it is, can i assume that everyone' b"else in this group does too?), why doesn't jesus or any of the apostles" b'speak out against it? owning slaves was common practice back then. paul' b'speaks about everything else that is immoral. he apparently thought it' b'was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. why' b"doesn't anyone mention slavery? if god's morals are eternal and don't" b'change like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral then' b'as it is today.'
