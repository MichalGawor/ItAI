b'' b'the trackbal on my pb140 no longer moves in the horizontal direction. when i' b'called the nearest authorized apple service person i was told that it probably' b'needed replacing and that would cost me over ouch!' b'can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem? one strange' b'symptom of the problem is that when i take the ball out of the socket and shine' b'a light into the hole i can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the' b"wheel with my finger, it works fine that way but won't work if i turn off the" b'light. any suggestions or comments?' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
