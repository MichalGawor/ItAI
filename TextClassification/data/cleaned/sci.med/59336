b'' b'| ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year. it is still' b'| partially frozen, and i am still in physical therapy every week. but the' b'| pain has subsided almost completely. until last week when i mowed the' b'| lawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row. i have a push type power' b'| mower. the pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite' b'| a while, and i used ice and medicine again. can anybody explain why this' b'| particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally,' b'| should cause this shoulder problem?' b'' b"you need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower. if you haven't been" b"doing much exercise, as i suppose you haven't, then a constant minute" b'long effort can cause stiffness and cramps.' b'' b'-philippe'
