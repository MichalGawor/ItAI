b'' b';' b";most people wave or return my wave when i'm on my harley." b";other harley riders seldom wave back to me when i'm on my" b";duck. squids don't wave, or return waves ever, even to each" b';other, from what i can tell.' b';' b'; when we take a hand off the bars we fall down!' b'' b"the problem is that squids and badassbikers can't recognize" b'each other\'s waves. when you\'re riding a cruiser, you "wave"' b'by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without' b"first removing that hand from the handlebar. when you're" b'riding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about' b'ankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave.' b'' b'generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely' b"off the handlebar and wave it around, so it's easy to tell" b"when they're waving." b'' b'---' b'chris'
