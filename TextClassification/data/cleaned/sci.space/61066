b'' b'' b'as for advertising sure, why not? a nasa friend and i spent one' b"drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need" b'to put the golden arches of a certain american fast food organization' b'on the face of the moon. fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.' b'' b"hmmm. it actually isn't all that much, is it? like about million" b"km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2" b"per burger that said organization sold last year). you'd be best off" b'with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an' b'unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft).' b'if you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new' b'moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon.' b'you might have to abandon the colour, though.' b'' b'buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon lunar orbit' b'unmanned spraying craft, build said craft, establish a lunar base' b"to extract tio2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur" b"compound, i suppose) and some sort of propellant, and bob's your" b"uncle. i'll do it for, say, billion dollars (plus changes of" b'identity for me and all my loved ones). delivery date b'' b'can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink' b'vendors? who else might be interested?' b'' b"would they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and not" b'much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km' b'inflatable billboards in leo (or in geo, visible hours from your' b"key growth market). i'll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of" b'identity).' b''
