b'' b'dn a neurology' b'dn consultation is cheaper than a scan.' b'' b'and also better, because a neurologist can make a differential' b'diagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign' b'intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other' b'headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan. a neurologist' b'can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the' b'diagnosis.' b'' b'dn also, since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other' b'dn serious pathology, it may be cheaper to just get a ct scan then have' b'dn them come into the er every few weeks.' b'dn and easier than taking the time to reassure the patient, right?' b"dn personally, i don't think this can ever be justified." b'' b'sigh. it may never be justifiable, but i sometimes do it. even' b'after i try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic' b'examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,' b'salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask "why can\'t you' b'order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?" aunt millie often gets' b'into the conversation, as in "they ignored aunt millie\'s headaches' b'for years", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or' b'whatever. if you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a' b"patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, i'd like to hear" b'what your magic is.' b'' b'every once in a while i am able to bypass imaging by getting an eeg.' b"mind you, i don't think eeg is terribly sensitive for brain tumor," b'but the patient feels like "something is being done" (as if the' b'hours i spent talking with and examining the patient were' b'"nothing"), the eeg has no ionizing radiation, it\'s *much* cheaper' b'than ct or mri, and the eeg brings in some money to my department.' b'---' b''
