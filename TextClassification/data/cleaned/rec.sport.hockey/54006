b'' b'the isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being' b'down after periods. the caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady' b'defense and getting great goaltending from tabaracci. the isles power play' b'philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like' b"flatley, doesn't work against the caps. i hope al realizes this!! they have too" b'many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? if' b"last night's game is any omen, the isles could be on their way to that ole" b'championship form; coming from behind late in a game. my advice to the caps is' b'to pounce on those healy rebounds. flatley showed alot of heart by playing the' b'last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury' b'suffered at the hands of dale hunter. ray ferraro has arrived just in time for' b'the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us islander fans remember from an' b'italian from the past; john tonelli!!! it was tonelli who won a similar game' b'against the pens in game on the playoffs. the isles scored two late third' b'period goals to send the game into ot tied at in ot, tonelli scored the game' b'winner to send the isles to the next round. the isles have lacked this tenacity' b'for years, but perhaps its back! it was good to see the coliseum packed just' b'like the ole days!!! good luck to the isles the rest of the way!!!!!' b'' b'john scialdone' b'' b'"""and the home of the brave""" jerry garcia, bob weir, vince welnick' b'april opening day, candlestick park' b'' b''
