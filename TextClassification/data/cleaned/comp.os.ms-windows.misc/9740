b'' b'i just installed a new truetype font under ms-windows b'but though all the applications display the font correctly on the' b'screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly' b'(on a laserjet non-postscript printer).' b'' b'when i use the font in coreldraw, the document prints correctly, so i assume' b'coreldraw knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer.' b'' b'but when i use the windows accessory write, the printer prints square' b'boxes in place of the characters of the new font. yet, write does' b'display the font correctly on the screen.' b'' b'i looked through all the windows and laserjet manuals, but got nowhere.' b'all of them just make the statement that truetype fonts will print' b'exactly as you see them on the screen---so i assume windows knows that a font' b'has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that????' b'' b'appreciate any help....' b'' b"i assume you're using the driver available from cica (hp4-v108.zip)." b'bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel. click on the' b'"options" button brings up another screen of choices. change the "graphics' b'mode" from "hp-gl/2" to "raster" and check the box "print truetype as graphics' b'(this is only available when you choose "raster"). now you should be able to' b'print all your truetype fonts correctly. good luck.' b'' b'' b'lei shao' b''
