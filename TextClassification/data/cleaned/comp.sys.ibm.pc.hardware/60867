b'' b'' b'i have a 486sx25 computer with a mg seagate ide drive and a controler' b'built into the motherboard. i want to add a scsi drive (a quantum prodrive' b'425f mg formatted). i have no documentation at all and i need your' b'help!' b'' b'as i understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive. could you' b"please tell me if i'm right.." b'' b'1- buy a scsi contoler. which one? i know adaptec is good, but they are' b'kind of expensive. are there any good boards in the region? i want' b'it to be compatible with os2 and unix if possible. also, i have seen on' b'the net that there are scsi and scsi2 drives. is this true? does the' b'adapter need to be the same as the drive? what type of drive is the' b'quantum?' b'' b'2- connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power cable.' b'do i have to worry about the power supply? i think i have watts and' b"all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive." b'' b'3- setup the bios to recognize the drive as the second drive. what type' b"of drive is this? i don't have the numbers for this drive." b'' b'4- format and create partitions on the drive. do i use format or fdisk? i' b"think that ide drives can't be low-level formatted. is it the same with" b'scsi? how exactly does fdisk work? i have a reduced msdos manual' b'(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk. ideally, i would want' b'the drive partitioned in to two partitions d: and e: how do i do this?' b'' b"well that seems to be all. is there anythiing i'm forgetting?" b"any help is *really* appreciated, i'm lost..." b'' b'-eric' b''
