b'' b'' b' there are arabs in cabinet but look how long it took and to what' b' insignificant positions they are assigned! and this is based solely' b' on race not political belief or security as jewish members of the' b' same party have always been welcome just not their fellow arabs.' b'' b'first of all, the arab standing in any party, or as any party, is solely' b'dependent upon the amount of political power they can wield effectively.' b'' b'it is not a question of an individuals standing. when a party puts up an' b'arab for a cabinet post and that arab is rejected but the position is given' b'to a jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism.' b'would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with labour' b'coalitions?' b'' b'in the past, they have not been effective at garnering votes and forming' b'a single bloc in the knesset. on the few occasions when this was done,' b'some of the parties took stands that were extremist, and ineffect precluded' b'themselves from forming a coalition and participating in the cabinet.' b'' b'not their party them as *individuals*. even when they belong to nice' b'peaceful zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. arabs are' b'excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. it' b'sure looks like racism to me.' b'' b'arabs are excluded from cabinet, even when they do the things you' b'suggest, because they are arabs. unless of course you have a better' b'reason? i am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist jew' b'is less of a security risk than a leftist arab from the same party.' b'look at the present cabinet.' b'' b'joseph askew' b'' b'--' b'joseph askew, gauche and proud in the autumn stillness, see the pleiades,' b'disclaimer? sue, see if i care north of our tents, the sky must end somwhere,' b'actually, i rather like brenda beyond the pale, the river murmurs on.'
