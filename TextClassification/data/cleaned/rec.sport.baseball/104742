b'' b'' b"and finally, i'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw" b'their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike' b'to them, than because they have a great "eye"' b'' b"i'm not sure. i used to think this was true, but more and more i'm becoming" b"convinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical" b'ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the' b'chance to do it a lot.' b'' b"let's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether" b'they are power threats and whether they walk a lot:' b'' b'' b'\t\t\tpower\t\t\tno power' b'' b'\tpatient\t\tfrank thomas\t\tbrett butler' b'\t\t\tbarry bonds\t\tozzie smith' b'\t\t\tmark mcgwire\t\tcraig grebeck' b'\t\t\tbabe ruth\t\tmiller huggins' b'\t\t\tted williams\t\tbilly hamilton' b'\t\t\trickey henderson\teddie joost' b'\t\t\tjoe morgan\t\tmike hargrove' b'\t\t\t .\t\t\t b'\t\t\t .\t\t\t b'\t\t\t .\t\t\t b'' b'\timpatient\ternie banks\t\tozzie guillen' b'\t\t\tdave kingman\t\tshawon dunston' b'\t\t\tjoe carter\t\tandres thomas' b'\t\t\tgeorge bell\t\tjose lind' b'\t\t\tkirby puckett\t\tdevon white' b'' b'okay, i think we all agree that singles hitters should take a' b'strike or two and try to get on base any way they can.' b'' b'so the "no power/impatient" guys have no excuse.' b'the "no power/patient" guys are doing the right thing.' b'' b'now the "impatient/power" guys (how could you leave out the big cat?).' b'would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took' b'more pitches? perhaps, but i doubt it. if you tell joe carter' b'to go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but' b"he also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because" b'he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.' b'' b'the "patient/power" guys? joe morgan had a small strike zone and' b'rickey henderson has "a strike zone the size of hitler\'s heart"' b'so they get their walks based on the small zone.' b'' b'look at the other guys: thomas, bonds, mcgwire, ruth and williams. wow!' b'a lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe' b'walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.' b'the pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after' b'them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers' b'would rather nibble, go or and then get hurt.' b''
