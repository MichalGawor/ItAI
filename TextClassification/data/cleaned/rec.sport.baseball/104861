b'' b'i like the clark-williams-bonds order.' b'pitchers can only walk clark with outs (unlike last year).' b'' b'williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming' b'in the on-deck circle. since matt has a terrible batting eye,' b'this helps the giants a lot.' b'' b'when bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd' b'and then be driven in with a single by thompson, manwaring, or clayton.' b'' b"if you bat bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want" b'him to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of a' b'big inning.' b'' b'also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he' b'is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).' b'' b'the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the' b"bases infront of bonds... and i think that's a problem the" b'giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot.' b''
