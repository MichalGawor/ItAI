b'' b'' b"i heard somewhere (can't name the source) that tempest does not necessarily" b'pick-up just crts, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip. if' b'that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything' b'on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller. can anybody verify' b'or refute this?' b'' b'anything can be an emissions problem, right down to the video cable. given' b'the right equipment, you can pick the screen paint from the cable. but,' b'given any cable, you must know what is being sent through it to know the' b'format of the signal, as well as how many wires, etc.'
