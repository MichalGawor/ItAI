b'' b'jim haynes wants to know the following is a scam....' b'' b"there's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping" b'mall, offering free examinations. part of the process involves a' b'multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer-' b'sounding voice "digitize left psis" "digitize right psis" "digitize' b'c7" "please stand with spine in neutral position". i\'m wondering' b"whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voice" b'is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring something' b'that chiropractors think is useful to measure.' b'' b'earth to sci.med....if it looks like a duck...and quacks like a duck......' b'' b'this is a total scam. since the beginning of chiropraxis, the chiropractor has' b'tried to sell the subluxation as the problem and then sell themselves and' b'their adjustments as the solution. the chiropractic subluxation is a delusional' b'diagnosis and the adjustments of subluxations by extension constitute a' b'delusional medicine.' b'' b'the wide spectrum of chiropractic techniques all have their own methods for' b'detecting spinal demons and unique methodolgies for excorcizing them. the' b"computer approach is an attempt to 'sell with science' but this device is" b"nothing more than a 'high-tech' subluxation detector.....and in the end..." b"amazingly...it will show the potential 'patient' to suffer from...vs......" b'vertebral subluxation....the silent killer!' b'' b'john badanes, dc, ca' b'' b'' b'' b''
