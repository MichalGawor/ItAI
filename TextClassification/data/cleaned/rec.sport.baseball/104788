b'' b'the boston red sox lead the kc royals after innings.' b'' b'the sox are the only undefeated team in the al east after days.' b'' b'go jump in the lake you non-believers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' b'' b'' b'steve' b'' b'' b'as i have read this net the last few days, i am continually amazed at the' b'pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals. especially when it' b"comes down to saying that the bosox haven't a prayer. as a long time red sox" b'fan, i will simply say: the impossible dream year for those of you' b'with short memories. short lives, or both.' b'' b'to be a red sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism' b"from those who only follow 'the hot team'. this statement is supported based" b"on the increased number of 'brave woofers' out on the net. a true fan of a" b'team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean' b'years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.' b'' b'yeah, so what if buckner let a roller go through his legs in who cares if' b'clemens told cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower. the' b'fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans' b'supported them. now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of' b'detracters come from all over. so what! let them play and we will see what' b'happens come september. the red sox may not be that good, but they are certainly' b'not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the world series, after all,' b'remember the mets? who would have given them a chance to even make it that' b'far, let alone beat baltimore.' b'' b"let's face it, baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than football" b'and basketball. because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what' b'the outcome will be over the course of games.' b'' b'===============================================================================' b'| your reputation. b'+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+' b'| i bike, therefore i am! go red sox! go celtics! b'| go seahawks! go sonics! b'===============================================================================' b''
