b'' b'' b'sorry to insult your homestate, but coming from where i do, wisconsin' b'is _very_ backwards. i was never able to understand that people actually' b'held such bigoted and backwards views until i came here.' b'' b'i have never been to wisconsin, though i have been to' b'neighbor minnesota. being a child of the middle atlantic (ny, nj, pa)' b'i found that there were few states in the provences that stood' b"out in this youngster's mind: california, texas, and florida to" b'name the most obvious three. however, both minnesota and wisconsin' b'stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics. both have' b'always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states.' b'and my recent trip to minnestoa last summer served to support that' b"state's reputation. my guess is that wisconsin is probably the" b'same. at least that was the impression the people of minnesota left' b'with me about their neighbors.' b'' b'the only question in my head about wisconsin, though, is' b'whether or not there is a cause-effect relationship between' b'cheese and serial killers b'' b'-jim halat'
