b'' b"i watched the final inning of bosio's no-hitter with several people at" b'work. after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the' b'middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he' b"wouldn't have had time to throw riles out. yet, the throw beat riles" b'by about two steps. i wonder how many others who watched the final out' b'think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.' b'does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? and' b'if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an' b"error or a hit? (judging from bosio's grimace when the ball bounced" b'past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) whether' b'vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'--------------------------' b'phil brown b'--------------------------'
