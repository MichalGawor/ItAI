b'' b'' b' the "apostate church" of revelation most likely refers to the 1st century' b' jews who rejected their messiah and had him crucified. john refers to them' b'' b" i'm afraid not. it refers to the church that christ founded. many, many" b' times he warns that the church will fall away into heresy as do the' b' apostles. for an example look at the parables in matthew they' b" refer to 'the kingdom of heaven' (the church) and the process of how" b' they will be corrupted.' b'' b'sorry, but i think this interpretation of the matthew parables is' b'nonsense. i.e.,' b'' b" 'yeast' *always* stands for sin/corruption/heresy. for example 'beware" b" of the yeast of the pharisees'. b'' b'matthew explains that by "leaven of the pharisees" jesus was simply' b'referring to their teaching; not sin/corruption/heresy.' b'' b'jesus gaves his apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that' b'the gates of hell would not prevail against his church.' b'' b'--' b'tom albrecht'
