b'' b'the real question here in my opinion is what motorola processors running system' b'7 on a mac are comparable to what intel processors running windows on a pc? i' b'recall there being a conversation here that a running windows benchmarks' b"at about the same speed as 25mhz in system i don't know if that is" b'true, but i would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this.' b'' b'-david' b'' b'that seems about right. i have a mac iisi with 64k cache card running' b'system my roommate has a 486sx/25 running windows and from' b"what i've seen, my iisi is faster in some operations. in others, they are" b"comparable...but keep in mind i'm strictly speaking of operations on the" b'desktop level of windows and system not actual computational speed' b'in other programs...'
