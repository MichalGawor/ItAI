b'' b'' b"(attempting to define 'objective morality'):" b'' b" i'll take a wild guess and say freedom is objectively valuable. i base" b' this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly' b' of their freedom (so that their every act was contrary to their volition),' b' almost all would want to complain.' b'' b'so long as you keep that "almost" in there, freedom will be a' b"mostly valuable thing, to most people. that is, i think you're really" b'saying, "a real big lot of people agree freedom is subjectively valuable' b'to them". that\'s good, and a quite nice starting point for a moral' b'system, but it\'s not universal, and thus not "objective".' b'' b' therefore i take it that to assert or' b' believe that "freedom is not very valuable", when almost everyone can see' b' that it is, is every bit as absurd as to assert "it is not raining" on' b' a rainy day.' b'' b"it isn't in sahara." b'' b'--' b'disclaimer?
