to learn you must accept that you don't know" b" |something, right-o. but to learn you must _accept_ something i don't" b' |know, why? this is not the way i prefer to learn. it is unwise to' b' |merely swallow everything you read. suppose i write a book telling' b' |how the great invisible pink unicorn (tm) has helped me in my' b" |daily problems, would you accept this, since you can't know whether" b' |it is true or not?' b' b'' b' no one asks you to swallow everything, in fact jesus warns against it. but let' b' me ask you a question. do you beleive what you learn in history class, or for' b" that matter anything in school. i mean it's just what other people have told" b" you and you don't want to swallow what others say. right b'' b'well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the' b'very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there' b'was a military conflict in vietnam years ago, then there is a supernatural' b'diety who wants us to live a certain way. the fact that jesus warned against' b'it means nothing. *i* warn against it too. big deal.' b'' b'' b' the life death, and resurection of christ is documented historical fact.' b'' b'this is not true. the first two choices here (life and death) are scantily' b'documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the bible, and' b'that is totally circular. perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or' b"one's ignorance. someone else will address this i'm sure, and refer you to" b'plenty of documentation...' b'' b'as much' b' as anything else you learn. how do you choose what to believe and what not to?' b" i could argue that george washington is a myth. he never lived because i don't" b' have any proof except what i am told. however all the major events of the life' b' of jesus christ were fortold hundreds of years before him. neat trick uh?' b'' b'how is this? there is nothing more disgusting than christian attempts to' b'manipulate/interpret the old testament as being filled with signs for the' b'coming of christ. every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is' b'autmoatically interpreted as the cross. what a miscarriage of philology.' b'' b'' b' there is no way to get into a sceptical heart. you can not say you have given a' b' sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have. you must trust, not just go' b" to church and participate in it's activities. were you ever willing to die for what" b' you believed?' b'' b'well, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get' b'into us. here we have the irreconcilable difference: christians glorify' b'exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge.' b'if i am lucky one day and i happen to be thinking of god at the same time my' b'enkephalins go up, then i may associate this as a sign of god (it will "feel"' b'right, and i will trust without knowing). maybe. religosity does not seem to' b'be anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of' b'a sudden affliction...' b'i believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were' b'not. the question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or' b'healthy morality. it would seem not to be. the same thing could reflect' b'fanaticism, for example, and is any case an expression of simple selfishness.' b'--' b'' b'--adam' b'' b'================================================================================' b'| adam john cooper\t|\t"verily, often have i laughed at the weaklings b'| 696-7521\t|\t who thought themselves good simply because b'================================================================================' b'| "understand one another?
