b'' b'doug-- actually, if memory serves, the atlas is an outgrowth of the old' b'titan icbm...' b'' b"nope, you're confusing separate programs. atlas was the first-generation" b'us icbm; titan i was the second-generation one; titan ii, which all the' b'titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy icbm. there' b'was essentially nothing in common between these three programs.' b'' b'(yes, *three* programs. despite the similarity of names, titan i and' b"titan ii were completely different missiles. they didn't even use the" b'same fuels, never mind the same launch facilities.)' b'' b"if so, there's probably quite a few old pads, albeit in need" b'of some serious reconditioning. still, being able to buy the turf and' b'pad (and bunkers, including prep facility) at midwest farmland prices' b'strikes me as pretty damned cheap.' b'' b"sorry, the titan silos (a) can't handle the titan launchers with their" b"large srbs, (b) can't handle *any* sort of launcher without massive" b'violations of normal range-safety rules (nobody cares about such things' b'in the event of a nuclear war, but in peacetime they matter), and (c) were' b'scrapped years ago.'
