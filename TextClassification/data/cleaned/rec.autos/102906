b'' b'' b'while not exactly a service incident, i had a similar experience recently' b'when i bought a new truck.' b'' b'i had picked out the vehicle i wanted and after a little haggling we' b'agreed on a price. i wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax' b"and license and told them i'd be back that evening to pick up the truck." b'when i returned, i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could' b'get to me. when i finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he' b'started adding up the numbers. he then discovered that they had' b'miscalculated the tax license by about b'' b'this seems to be a popular scam with dealers. last month my brother bought' b'a new audi series quatro from a local dealer. they came back with the' b'final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself. there happened to' b'be an extra tagged on under the tax part. he pointed out their error' b'and asked them to re-think their addition. they came back with the right' b'price the next time.'
