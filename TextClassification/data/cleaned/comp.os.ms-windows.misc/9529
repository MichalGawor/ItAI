b'' b' hi,' b'' b" well i'm searching for the ms-windows logo, u know the picture when u" b' start windows, in some suitable grafics-format, like gif or jpg,...' b'' b' c:\\windows\\system\\vgalogo.rle. if my memory serves me correctly,' b' *.rle is a compressed *.bmp format.' b'' b' an is readable by wingif, paintshop pro, paint, and god knows how' b'many other programs.' b'' b"that isn't enough to change your windows startup logo. vgalogo.rle is not" b'needed after you have installed windows. it is incorporated as a part of' b'win.com.' b'to make a new win.com, you have to concatinate three files together,' b'using the /b option for a binary concatonation. i beleive it is' b'' b'copy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle mywin.com' b'' b'make sure you backup your win.com file in anotehr directory before you do this' b'-- i absent-mindedly typed win.com instead of mywin.com and had to resinstall' b'windows!' b'anyway, substitute whatever .rle file you want. the win.cnf has the' b'info needed to start windows (think of it as a bootstrap) and vgalogo.vga has' b"video information. just make sure that the .rle file doesn't tip the whole" b'com file size over the 64k limit of a .com file!' b'so anyway, i use mywin.com to startup ms windows. now instead of that' b'annoying micro$oft advertisment, i have the joker (yes, from batman) taking' b'yoru picture from the screen, saying "smile!" also a little bit of text:' b'"micro$oft windows: the world\'s first commercially sucessful virus." i added' b'that because of the frequency of crashes. <grin' b'' b'rob' b'' b'__ \t\t\t\t b'/ --\t\t--===---\t a post by b'\\__/ ---------\t\t\t rob mohns b'i had no water, so\t vax.clarku.edu b'i drowned in sand.\t b'| b'\\|/\t\t b'__\\\\\\|/____________|_______________\\//___\\\\|_|/________\\|/_________'
