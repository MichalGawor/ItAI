b'' b'does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two in' b"combination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of" b'available water? i had kind of an odd experience on a group hike' b'recently, becoming dehyrated after about hours of rigorous' b'hiking despite having brought gallons of water (c. liters).' b'i drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was' b"dehydrated. i don't think general physical condition was an issue," b'since i was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general' b'stamina, so far as i could tell.' b'' b'it may be that i just plain need more water than most people. but i am' b'wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things.' b'i took a couple of primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma' b'(24 mg. ephedrine, mg. theophylline). i gather that both those' b"drugs are diuretics. so now i'm wondering: does that mean they can" b"reduce the body's ability to utilize available water? would it be a" b'particularly stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather' b'exercise? (i always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, but' b"that wasn't the case yesterday.)"
