b'' b'when constructing active filters, odd values of resistor are often required' b'(i.e. something like a k ohm resistor).(it seems best to choose common' b'capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded).' b'' b'is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such' b'a resistance, given fixed resistors of the standard values per decade?.(1,' b'1.2,1.5,1.8,2.2,3.3 etc it is a common enough problem, yet i cant' b'recall seing a program that tells that rx+ry//rz gives rq, starting with' b'q and finding prefered values x,y and z.' b'' b'' b'cheers' b'ian h' b''
