b'' b'adam, i just finished a study on this, not only looking at the' b'prophecies themselves, but where they were fulfilled. while going only' b'through the ot, i found references. after starting to show their' b'fulfillment, i found out that i had missed some, so needless to say i' b'cannot post them here. however, the study i did i intend to publish (i' b'am in the process of organizing and showing the fulfillments, then i' b'will be ready to write and send it to a publisher). with any luck' b'(and/or free time) i should have it finally done sometime around' b'september (i hope).' b'' b'joe fisher'
