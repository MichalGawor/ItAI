b'' b'' b'hello all,' b' i have a question about satan. i was taught a long time ago' b'that satan was really an angel of god and was kicked out of heaven' b"because he challenged god's authority. the problem is, i cannot" b'find this in the bible. is it in the bible? if not, where did it' b'originate?' b'' b'wondering,' b'eddie' b'' b'the quick answer: revelation b'' b'"and there was war in heaven. michael and his angels fought against' b'the dragon and his angels who fought back. but he [the dragon] was' b'not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. the great' b'dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent, called the devil and' b'satan, who leads the whole world astray. he was hurled down to the' b'earth, and his angels with him."' b'' b'the earlier part of chapter deals (very symbolically) with why' b'satan rose up in battle against michael and the good angels in the' b'first place.' b'' b'hope this clears it up.' b'- mike walker'
