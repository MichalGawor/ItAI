b'' b'' b"you've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide." b'bosnian muslims are slavic in ethnicity. they speak serbo-croatian. but' b'there is a christo-slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are christian' b'and anyone who converted to islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by' b'changing religion.' b'' b'' b'"muslim" in ex-yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion. in fact, not' b'all muslims in b-h are followers of islam. therefore, there do (did?)' b'exist in ex-yugoslavia "christian muslims." tito defined the muslim' b'nation constitutionally, adding muslims to serbs, croats, and slovenes,' b'the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the' b'end of wwi. in addition, tito added two other nations constitutionally:' b'montenegrins, and makedonijans.' b'' b'nations had the right of secession, but republics did not. so, "muslim"' b'is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who' b'differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in b-h. it was not' b'a "christo-slavic" ideology that made a muslim nation in yugoslavia, it' b'was the "atheist communist" ideology of tito. before tito, there was' b'no muslim nation in yugoslavia.' b'' b'the war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war. it is a' b'civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns' b'instead of pens. the croat, muslim, and serb political leaders *all*' b'chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and' b'peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.' b'' b'-nick' b''
