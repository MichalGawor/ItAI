b'' b'' b'hello,' b'' b'i am testing a port of x11r5 to coherent, a unix clone os for intel architecture' b'machines. i am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple' b'terminal emulator program).' b'' b'the problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the' b'server for display, one at a time. the characters appear to be too closely' b'spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the' b'rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the' b'rightmost edge of the second character, and so on. it looks like there is an' b'invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous' b'character. there is no problem between the characters when the shell returns' b'a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual' b'characters.' b'' b'if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where i should look to' b'find it, it would be much appreciated.' b'' b'regards and thanks, jon dhuse.' b'' b'--' b'intel corp. ch3-69 phone: b'5000 w. chandler blvd. any opinions expressed are my own,' b"chandler, az not my employer's." b''
