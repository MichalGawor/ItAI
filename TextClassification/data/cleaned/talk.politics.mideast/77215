b'' b'' b'| in the ny times, on sunday, may in an article on somalia, a' b'| reporter writes:' b'| b'| but last year, iran quietly took over four islands belonging' b'| to the united arab emirates and deported their people, with hardly a' b'| protest from the united states. b'| b'| does anyone know what this is referring to? i seem to have missed it.' b'| (spiked, no doubt. b'' b'| there was something in the nyt and other sources about this for a few' b'| days. it is an ongoing border disupute, and when the iranians kicked' b'| out the uae people it was briefly reported (this was many moons ago).' b"| i don't recall reading of any public us comment; if it were a strong" b'| protest i probably would have seen it.' b'' b'those islands would be abu musa, and the greater and lesser tunbs, i presume.' b"i don't know about a fourth. the latter two islands belong to iran and so" b'' b'according to the ny times, the islands "belong[] to the united arab' b'emirates."' b'' b'could not be "taken over". the major row is over abu musa which has been' b'jointly administered by iran and uae. the dispute goes back to the early' b"1970's when britain evacuated the island and iran under the shah reclaimed" b'the island which had historical ties to iran. no british objection was' b'raised at that time.' b'' b'it is my understanding that uae residents of abu musa are currently free to' b'travel to and from the island and that iran is desiring diplomatic resolution' b'of the dispute.' b'' b'why is it, then, that when the british, iranians and uae refer to' b'occupied territory, they mean territory in dispute in israel but not' b'in their own affairs?' b'' b'--' b'american-occupied new york have replaced jimmy carter as the' b'my opinions only employer has no opinions. standard of a failed president.'
