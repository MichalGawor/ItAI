b'' b'' b'it troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support' b'the doctrine of original sin. this is primarily a catholic doctrine, with no' b'other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism. b"if you read all of ezekiel you will see that god doesn't hold us guilty" b"for anyone else's sins. so we can have no original guilt from adam." b'' b'this neatly eliminates the need for a savior and "proves" that we can be' b'saved by works alone! if we have no original sin, then it is possible for' b'us to save ourselves by not sinning. i understand the reasoning behind your' b'argument, but it leads to sheer folly. original sin is the reason we need' b'faith to be saved.' b'' b'alan terlep\t\t\t\t "...and the scorpion says, \'it\'s' b'oakland university, rochester, mi\t\tin my nature.\'"'
