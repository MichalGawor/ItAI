b'' b'george william herbert sez:' b'' b'hmm. billion, lesse... i can probably launch tons to leo at' b'$200 million, in five years, which gives about tons to the lunar' b'surface one-way. say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its' b'fuel, a bigger mercury or something (might get that as low as two' b"tons), leaving fifteen tons for a one-man habitat and a year's supplies?" b'gee, with that sort of mass margins i can build the systems off' b'the shelf for about another hundred million tops. that leaves' b"about million profit. i like this idea let's see" b'if you guys can push someone to make it happen b'' b"i like your optimism, george. i don't know doots about raising that kind" b'of dough, but if you need people to split the work and the $700m, you just' b'give me a ring living alone for a year on the moon sounds horrid, but' b"i'd even try that, if i got a bigger cut. b'' b'-tommy mac' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'tom mcwilliams wk as the radius of vision increases,' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------'
