b'' b' a friend of mine has a very severe cause of jiggers b' for over a year now they cause him a lot of pain.' b'' b" i recently read (i don't know where) about a possible" b' cure for jiggers. does anyone have any information on' b" this? i can't remember the name of the treatment, or" b' where i read it.' b'' b'' b"i'll probably get flamed for this, but when i was a kid we would go to" b'my uncles cabin on middle bass island on lake erie. we always came home' b'with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had' b'burrowed into the skin). my mother would paint the bumps with clear' b'finger nail polish. this was repeated daily for about a week or so. the' b'application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of' b'the skin. all i can say is it worked for us. one word of caution' b'though. putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.' b'' b'(if i do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me' b'toast.:)' b'' b'--' b'_______________________________________________________________________________' b''
