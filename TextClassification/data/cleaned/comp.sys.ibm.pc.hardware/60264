b'' b' i am looking at purchasing a system from zeos computers. i would appreciate' b' if people could give me some feedback about the quality of their products and' b' customer service along with any advice about which systems people like.' b' thanks in advance.' b'' b'' b'i bought a 386dx33 system a little over years ago, and was satisfied with' b'everything about zeos. that computer went off to grad school with my son and' b'i replaced it with a 486dx2/66 pkg mbhd, 16mb ram) with diamond viper,' b'128k level cache, and tower upgrades, delete the ctx monitor. i got a' b'17" hp d1193a monitor employee purchase. this is a *great* system, fast,' b'quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up. tech support seems' b'busier now than years ago. i called with a configuration question, and' b"they called back hours later with the right answer. i think there's a" b'slight premium over gateway prices, but imho zeos is worth it. btw they' b"have enough lines that i've never gotten a busy signal calling sales," b'customer service, or tech support. now, you usually wait or minutes to' b'talk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.' b'--' b'al devilbiss'
