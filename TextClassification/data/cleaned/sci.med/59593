b'' b'gt hi, we are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull' b'' b'you could do high resolution ct (computed tomographic) scanning of' b'the skull. many ct scanners have an algorithm to do 3-d' b'reconstructions in any plane you want. if you did reconstructions' b'every degrees or so in all planes, you could use the resultant' b'images to create user-controlled animation.' b'---' b''
