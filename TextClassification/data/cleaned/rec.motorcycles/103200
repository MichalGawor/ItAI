b'' b'| riding to work last week via hwy from suisun, to i-80, i was pulled over by' b'| a chp black and white by the gas station by jameson canyon road. the' b'| officer stated "...it <looked like you were going kinda fast coming down' b'| highway you <must have been going at least or i just said okay,' b'| and did not agree or disagree to anything he said.' b'|' b'' b'1) the next time you get stoped by a cop, never never never admit to anything.' b'' b"2) don't volunteer any information." b'' b'3) when a retoracle question is ask by the cop, like "...it <looked like you were going kinda fast coming down highway you <must have been going at least or the correct reponse is to deny it. this technique is employed by police to help establish guilt, especially when times out of he/she is not sure who was doing the speeding. if the cop is unsure this may be the difference of him letting you off the hook or getting the tissue.' b'' b'hope this helps for next time.' b'' b'steven bakalis'
