b'' b'(note: this is not about the l.a. or ny times)' b'' b'a few times a year, a funny thing happens: the bike engine runs' b'perfectly. completely smooth. not that it runs poorly normally, but' b'on these days, it is exceptional. my theory is that the air density' b'and moisture content of the air are such that i get complete' b'combustion. needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.' b'' b'the mood lasted for about miles. heading north on the b'freeway, about a mile or two south of the my throttle stopped' b'responding.... and i was between lanes. nothing to do but make' b'my way over lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then' b'by pushing. at least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did' b'not mind stopping for me.' b'' b'turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my mikuni hs40' b'carb. i keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws' b'tight on a bike, but i never thought that i had to do that' b'on the screws inside of a carb. at least it was roadside' b'fixable and i was on my way in hardly any time.' b'____________________________________________________________________________' b"death is life's way of telling you you've been fired r. geis" b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'kd6laa, marc, arrl, platypus qrp-arpci, naswa, lwca, rcma (cala905)' b'transaction technology, inc., santa monica, ca'
