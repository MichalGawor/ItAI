b'' b'' b'' b"i've been following discussions about the delta clipper program, and i" b'have one small question. as i understand it, the dc-x derived orbital' b'vehicle (dc-y is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, not' b'completely nose-first. so why is the dc-y look symmetric in every drawing' b"i've seen? i would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like" b'wingless orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on the' b'top side. can anybody explain?' b'' b'- ken kobayashi' b'' b'--' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'ken kobayashi
