b'' b'' b'hello,' b'' b' does anyone know how to take out the bolt under the engine' b'compartment? should i turn clockwise or counter? i tried any kind' b'of lubricants, wd-40,etc, but i still failed!' b' do you think i can use a electric drill( change to a suitable' b'bit to turn it out? if i can succeed, can i re-tighten it not too' b'tight, is it safe without oil leak?' b'' b"you shouldn't need any power tools to undo it, an electric drill" b"probably won't give you much extra torque anyway. wd40 will help" b'things that are seized due to rust but this is unlikely for a drain' b'plug. you should be able to undo it with a spanner. when it' b'loosens, it will probably become very loose and you will bash your' b'knuckles on the underside of the car this is the price you must' b'pay for doing you own work.' b'' b"no, that's the price you pay for not knowing how to use a" b'wrench. you want to pull the wrench towards you, away from' b"painful knuckle splitting hard things. if you can't pull it" b'because things are in the way, push it with an open hand.' b'' b'i find this method much better myself, too, although i do really' b'hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my' b'hand both come crashing into my face. after coming to, which is' b'about minutes later, i change my clothes (because by this time' b'all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck' b'down about tylenol to ease the pain. later in the day i then' b'proceed with refilling the engine oil.' b'' b"it's just crazy how i try and change the oil on my cars in one" b'weekend---i go through about bottles of tylenol and bags of ice.' b'' b'john'
