b'' b'' b'' b'i personally like the looks of the impala ss. the caprice was definately' b'weird looking until this year when they made the rear wheel openings look' b"more like a normal car, but the impala impresses me. gm can't exactly shove" b"the lt1 in everything they make, you know, only the bigger stuff. i'd like" b'to see it next in a series pickup. that would be a hot setup.' b' b'' b'what about in a full size blazer as well? would this engine have the gobs' b'of torque necessary for off-roading? if so, this would be even better than' b'the syclone.' b'' b"well, an lt1 blazer wouldn't come close to a gmc typhoon in speed, i think its" b'too heavy. as it is right now, the normal 210hp engine has plenty of' b"power for a full size blazer. of course, i'm not saying gm shouldn't put the" b'lt1 in it it seems like they have a real winner with that engine. why' b'spend so much more money into getting a valve dohc v8 when you can take' b'an lt1? it even seems to get pretty good gas mpg (for a that is.)' b'' b'' b'[talking about impala ss]' b"will this be in the 4-door caprice body? i'm just curious if chevy is" b'trying to resurrect their 2-door muscle cars, or to compete with the european' b'"super sedans."' b'' b'yeah, it\'s a flat black, lowered door caprice riding on aluminum rims and' b'eagle gs-c tires. the rest of the car is basically a caprice ltz (read:' b'plush police package) with horsepower.' b'' b"i heard that chevy is resurrecting the monte carlo but that's going to get" b'their dohc v6 and not the lt1.' b'' b'jon dunn<' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------'
