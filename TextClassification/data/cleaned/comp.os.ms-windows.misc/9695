b'' b'' b' dear friend,' b' the risc means "reduced instruction set computer". the risc usually has' b' small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase' b' the clock rate to have a high performance. you can read some books about' b' computer architecture for more information about risc.' b'' b'risc used to mean "reduced instruction set computer", true. they' b'still use the same acronym, but only to be familiar. what risc really' b'means is a recently-designed cpu. b'' b'in general, most risc cpus are like this:' b'' b'a large number or more) of general-purpose registers' b'a fixed instruction size, usually bits' b'an instruction may make only one memory reference' b'memory references must be aligned' b'there are delayed branches (branch after the next instruction) or' b"a target prediction bit (probably will/won't branch)" b'instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction' b'stream' b'--' b'os/2 will do for me until amigados for the comes along...'
