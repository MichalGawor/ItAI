b'' b'dear netters:' b'' b'' b'i am looking for c source code to test if a 3d point lies within a' b'' b'concave polyhadra. i have read a few articles about this and know' b'' b'that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. both' b'' b'' b'ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. so i wonder if there exists' b'' b'public domain source code for this.' b'' b"another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting" b'' b'which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces' b'' b'consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used' b'(m. tamminen, et. al., "ray-casting and block model conversion' b'using a spatial index". computer-aided-designs. b'but the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their' b'normal pointing outside of polyhedra. how this could be done in practice b'i have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. how could i ensure their' b'normals pointing outside the polyhedra the paper mentioned above assumed' b'this is already the case.' b'' b'' b'i have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden' b'line removal. it says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing' b'' b'toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". again how to make' b'sure b'' b'' b'any pointers are welcome b'' b'' b'yaohong jiang' b"queen's university" b'kingston, ont.' b''
