b'' b'hi,' b'would someone like to post a comparative analysis (quantitative' b'measures -hp etc and more so the qualitative feel of how they compare' b'for the driving feel, handling, noise, responsiveness etc) for the' b"saab 900/9000's and the bmw series." b'any comments on just comparing the with the re: handling.' b"i take it that the saabs and bmw's are comparable for reliability and" b'all that....would be nice if flaming wars could be avoided and' b'folks just post their experiences b'' b"i had a saab turbo, and now have a bmw 325is" b'' b'there is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of' b'engineering. the bmw wins hands down. after years i was sick and tired' b'of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the saab. the 6-year' b'old bmw is still as sweet as it was new.' b'' b"but i see you are posting from western ma. bmw's **suck** in the snow." b'i have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and i' b'still try to avoid driving in the snow. i happily took the saab through' b'blizzard conditions without a worry. i would say this is the single design' b'flaw in the bmw.' b'' b'--' b'intranet, inc\t\t\t\t\t617-527-7020'
