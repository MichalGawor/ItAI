b'' b'i would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged' b'couple become "married" in god\'s eyes? some say that if the two have' b'publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to god, and' b'are unswervingly committed to one another (i realize this is a subjective' b"qualifier) they are married/joined in god's sight." b'' b'suppose they are unable to get before the altar right at the current time' b'because of purely logistical reasons beyond their control. what do you' b'think about this?' b'' b'post or e-mail me with general responses. if you need clarification as to' b'what i am asking, please e-mail.' b'' b'thanks and god bless!' b'' b'============================================' b'robert m. anderson iii'
