b'' b'' b'in most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish,' b'but there are certainly exceptions. if you write a paper which includes' b'sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is' b'classified. as i understand the law, nuclear weapons design is' b'_automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself. i believe you' b'are then not allowed to read your own paper.' b'' b'this has now been thrown out by the courts. (the "progressive" case.)' b'' b'a less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are' b'about to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you' b'broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman. the charge' b'is interfering with a police officer, which is quite similar what you would' b'be doing by reverse engineering the clipper chip.' b'' b'this is outright illegal. it does violate the first amendment. if you' b'would, give a case in which your "speed trap" example has been upheld by' b'the courts.' b'--' b'my opinions are my own, and do not represent those of my employer.'
