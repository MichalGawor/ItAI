b'' b'you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational' b'prices.' b'' b'i would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices!' b'i went for a retailer, actually mail order (cda computers), because its price' b'was better thant the campus computer store. i found out why later on when i' b'tried to get a repair done at an apple registered repair center the cpu was a' b'resale. the serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard' b'number (probably from cda computers). consequently, the apple repair man could' b'not do any warrenty repairs. so i ended up with just a 90day warrenty from cda' b'over the apple 12month warrenty. boy, was i pi**ed! moral of the story, caveat' b'emptor.' b'' b'apple does not authorise sales through mail order. as a result mail order' b'companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.' b'' b'this market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have' b'more machines than they can sell. they come into this state of affairs' b'by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better' b'wholsale price from apple. in either case they often obscure the serial' b'nunber to protect their identity. as a result the warranty is void.' b'' b'you may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.' b'' b'i should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices' b'thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer' b'cost. as a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs' b'and trimming margins. unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well.' b'the lowest prices i have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest' b'prices available from authorised local dealers.' b'' b'they are even further away from educational prices.' b'' b'-erik speckman'
