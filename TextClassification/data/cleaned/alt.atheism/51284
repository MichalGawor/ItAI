b'' b'' b'' b'yesterday, i got the chance to hear kurt vonnegut speak at the' b'university of new hampshire. vonnegut succeeded isaac asimov as the' b'(honorary?) head of the american humanist association. (vonnegut is' b"an atheist, and so was asimov) before asimov's funeral, vonnegut stood up" b'and said about asimov, "he\'s in heaven now," which ignited uproarious' b'laughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time' b'of the funeral)' b'' b'"it\'s the funniest thing i could have possibly said' b'to a room full of humanists," vonnegut said at yesterday\'s lecture.' b'' b'if vonnegut comes to speak at your university, i highly recommend' b"going to see him even if you've never read any of his novels. in my opinion," b"he's the greatest living humorist. (greatest living humanist humorist as well)" b'' b'' b'peace,' b'' b'dana'
