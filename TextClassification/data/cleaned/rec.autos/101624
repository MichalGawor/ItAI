b'' b"i can't imagine any civic or saturn owners flex'n there egos in stop light" b'races. it generates as much excitement as two nerds challenging each other' b'in a game of one-on-one basketball!!' b'' b'the sl2 does in about note that this is closer to a than' b"to a paseo or storm (pseudo-sporty cars). that's a ridiculous" b'comparison, i know, but the point is that saturns (and high-end civics,' b'for that matter) accelerate just fine, in fact better than most' b'unimproved "muscle" cars of the 60s; hp is great, but tied to b"tons, it just doesn't go that quick. saturns, on the other hand, use b'hp tied to lbs with some short gearing to move very quickly off the' b'line. anyway....' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'while your time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, i saw' b"the pbs motorweek show clock a 5-speed sl2 at seconds. i'm sure that most" b'sl2 owners will be very lucky to get this speed, but seconds is still' b'astonishingly fast for a small 4-door. a new civic ex runs about seconds' b"0-60, if i'm not mistaken. most cars in this class are lucky to be in the" b'9-second range.' b'' b'' b'mihir shah' b''
