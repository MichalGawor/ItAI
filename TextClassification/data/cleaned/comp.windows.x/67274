b'' b'i was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system' b'that has a color hardcopy unit:' b'' b'xwd xwud -display hostname:0.0' b'' b'i had tested it with some simple windows like the openwindows file manager,' b'and it worked fine, but when i tried it with a more complex (larger) image,' b'the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault. i tried it without the pipe,' b"by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud" b"and got the same error from xwud. if i had to guess, it seems like it's" b'running out of memory, but this happened on a sparc with megs, meg' b'swap space, and only one user with minimal activity. the file was about mb.' b'' b'this verion of xwd/xwud was supplied with the sun openwindows distribution' b'which i believe corresponds to x11 r4.' b'' b'any ideas? thanks in advance.' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'dave humes johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------------'
