b'' b'' b"a friend of mine recently got such a serial card. i'll have to" b"ask him to verify the details, but as i recall, he paid it's" b'made by stb, it has (or was it ports, and it supports the at' b"irqs in addition to the convention ones. i'm sure of the" b'last, because he had trouble finding comm software that would allow' b'him to override the "standard" irq assignments.' b'' b'unfortunately there a *lot* of such software. i also find it to be' b'the case that the majority of the software that is bad in this regard' b'is commercial software. way too many commercial packages are very' b'poorly written. but then most of the programs in ms-dos are crap, such' b'as the print command tsr that locks up your system for long periods of' b'time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick.' b'' b'back to comm software... i find success with telix (my com3 at 3e8/5' b'works ok on telix).' b'--' b'| right wing conservative capitalists are out to separate you from your money b'| left wing liberal do gooders are out to separate you from everything else!! b'+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+'
