b'' b'' b'' b'i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (vs.' b'a blank screen) by monitoring the r,g, and b outputs of a graphics' b'card. it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at' b'65 mhz, which would mean detecting a ns pulse. it should also be' b'able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about mv)' b'and a dim screen (say, around mv). oh yes, it also needs to be' b'cheap.' b'' b'my first circuit was a dismal failure. i used compariators; each' b'compariator had the input going to one of the guns, the input' b'went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).' b'' b'the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. i' b'needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the' b'compariators, so i could have a whole screen full of text, but my' b'circuit would not detect it.' b'' b'the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then' b'the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen. in' b'fact the difference between completely black and completely white is' b'only mv. i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the' b'video signals to make this work.' b'' b'there are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require' b'split supplies. i would need to replace my quad compariator' b'with three compariators, and create a whole new power supply' b'circuit.' b'' b'at this point, i think what i need is some sort of transistor' b'circuit. transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...' b'' b'unfortunately, i am way out of my league when it comes to designing' b'transistor circuits, so i am appealing to the net for help. any' b'ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly' b'appreciated.' b'' b'oh yes, i only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so' b"i don't need a fast response time at all, however, i haven't found a" b'way to take advantage of that fact.' b'' b'thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. of course,' b'you will have my undying gratitude.' b'' b'' b'steve verity' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'..................................................+ b'steve verity ...maxed on midi
