b'' b"i've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and" b'that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the' b'greater volume. my internist, who diagnosed my av block, slow heart rate' b"and pvc's, told me something different. she says that heart rate is" b'associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its' b'size. exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the' b'effects are unrelated except for their common source. the av block, she' b'asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable even when' b"exercise is dicontinued. pvc's are also common in runners." b'' b'so my ekg puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart' b"patients. isn't that strange, though? are there any not-so-beneficial" b"aspects to athlete's heart? is it all good?" b'' b'not worried, just curious,' b'-larry c.'
