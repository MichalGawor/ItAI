b'' b'' b'the situation: running a fortran executable that creats an xterm. an option' b'in the menu contained in the xterm runs a fortran subroutine that creats' b'a tektronics-mode xterm for displaying some graphics. typing a <ret while' b'the tektronics-mode xterm (future reference to this will be "tek-term") is' b'active makes the xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus' b"to the xterm (i'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the" b'tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the tek-term stays on top of' b"xterm. if what i'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)" b'' b'the xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.' b'' b'subsequent selections from the xterm of the menu item that displays graphics' b'highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move' b'the tek-term to the top. if the tek-term has been iconized to conserve' b'screen space, it stays an icon.' b'' b'' b'the desired behavior: one of two options b'' b'1. whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the' b'inactive one.' b'' b'2. whenever the tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon' b'but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher' b'level than the xterm.' b'' b'what i think i need: a means of specifying that a xterm or tek-term will' b'be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a xterm and tek-term.' b"these commands, would, i'd guess, need to be in the fortran or in the" b'command that starts up the xterm and tek-term.' b'' b'other information: all this is taking place on a vt-1300 (a dec dumb' b'x-windows terminal) connected to a vax running vms and motif.' b'' b"thanks for your time. if you've got any words of wisdom (other than" b'"give up" please send email to' b'' b'' b''
