b'' b'i am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaust' b'for my bmw 320i. so far, i have found a pacesetter exhaust for b'and an ansa exhaust for (canadian funds). i was wondering if anyone' b'could tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible' b'exhausts that i may be interested in. my main priorities are a decent horse' b'power increase and a nice low note to go along with that added power.' b'i was also thinking of looking into both remus and leistritz exhausts.has' b'anyone got anything to say about these? i am mainly looking for the muffler' b'only but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit i would be willing to' b'go after that. i also would like to know how much these would cost me in the' b'states.please mail me back if you have any information.' b'' b'mike welker' b''
