b'' b'' b'' b'i would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is' b'output from a thermocouple, preferably by a factor of' b'100 or so that the resulting voltage can be fed' b'more easily into a personal-computer-based adc data' b'acquisition card.' b'' b'might anyone be able to point me to references to such' b'circuits? i have seen simple amplifier circuits before, but' b'i am not sure how well they work in practice.' b'' b"in this case, i'd like something which will amplify sufficiently" b'"nicely" to be used for thermocouples (say, a few degrees' b'accuracy or better).' b'' b'any pointers would be greatly appreciated!'
