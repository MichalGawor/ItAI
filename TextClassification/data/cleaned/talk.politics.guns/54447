b'' b' b' i have been at a shooting range where' b' gang members were "practicing" shooting.' b' b' how do "we" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops' b' or even law-abiding menacing minorities. btw why the sneer quotes?' b' b' "we" know because the area that the gun shop/shooting range is in is right on' b' the border of the west side of chicago. that is a gang infested area. there' b' are many, many bad things going on in that area. also, i have several' b'friends' b' that live very close to that area who have had problems with some of these' b' folks. by the way, where did i say that they were minorities?' b'' b'that was what i got from your phrasing, too. well, then, were they (the ones' b"you saw) black? you don't deny seem to deny it, either." b'' b' do you think' b' that only minorities have gangs? not so. as far as the quotes are concerned' b" it was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship. i" b" don't know about you but i have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship" b'by' b' taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.' b'' b'that is the recommended way to practice with a ccw, too. aim alone is no good' b"for defense, if you can't get the gun rapidly." b'' b' if' b" you would have been there andy it would've been obvious to you too." b'' b'what, outside of prejudice, would have made it obvious?' b'' b' of course' b' it might not have been. who knows. all i do know is that i was there, i' b'live' b' here and i know that they were gang bangers. when you live here long enough' b'it' b' becomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc.' b'' b"yes, prejudice is more subtle in the north, isn't it?" b'' b' one last' b' thing. my sister is a social worker. she makes it her point to find these' b' things out (gang signs, colors, etc) because it is in her best interest to do' b' so. she is nice enough to let me know these things so i can watch out for' b' myself as i live right on the border of the west side of the city. enough' b'said.' b'' b'' b'more than enough. i understand you completely.' b'' b' jason' b'' b'jim' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'"i\'m always rethinking that. there\'s never been a day when i haven\'t rethought' b'that. but i can\'t do that by myself." bill clinton april b'"if i were an american, as i am an englishman, while a foreign troop was landed' b'in my country, i never would lay down my arms,-never--never--never!"' b'william pitt, earl of chatham nov.
