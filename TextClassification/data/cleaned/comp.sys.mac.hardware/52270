b'' b'' b"a rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, so" b"they don't have any immediate financial interest), told me that" b'they have been having lots of problems with their centris b"he didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with the" b'floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files.' b'it sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems' b'and software compatibility problems with the machine.' b"he's not recommending the centris to anybody; he says to" b'consider a centris or a iivx. (why he would recommend a' b"iivx over an lciii i don't know, but that's what he said.)" b'so, what does the net think? did the dealer just get one flaky' b'machine, or did apple send the c610 out the door too early?' b'is your c610 working just great, or is it buggy too?' b'' b'my centris is working perfectly. there is one problem that i have' b'noticed. fastback ii backup utility does not work!!! the strange thing' b"is that it works with my friend's most of the time, however, it never" b'works with my machine. i assume it is some sort of software problem and' b'not hardware related.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'*************************************************************************' b'*************************************************************************'
