b'' b' i looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and' b' got the following information which i had claimed and you pooh-poohed.' b' the us has not sold iraq any arms.' b'' b'what about the land mines which have already been mentioned?' b'' b'i asked around in one of the areas you suggested yourself, and presented' b'the information i got. no mention of us landmines was given.' b'' b' other countries (like kuwait). information is hard to prove. you are' b' claiming that the us sold information? prove it. information' b' is hard to prove, almost certainly if the us did sell information, then that' b" fact is classified, and you can't prove it." b'' b'oh, very neat. dismiss everything i say unless i can prove beyond a shadow' b'of a doubt something which you yourself admit i can never prove to your' b"satisfaction. thanks, i'll stick to squaring circles." b'' b'mathew' b'' b'okay, so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable' b"evidence? i didn't realize you were a theist. i am doubting a claim" b'presented without any evidence to support it. if you are able to present' b'real evidence for it, then great. but unsupported claims, or even claims' b'by such and such news agency will not be accepted. if you want to' b'stick to the sheer impossible, instead of the merely difficult, then' b'fine.' b'' b'the statement that if such a fact is classified, then you' b"can't prove it, is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law. if you" b'have access to classified information that you know to be classified,' b'and you reveal it, there is a good chance that you or someone else' b'(the person who revealed it to you), is going to jail.' b'' b"i never said that you couldn't prove it to my satisfaction, i merely" b'said that it was difficult. (who said i try and make things easy' b'for people i am arguing with (unless of course, they need the' b'handicap).' b'' b'--' b'***************************************************************************' b"* m^2 time. it doesn't work. b'***************************************************************************'
