b'' b'i had said:' b'' b' merlyn, you missed the point too. christianity is a relationship. i have' b' a relationship with my god. i <<know him.' b'' b' consider your mother merlyn. you know your mother. what would you think' b' of me if i asserted that your mother is feet tall, murdered your father,' b' and sexually abused you when you were a kid? would you, who knows your' b' mother well, think was a blind arrogant idiot to proclaim such things?' b'' b'merlyn leroy says:' b'' b'this analogy is not good; for example, there are plenty of people who' b'"know" god as well as you do, but don\'t agree on things like:' b'' b'1) how many children he/she has' b'2) whether he/she approves of polygamy' b'3) whether mohammed was one of his/her prophets' b'' b'now, if you and all these other people who absolutely know what god is' b"like can't agree on basic attributes like these, at least one of you" b'who "knows" what this god-thing is like must be wrong; therefore,' b'subjective certainty is worthless regarding knowledge of this god.' b'' b"on the other hand, i don't know any large groups of people who claim" b'absolute knowledge of my mother and who disagree about her basic' b'attributes. this is the difference between real people and imaginary friends.' b'' b'meryln, therefore by your logic, since your people disagree about' b'the characteristics of your mother, you mother must be imaginary.'
