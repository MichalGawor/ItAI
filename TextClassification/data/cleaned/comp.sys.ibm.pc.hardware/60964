b'' b'i am thinking about buying a new motherboard and a cyrix 486dlc or mh' b'z. it will be an upgrade from a 386sx i was wondering if anybody has any' b'facts they can fill me in on. if anybody has one what do you think about it?' b'i will also get a cyrix math co with it. i have benchmarks for the two chips a' b'nd they look very good for the price. if anybody responds please send me email' b"because i usually don't check the mail very often but i check my reader daily." b'thanks for your info, and remember only respond if you have legitimate comp' b'laints or praise, not just to cyrix/amd bash. i know about what byte, computer' b'shopper, pc computing and etc... have said and that is why i am considering' b'the cyrix chip. thanks.........'
