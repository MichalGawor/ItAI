b'' b'| actually, the real reason that stern was getting a bigger rating share was that' b'| he was new in d.c., not because of the quality (if you can call it that) of' b'| his show. after the fine was issued he started to get better ratings because' b'| of the curious individuals who wanted to see how bad he actually was. since' b'| he came to d.c. he has had a greater turn over of listeners than the "grease"' b'| has. in other words, more people get sick of him sooner than they do of the' b'| "grease". after all, saying vagina or penis on the air is hilarious at first,' b'| the second time it is still a little funny, but when you do it all the time,' b'| and at the same time, think you are the greatest man on the planet (and tell' b'| everyone so) than you are going to get old really quick.' b'| give it up mark you are wrong.' b'|' b"excuse me, but if you really new what the show was about, you'd know that he" b"doesn't just say vagina and penis and that is how he get's his ratings. he" b"also addresss real issues as well as being outrageous. i don't hear any of these" b'other idiots doing a funny show and getting into some serious topics at the' b"same time, he get's people to think and entertains them at the same time," b'so try listening to his show a little closer before you tell them that they are' b'wrong, and by the way, if he is such a flash in the pan, why do his ratings sustain' b'so well? hmm?' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------' b'' b'j-e-t-s jets jets jets' b'-----------------------------------------------' b''
