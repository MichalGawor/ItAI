b'' b"okay, let's suppose that the nsa/nist/mykotronix registered" b"key system becomes standard and i'm able to buy such a system" b'from my local radio shack. every phone comes with a built in' b'chip and the government has the key to every phone call.' b'i go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key.' b'' b"what's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or" b'buying a used phone at a garage sale? whooa. the secret registered' b'keys just became unsynchronized. when the government comes' b'' b"it's very possible, even likely, that the serial number of the" b'invididual chip is broadcast either in a standard encrypted' b'format, so that all the big brother types need to do is listen to' b'the traffic, get a court order (generally just by saying that they' b'think you may be a crook) and go to it.' b'r' b'to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the' b"secret key registered under my name isn't the right one." b'' b'that leads me to conjecture that:' b'' b"1) the system isn't that secure. there are just two master keys" b'that work for all the phones in the country. the part about' b'registering your keys is just bogus.' b'' b'or' b'' b'2) the system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks' b'like this. criminals will quickly figure this out and go to' b'town.' b'' b'in either case, i think we need to look at this a bit deeper."\'jbl)mw:wxld2' b'' b''
