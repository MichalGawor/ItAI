b'' b'recently, i have been getting a cmos checksum error when i first turn on my' b"computer. it doesn't happen everytime i turn it on, nor can i predict when it" b'is going to happen. i have an ami bios and all of the setting are lost, for' b'example the drive types and the password options. however, the date and time' b'remain correct. if anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know.' b'' b'most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing this battery' b'maintains the contents of the cmos memory when ac power is turned off, and' b'if the battery is flakey then the contents of the cmos will be lost and' b'the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the cmos data). try' b'replacing the battery.' b'' b"if, however, your pc doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power" b'the cmos, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a' b"more normal lithium battery. if this isn't possible, make sure you leave" b'your pc on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor' b"charged. i'd opt for the battery change, though." b'' b"it's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is" b'corrupting the cmos. if your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and' b'check out your system.'
