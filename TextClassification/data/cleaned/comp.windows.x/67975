b'' b"| i have compiled xfig patchlevel with hp's x11r5 from hp-ux b'| augmented by the athena and mu libraries from an x11r5 distribution' b'| from iworks.ecn.uiowa.edu. it compiles nicely (although for one file' b'| the preprocessor macro definition table size needed to be increased).' b'| but when executed, nothing happens at all except for ever-growing' b'| memory requirements (eventually climaxing in a core dump). the binary' b'| of the identical program, compiled on with x11r4, has no' b'| problems. other programs like xtpanel compile, link, and run just' b'| fine with the same libraries.' b'|' b'| does this sound familiar, or am i going to have to figure this one out' b'| on my own...?' b'' b'please see the post i made yesterday (may which fixes the problem.' b'this was posted to comp.windows.x.apps.' b'' b'--' b'lawrence berkeley laboratory' b"i don't speak for lbl; they don't pay me enough for that."
