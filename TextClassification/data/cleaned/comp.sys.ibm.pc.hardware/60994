b'' b'a couple of months ago i tried out a hercules graphite card. a pretty nice' b'board. fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible even seemed to handle the' b'svga modes i have whined about here on occasion. at the time i was just' b'buying a vlb system, so after checking out the card i sent it back. i wanted' b'a vlb card, and purchased a fahrenheit vlb card. this card is fairly fast,' b'will do hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my cd-roms' b'(the svga thing i think; i have merely conjectured that is the cause of' b'an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those' b'programs than the modern boards i have tried. i have not gotten a straight' b'answer out of anybody...). the monitor i am using it with is a magnavox,' b'which also tops out at 1024x768x70 hz so its really a pretty good match.' b'' b'but...' b'' b'that is for my wife. i just purchased a viewsonic for myself, and am' b'looking for a graphics card to drive it. i want 70hz refresh,' b'and would really like it to handle my cd-roms. i tried the orchid p9000,' b'which did neither of those things (though robert at wietek did say that the' b'70hz was possible if i modifed the driver data base). so my thoughts go back' b'to hercules. they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the' b'graphite around the end of march. i have heard precisely zero about it since' b'then. does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities' b'(and price) it has?' b'' b'any info would be most appreciated.' b'' b'' b'geoff sherwood'
