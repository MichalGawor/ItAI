b'' b'' b'' b' i just bought a little gizmo that is supposed to be installed "in' b' series with the tip or ring lines" of the phone wire. which ones are' b' those? suppose i am holding a regular phone wire, such that the little' b' plastic tooth (on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead' b' ends that you plug into the phone) is facing down, and away from me.' b' which of the wires that i see is the "tip" and which is the "ring"?' b'' b' mike levin' b'' b'assuming you are refering to standard pots or ground start lines:' b'' b'if you are looking at loop start lines under idle conditions, the ring' b'conductor is the one with approximately to vdc with respect to' b'ground while the tip conductor is at or very near ground potential (be sure' b'to reference the telco ground when taking your measurements).' b'' b'if you are dealing with ground start lines under idle conditions, the ring' b'conductor will be the one with approximately to vdc while the tip' b"conductor would look like it's floating (you may see some potential from" b'line capacitance it will bleed off over time). remember to use the telco' b'ground as your reference when making measurements.' b'' b'' b'' b'_________' b'______/ b"/ caprice b'/_____ sport coupe_____/' b'/_________/' b'' b'' b'' b''
