b'' b'washington (upi) secretary of state warren christopher said tuesday' b'there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the balkans than' b'ordering american fighters to bomb the serbs, but a frustrated senator' b'told him to do just that.' b"``we've not done a damn thing,'' sen. joseph biden, d-del., told" b'christopher at a hearing of the senate foreign relations committee.' b'``preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in bosnia-' b'herzegovina.' b'biden chastised the administration and its republican predecessor for' b'what he characterized as a limp response to the serbian policy of' b"``ethnic cleansing'' of muslims, including rape and shelling of" b'civilians.' b'``the time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact' b"that all the options are bad ones,'' biden said. ``they are all bad ones" b"and we ought to pick a couple.''" b'biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the' b'former yugoslavia so the muslim-dominated bosnian government might have' b'a chance to at least defend itself against the serbs.' b'christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to' b'****************************************************' b'the radical islamic government of iran.' b'***************************************' b'o, i c!' b'biden endorsed bombing serbian heavy weapons around the besieged' b'eastern town of srebrenica.' b"``there's not a military person...who will not tell you that they" b'could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry' b"around srebrenica,'' biden said." b'``if you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have' b'saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred' b"right now.''" b"military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the" b"equation,'' biden said." b'....................................' b'despite the frustrations and pressure, christopher had no enthusiasm' b'for american combat aircraft to strike serb positions in bosnia-' b'herzegovina.' b'....................' b"\t``clearly we are at a turning point in the bosnia situation,''" b'christopher said. ``air strikes are among those steps that are so' b'complex because they tend to interfere with the humanitarian endeavours.' b"i think there may be better options.''" b'' b'humanitarian as in feeding them and let them get raped and killed.' b'' b'political conflict. clinton vowed during the presidential campaign to' b'*******(then)' b'lift the arms embargo and to strike at serbian heavy weapons with u.s.' b'combat aircraft.' b'\tchristopher said airstrikes would likely ``increase the level of' b'*******************(now)' b"fighting and cause our allies to draw back'' or even ``pull out the" b"humanitarian effort.''" b'\tgreat britain and france have balked at foreign military intervention' b'in bosnia-herzegovina for fear that their peacekeeping troops on the' b'ground may suffer serbian retribution.' b'' b"why don't they get the hell out of there, they ared doing nothing to" b'protect the victims anyway.. maybe becasue they have a different agenda.' b'' b"\tsen. nancy kassebaum, r-kan., seemed to agree with christopher's" b'*************************' b'assessment and stressed the need not to build up bosnian expectations' b'for heavy u.s. military intervention.' b"\t``it's very important that expectations aren't raised high on the" b"part of the beleagured bosnians,'' she said." b'\tair strikes might have made a difference eight months ago, she said,' b'but the strategic significance of that step now is questionable. like' b'christopher, kassebaum said it might jeopardize the humanitarian relief' b'effort.' b'' b'now that they made sure the bosnian (who were the only real subject of the' b'embargo last year, as everybody knows that the serbs had an unlimited supply' b'of arms) wre massacred without having a chance to defend themselves, now this' b'evil coldhearted snake is saying "it is too late to save them, so let them die.' b''
