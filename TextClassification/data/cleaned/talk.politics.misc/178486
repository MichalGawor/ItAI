b'' b' \ta few weeks ago i found out about some of the politics that' b' is going on with the texas bullet train, and was appalled at some' b' of the apparent underhanded tactics to push this thing through' b' without any public say whatsoever. so, i wrote up a short' b' editorial thing and posted it, hoping to get some discussion.' b'' b" i suppose editorials don't do it here. so now i am asking for" b' the general opinion of the net about the proposed high speed' b' train.' b'' b' what do you think? i personally think it is a stupid idea, and' b' that there are a few people somewhere who are going to get very' b' rich from this deal.' b'' b'' b'my opinion is this: in a society whose economy is primarily based on' b'capitalism, the role of government should be to provide those goods and' b"services that need providing for the general public's good. but government" b'should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible' b'for a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them.' b'i agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make' b'money and will rely heavily on state tax dollars.' b'' b'the question, i think, then becomes: do we, the general public, need the train?' b'' b'i certainly do not, nor will i ever, need this train in lubbock, texas. with' b"the inexpensive air travel provided between dallas and houston, i don't think" b'people in dallas or houston need it either.' b'' b'david mcgaughey' b'texas tech university'
