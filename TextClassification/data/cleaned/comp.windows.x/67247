b'' b'i am working on an x-window based application that needs to' b'override some of the window manager focus processing. i am' b'using x11r4 and motif currently, although i will also be' b'working with open look in the future.' b'' b'what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the' b'user from switching from one window of the application to' b"another window. let's say, for example, that window a is on top" b'of window b in the window hierarchy. normally, if the user clicks' b'the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the' b'window hierarchy and placed on top of window a. under certain' b'circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in window b i need to' b'beep and prevent window b from being raised on top of window' b'a.' b'' b"from the research and testing i've done so far, it appears that" b'this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this' b"case motif. i haven't found any way to override this default" b'processing through standard x window functions. i can tell' b'when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping' b"notify events, but i can't find any way to tell motif not to make the" b'switch.' b'' b"the temporary solution i've currently come up with is very" b'kludgy but it partially works. when i detect such a window switch' b'in those cases when the switch is not allowed, i manually force' b'the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call' b'and beep with the xbell function. this provides the necessary' b'functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places' b'twice.' b'' b'does anyone know how i can tell motif (or preferably *any*' b"window manager) when i don't want the window order switch to" b'actually take place? respond either by e-mail or posting to this' b'newsgroup.' b'' b'cheers.... randall' b'' b'***************************************************************************' b'* randall severy uunet: uunet!ge!severy b'* n. washington st. mc05a genie: rsevery b'* rockville, md usa phone: b'***************************************************************************'
