b'' b' i have an algorithm similar to bresenhams line drawing algorithm, that' b' draws a line by stepping along the minor axis and drawing slices like' b' aaaa, bbbb, cccc in the following diagram.' b'' b' aaaa' b' bbbb' b' cccc' b'' b'' b'yes, that\'s known as "bresenhams run length slice algorithm for' b'incremental lines". see fundamental algorithms for computer graphics,' b'springer-verlag, berlin heidelberg b'' b" i have tried to extrapolate this to circles but i can't figure out" b' how to determine the length of the slices. any ideas?' b'' b"hmm. i don't think i can help you with this, but you might" b'take a look at the following:' b'' b'"double-step incremental generation of lines and circles",' b'x. wu and j. g. rokne, computer graphics and image processing,' b'vol no. mar. pp. b'' b'"double-step generation of ellipses", x. wu and j. g. rokne,' b'ieee computer graphics applications, may pp. b'' b'graeme gill.'
