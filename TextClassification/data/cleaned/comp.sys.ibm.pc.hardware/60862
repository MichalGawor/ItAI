b'' b"this may be a dumb question, but i need to put a hard drive on my father's" b'pc/xt, either mfm, rll, or ide. i know how to hook it up, but how do i tell' b'the computer the geometry of the drive. on my you set it in the bios, but' b"i doubt that's how it's done on an xt. i thought it might be software with" b"the controller card, but the ide card for xt's that i saw didn't come with" b"any. also, how do i low level format it once it's on the computer? (assuming" b'a drive which needs formatting)' b'' b'since there is no bios support for st-506 interface hard disks in an xt,' b'that support must come from a bios extension rom on the (mfm/rll) hard disk' b'controller. usually the controller has a rom-based low level format' b'program (a common jump address is c800:0005 you can type g=c800:5 from' b'debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it "knows" about.' b'sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you' b'can enter them manually in the llf menu. failing that, you must use a' b'third-party hd prep program like speedstor, disk manager, or the like.' b'' b'ide drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the' b'drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. plug' b'it in and go to fdisk.' b'' b'--'
