b'' b'it was great to hear that umass is bringing back hockey! it reminded me that a' b'couple of years ago there was talk that both bimidgi (sp?) and mankato state' b'trying to upgrade their programs to div. status. i also seem to remember' b'that they had some trouble with new ncaa rule about just who was allowed to' b'compete at the div. level. was that ever resolved? also, i was just' b'wondering if there is any college hockey east of colorado (alaska excepted).' b'with the new popularity of hockey on the west coast, i would expect there to' b'be some interest building at the collegiate levels too. anyone heard anything?'
