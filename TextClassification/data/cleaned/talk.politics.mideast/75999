b'' b'' b'the readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents' b'of those files.' b'so it will be nice if yigal will tell us:' b'1. why do american authorities consider yigal arens to be dangerous?' b'' b'adl authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous, including' b'the millions of americans of arab ancestry. perhaps you can answer' b'the question as to why the adl maintained files and spied on adc members' b'in california (and elsewhere??)? friendly rivalry perhaps?' b'' b'come on! most if not all arabs are sympathetic to the palestinian war' b'against israel. that is why the adl monitors arab organizations. that is' b'the same reason the us monitored communist organizations and soviet nationals' b'only a few years ago.' b'' b'perhaps yigal is a greenpeace member? or the naacp? or a reporter?' b'or a member of any of the dozens of other political organizations/ethnic' b'minorities/occupations that the adl spied on.' b'' b'all of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-' b'israel activity or propoganda. the adl is simply monitoring them so that if' b"anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise." b'' b'2. why does the adl have an interest in that person b'' b'paranoia?' b'' b"no, that is why world trade center bombings don't happen in israel (aside from" b'the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like zein isa b'palestinian whose american group planned to bow up the israeli embassy and' b'"kill many jews.") are caught. as mordechai levy of the jdl said, paranoid' b'jews live longer.' b'' b'3. if one does trust either the us government or the adl what an' b' additional information should he send them b'' b'the names of half the posters on this forum, unless they already' b'have them.' b'' b'they probably do.' b'' b'gideon ehrlich' b'-anwar' b'ed.' b''
