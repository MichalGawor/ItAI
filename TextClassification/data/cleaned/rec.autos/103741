b'' b'' b' hello auto enthusiasts!' b'' b'' b'{stuff deleted}' b'' b' viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that' b' supposedly detects people approcahing the car....' b'' b'' b'this is primarily for convertibles. i have a convertible and have looked at' b'this feature in detail. alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want' b'to get one of these. it has zones in it that can be shut down independently so' b'that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that' b'would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.' b"i don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you" b'leave the top down on.' b'' b'avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package. it talks to' b'people as they walk by. i saw one installed on a lotus esprit. the kids would' b"taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back." b'the owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.' b'' b'{stuff deleted}' b'' b' ron garnett' b'' b'' b'{more stuff deleted}' b'' b'merrill' b'' b'my neighbor runs a viper(r) distributorship and installs them on all' b'saturns sold in my area (anne arundel county, md). he has an sc with the' b'viper voice alarm installed. the alarm does everything, turn on the car,' b'the radio, the heater, roll down windows, unlock the doors... the alarm goes' b'off more frequently on hot days when a person walks by. it gets sensitive up' b"to about feet in 85degree heat. it isn't as bad as convetional siren alarms," b'because it doesn\'t continue to wail, it just says "protected by viper, please' b'stand back!" and shuts up...
