b'' b'' b'' b' while taking an extended easter vacation, i was going north on i-45' b' somewhere between centerville, tx and dallas, tx and i came upon a' b' train parked on a trestle with its locomotive sitting directly over' b' the northbound lanes. there appeared to be movement within the cab' b' and out of curiosity i slowed to to get a better look. just as i' b' passed from underneath the trestle, my radar detector went into full' b' alert all lights lit and all chirps, beeps, and buzzes going strong.' b' i thought i had been nailed good but no police materialized.' b'' b" could this have been caused by the train's radio or what?" b'' b'' b'' b"i don't know about trains, but i've saw a sign on the back of a" b'greyhound bus that warns you that your radar detector may be set off.' b"it doesn't explain why, but it does set off my radar detector." b'' b'___________________________________________________________________________' b'***** from the e-net desk of: rick colombo cd/dcd/dsg b"* fermi nat'l acc'l lab fermilab b'*** p.o. box ms feynman computer center b'* of course i speak for: fermilab, congress and the president... not!!!'
