b'' b'' b'' b'work, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors' b'with the power switch on front. b'' b' this is a pet peeve of mine. i wish companies would put power switches on the' b' front of the equipment! if my apple monitor had the switch on the front, i' b' would happily power it off at night. almost every piece of computer equipment' b' i own/use has the switch on the back (including external hard drives and' b' modems--why?). i hope front-mounted switches become the norm, and soon.' b'' b'it is just extra wire and work to put the switch in front. usually the easiest' b'place to put the switch is wherever the power cord enters the machine, and' b'people hate power cords on the front!! i prefer a power strip.' b'' b''
