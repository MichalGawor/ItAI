b'' b'' b'' b'i am working on a project where we are going to be including' b'both still and moving grapics within a database. of course' b'jpeg and mpeg come to mind as the formats of choice for the' b'various files. however, from what i read on the net, it seems' b'as if there are several different forms of each of these.' b'' b'what i want to do, is settle on a file format which i can count' b'on as being a standard format years from now. i know apple is going' b"to support quicktime on the new power pc's and, so this" b'may be the format of choice.' b'' b"what format does apple's quicktime use for their products? i guess" b'it is some kind of mpeg for their motion picture. is it any different' b'than standard mpeg files?' b'' b'thanx for any info!' b'' b'art.' b'' b'' b''
