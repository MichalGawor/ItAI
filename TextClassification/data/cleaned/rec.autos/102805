b'' b'' b"i'm plannig to trade my sentra se-r in with a nx2000. my car has b"miles on it and is a model. the nx2000 the dealer is selling is a b'model with 23,000miles on it. it has a t-bar roof, a/c, and an airbag,' b'which my sentra does not have. they are asking for is that a fair' b'deal? the only thing i noticed about the nx2000 is that the engine did not' b'seem to have as much torque as my sentra which has the same identical' b'engine. i presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine' b"to it's limits occassionaly while i did that on mine, thuis the nx2000's" b'engine is a little "tight." so, if i buy the nx2000 and "excercise" it' b'well, should that slight power problem go away? any advice on this will be' b'much appreciated. thanks. please reply via e-mail if possible.' b'--' b'a motion picture major at the brooks institute of photography, ca' b'santa barbara and a foreign student from kuala lumpur, malaysia.' b'' b'"the mind is the forerunner of all states."'
