b'' b'' b'i am looking for a means to add fli and flc animation creation' b'to a windows application. i was hoping for something along the lines' b'of aawin or aaplay by autodesk but for the creation of these delta' b'compressed animations. i have flilib but this seems to be coded for' b'the large memory model of dos with turbo c. ideally i would' b'like a dll or medium model object library, but would settle' b"for anything, really. i've seen other windows apps with" b'fli/flc creation, did they hack the flilib code into submission?' b'' b'any pointers would be appreciated, please send mail directly' b'to me and i will summarize the results if there is interest.' b'' b'- andrew hudson'
