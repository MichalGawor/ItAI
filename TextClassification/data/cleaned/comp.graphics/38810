b'' b'i have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.' b'' b'when an incident ray (i) strikes an object at point p, first' b'the normal (n) is calculated. light rays are calculated (l1 to ln' b'where n is the number of light sources) these being the light' b'rays that do not intersect with anything. the reflected ray (r) and' b'the transmitted ray (t) is calculated from the formulae.' b'' b'calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours' b'along the rays (r and t) as rcol and tcol. each object has its own' b'colour ocol and each light source has licol i n).' b'' b'the question is:' b"how do you combine rcol, tcol, ocol and all the licol's to get" b'the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray?' b'' b'all colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components' b'between and b'' b'if anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?' b'' b'--' b'adrian secchia' b''
