b'' b'' b' here is the story:' b' i have a network with macs on localtalk. one of them has an' b" ethernet card, and is currently connected to a next (don't laugh" b' i got it for the price of a mac iisi). the next is connected' b' to the internet over slip running on a baud modem.' b'' b' currently, we can telnet from the mac w/ ethernet to the next,' b' and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.' b'' b' what we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that' b' will route telnet sessions from the localtalk macs to the next' b" via the ethernet mac. from what we have heard, air doesn't do" b' the trick.' b'' b' software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that' b" there aren't going to be any." b'' b' our immediate interest is to be able to get to the next and telnet' b" out again. the slip connection doesn't allow us to assign ip numbers" b' to machines, so everyone shares that number...oh well...' b'' b'' b'what you need is a hardware router such as etherroute/tcp made by' b'compatable systems this will allow you to connect your localtalk' b'network macs) to your ethernet network (next and ethernet mac). it will' b'route tcp/ip protocol between the two networks. software routers are also' b"available for less money, but i'm not sure if they work with tcp/ip." b'' b'paul'
