b'' b'' b'| the authorities i am referring to is the authority of the world' b'| islamic community over itself. my point was simply that islamic' b'| law does apply to muslims wherever they are despite the fact that' b'| islamic law may not be enforcable in non-islamic countries.' b'' b"muslims residing in the uk may decide to be 'tried' (or whatever) by the" b'islamic community, but their rulings have no legal consequences in these' b'isles.' b'' b"it's not really their _decision_ to be tried. the rulings _do_ have" b'legal consequences, but only in islamic law and not in uk law (this' b'should be obvious). enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making' b'of a judgment. take for example the judgments of the world court. this' b'is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no' b'physical or economic effect but which _are_ important despite the fact' b'that their judgments cannot be enforced' b'' b'the person may be excommunicated (or similar) but if it decided to' b'mete out violent laws such as the fatwa then it would be breaking uk laws' b'itself, and the persons doing such would be liable to prosecution.' b'' b'' b'of course, have you read any of this thread before this post?' b'' b'' b' to ignore' b"the country's laws in preference to religious laws which are not indigenous" b'to the country in question is an absurd and arrogant notion.' b'' b'of course, it is a sort of anarchism. anarchism is explicitly against' b'islam. thank you for your well reasoned response, but it is beside the' b"points i've been making in this thread." b'' b'' b'gregg' b'' b''
