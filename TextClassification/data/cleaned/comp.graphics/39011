b'' b'' b'| i\'m using "rayshade" on the u.w. computers here, and i\'d like input' b'| from other users, and perhaps swap some ideas. i could post' b"| uuencoded .gifs here, or .ray code, if anyone's interested. i'm having" b'| trouble coming up with colors that are metallic (i.e. brass, steel)' b'| from the rgb values.' b'' b"sorry, i'm not a rayshade user but hey, it looks like this group could" b'use some traffic. my guess is that "metallic" isn\'t a color, in the rgb' b"sense. rather, it's a matter of how the surface reflects light. i'm not" b'sure what property metallic materials have, that makes them recognizable' b"as such, but i'm pretty sure any color material can look metallic."
