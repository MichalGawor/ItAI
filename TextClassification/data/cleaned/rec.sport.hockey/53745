b'' b'' b'' b' podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to' b' play in cape breton in the ahl playoffs like kovalev, zubov,' b' and andersson...obviously sather and pocklington are not' b' the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly' b" in this case they've massively outclassed paramount and the" b' new york rangers.' b'' b'what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc?' b'i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev, zubov, and andersson for' b'binghamton, but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play' b'for springfield, while nylander wanted to play for sweden. the whalers allowed' b'the nhl to decide, and the nhl chose the wcs. how does this differ from the' b'rangers and oilers? did the whalers have to go through the league, or could' b'they have forced nylander to play in springfield?' b'' b'-sg'
