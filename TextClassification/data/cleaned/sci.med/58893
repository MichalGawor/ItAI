b'' b'i remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity' b'which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring' b'from the diet. the theory which was backed up by interesting anecdotal' b'results is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these' b"chemicals than other people. i don't remember any connection being made" b"with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet."
