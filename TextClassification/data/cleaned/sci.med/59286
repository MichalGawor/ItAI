"an agreement like this will greatly facilitate' b'' b'hicnet medical newsletter page b'volume number april b'' b"companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a" b'much more efficient way," said scolnick. he also said that the' b'collaboration would not violate antitrust laws. in creating the agreement,' b'merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups, including act-up.' b'dr. daniel hoth, director of the division on aids at the national institute' b'of allergy and infectious disease said, "we\'re delighted to see the' b'pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the' b'information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for' b'aids." related stories: wall street journal p. b1; philadelphia' b'inquirer p. a3; usa today p. 1b' b'==================================================================' b'"the next step in aids treatment" nature vol. no. p. b'(maddox, john)' b'' b'although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of' b'people infected with hiv, the findings do not indicate that azt should not be' b'administered in people with full-blown aids, writes columnist john maddox.' b'azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv-positive people on' b'the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of' b't-cell counts. however, a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should' b'not be used early in the course of disease. while the cd4 counts of the b'people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving' b'only placebo, the first three years of follow-up have shown that the' b'proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to' b'death were not significantly different at roughly percent. the' b'conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv-infected' b'individuals, and that cd4 cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the' b'progression to aids in infected people. but nothing is implied by the study' b'of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already' b'appeared--there is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the' b'evidence now available. it is much more alarming that the cd4 count has' b'proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv' b'infection. aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the' b'beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of' b'disease. the general application of such an assay will probably in itself' b'provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids, concludes' b'maddox.' b'==================================================================' b'"infective and anti-infective properties of breastmilk from hiv-1-infected' b'women" lancet vol. no. p.
