b'' b'can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem i am having?' b'i have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode dtmf tones and send' b'the resultant in ascii to a pc. these boards run on the serial interface.' b'i need to run of the boards somwehat simultaneously. i need to be able to ho' b'ok them up to a pc the problem is, how do i hook up serial devices to one' b'pc inexpensivley, so that all can send data simulataneously (or close to it)?' b'any help would be greatly appreciated!' b'abhin singla' b'if you can modify the design of the dtmf decoder, the ideal comunications' b'would be over a multi-drop system, like rs-485. rs-485 boards are available' b"for pc's, probably cheaper than a bunch of rs-232 channels, and rs-485 is" b'cheaper to build onto your satellite modules, using only a single supply' b'8-pin dip driver chip. software at the pc end would be similarly complex' b'for either rs-232 or rs-485, in my opinion. the higher data rates possible' b'with rs-485 would permit quasi-simultaneous data transmission.' b'hope this helps.' b'' b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' b'vancouver, bc, canada. phone: ext b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' b''
