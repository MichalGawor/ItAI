b'' b'with a little luck, i could own a c650 sometime in the near future, and' b'so i was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:' b'' b'1. what speed simms does the c650 need/want? (i know that it needs 80ns' b'vram...not sure for the main ram.)' b'' b"2. i've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the" b"c650's ram...132 and megs. which is true? (perhaps another phrasing" b'would be better: does the meg version come with all megs on the logic' b'board, or megs a meg simm?)' b'' b'just wondering....' b'' b'--' b'* "it\'s astounding; time is fleeting; madness takes play b'* its toll." riff raff, rocky horror picture show pinball! b"*** disclaimer: they're my opinions. are they yours?
