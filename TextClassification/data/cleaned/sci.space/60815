b'' b"let's see. these aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. that term" b'denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. the' b'rockets you describe are called hpr, or high power rockets, to' b'distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. they use factory-made' b'ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines' b'with graphite nozzles. the engines are classified by impulse. a "d"' b'engine, for example, can have no more than newton-seconds of impulse.' b'an "f" engine can have no more than ns. each letter corresponds to a' b'doubling of the maximum impulse. so far, engines up to size "o" are' b'available pretty much off the shelf. engines of size h and above are' b'shipped as class b explosives, and as such are controlled. engines of' b'size f and below are shipped as class c explosives, and are not as' b'controlled. class f engines, btw, are not hpr engines, but model rocket' b'engines. (class g engines go in and out of legal limbo.)' b'' b'there is an hpr society, the tripoli rocket society, i believe, which' b'holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities' b'(faa waiver included) taken care of. the national association of' b'rocketry is more concerned with engines below h, though it is involved' b'in hpr as well. these societies certify users of hpr rockets, and' b'companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.' b'' b"bottom line: it's legit. i suggest you send for a catalog but forget" b'the dynamite, will ya?' b'' b'-larry c.'
