b'' b'' b' getting at here. this puppy is far enough away, that if a bright' b' burst happens nearby, the huge annulus created by it will hopefully' b' intersect the line or general circle given by batse, and we can get a' b' moderately accurate position. say oh, or degrees. that is the' b' closest anyone has ever gotten with it.' b'' b'' b'you can do a whole hell of a lot better than or degrees with' b'the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network.' b'ignore the directional information from batse; just look at the time' b'of arrival. with three detectors properly arranged, one can often' b'get positions down to ~arc minutes.' b'' b"btw, about oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the" b'fairly near future? some of the grbs have very short rise times b'ms). we could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a' b'distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing' b'and t the time resolution. for t ms and b au, this is on the' b'order of light years. i understand statistics will reduce this' b'number considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the' b'wrong direction.' b'' b'paul'
