b'' b'fyi...i just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to' b'what the group is for......' b'' b'' b'a note to the users of alt.psychoactives....' b'' b'this group was originally a takeoff from sci.med. the reason for' b'the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive' b'drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, prozac, lithium,etc),' b'antipsychotics(melleral(sp?), etc), ocd drugs(anafranil, etc), and' b"so on and so forth. it didn't take long for this group to degenerate" b"into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere. that's to bad, for most of the" b'serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have' b'left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through' b'hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.' b'' b'it was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of' b'the above mentioned.' b'' b'oh well, i had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and i decided' b'to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old' b'nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.' b'' b'i think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it' b'being moderated...too bad.' b'' b'oh well, obviously, no one really cares.' b'' b'bill claussen' b'' b'' b'would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group?' b'' b'bill claussen' b''
