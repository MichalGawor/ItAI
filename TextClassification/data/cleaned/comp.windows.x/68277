b'' b'i have an application that wants to walk the server window hierarchy,' b'looking for a window with a specific property.' b'' b'i think what happens is that xquerytree gives me an array of n' b'children, but by the time i get to the nth child window, it has been' b'destroyed. then i get a badwindow error, and my application exits.' b'' b"how can i make this robust? i've thought of the following:" b'...' b'2. set up an x error handler that longjmps back to where i' b' made the offending call. is this safe? do i have to' b' longjmp, or can i just return?' b'' b'badwindow is an x protocol error. if you write a custom error handler' b'which does not do "exit(1);" the error handler will return and let' b'your program carry on. so, using a xseterrorhandler is the way to' b'go, but never mind the longjmp.' b'' b'' b'3. register for destroynotify on all the windows returned from' b' xquerytree. b'' b'too hard....'
