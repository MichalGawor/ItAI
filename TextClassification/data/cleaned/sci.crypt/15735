b'' b'since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the executive' b'branch and approved by the judicial branch, it seems clear that one' b'of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the' b'judicial branch. i suggest the supreme court, or, regionally, the' b'courts of appeal. more specifically, the offices of their clerks.' b'' b'courts already operate substantial record-keeping operations. some' b'of these records are confidential. so the concept of a court holding' b'information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal' b'precedents. the judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive' b'branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be. so judicial' b'control of keys is appropriate.' b'' b'for the other half of the key, i suggest a unit of congress, the' b"general accounting office. the gao is congress's staff unit for keeping" b"tabs on the executive branch, and has an excellent reputation. it's" b'controlled strictly by congress; the executive branch has no authority' b'over it.' b'' b'with keys split between the legislative and judicial branches,' b'we might have a chance of this system working honestly. if, of course,' b'a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before' b'they reach the repositories.' b'' b'this should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the' b'whole clipper concept. but if we have to have it, splitting control' b'across all three branches of government might make it work.' b'' b'john nagle'
