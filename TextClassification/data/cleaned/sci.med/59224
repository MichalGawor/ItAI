b'' b'' b'i hope gordon banks did not mean to imply that notions such as' b'hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not' b'be investigated. many researchers have made breakthroughs by' b'figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought' b'"virtually impossible to test for."' b'' b'indeed, i would be surprised if "candida overbloom" were such a' b'phenomena. i would think that candida would produce signature' b'byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the' b'extent of recent infection. i realize this might get quite' b'tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient' b'or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as' b'"virtually impossible."' b'' b'i recall reading in the recently revised edition of the "yeast connection"' b'that there is indeed work by researchers to do this. of course, they are' b'working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus' b'membrane tissue with associated "mild" inflammatory response can and does' b'occur in a large number of people. if you reject this "yeast hypothesis",' b"then i'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic" b'endeavor. stay tuned.' b'' b'jon noring' b'' b'--' b'' b'charter member infj club.' b'' b"if you're dying to know what infj means, be brave, e-mail me, i'll send info." b'=============================================================================' b"| jkn international ip fred's gourmet chocolate b"| carlton place phone chips world's best! b'| livermore, ca v-mail: b'=============================================================================' b"who are you? read alt.psychology.personality! that's where the action is."
