b'' b'' b' well, germany was hardly the only country to discriminate against the' b' jews, although it has the worst reputation because it did the best job' b' of expressing a general european dislike of them. this should not turn' b" into a debate on antisemitism, but you should also point out that luther's" b" antisemitism was based on religious grounds, while hitler's was on racial" b" grounds, and wagnmer's on aesthetic grounds. just blanketing the whole" b' group is poor analysis, even if they all are bigots.' b'' b'i find these to be intriguing remarks. could you give us a bit' b'more explanation here? for example, which religion is anti-semitic,' b'and which aesthetic?' b'' b'jon.'
