b'' b'summary: location of cap lock and ctrl keys on pc keyboard' b'keywords: cap lock and ctrl key' b'date: mon, apr gmt' b'does anyone know of a software that can exchange caps lock and ctrl' b"keys on the at-style keyboard? i'm looking for a memory resident" b'program that can work with other programs, rather than a feature in a' b'specific program (i am aware of a shareware program "back and forth"' b'that provides this feature within that program). thanks.' b'' b'a program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the' b'msdos/keyboard directory will do this. it is written in assembler and it' b'best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map. it is possible,' b'however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard' b'driver if you do not have a compiler. i used hexed100.zip, also available' b'on simtel. simply serach for the codes to locate the biginning' b'of the "normal" keyboard map. then swap the codes for the keys that you' b'wish to swap. see the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report' b'the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).' b'good luck,' b'' b'- pete' b'____________________________________________________________________________' b'| electrohydrodynamic laboratory b'| fluid mechanics and wind engineering program b'| civil engineering department b'| colorado state university b'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
