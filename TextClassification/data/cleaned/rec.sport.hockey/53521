b'' b'after watching the pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as' b"possible), i've really noticed an increase in tom barasso's cheap shots" b'this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other' b"goaltenders). i've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. just" b'as examples last night, i noticed him elbowing scott stevens in the' b'head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got stevens' b'(scott) and tocchet minute minors. he also kicked john mclean. of' b"course he wasn't called for that. isn't kicking an automatic match" b'penalty and game suspension? i think glenn anderson got one a few' b"years ago for kicking gaetan duchesne in the chest. there's no doubt in" b"my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall. he's also" b'very good.' b'' b'how about that tocchet head-butt? is there an automatic susppension that' b"goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? i can't remember anymore." b'' b'oh, the playoffs should be fun,' b'ralph' b''
