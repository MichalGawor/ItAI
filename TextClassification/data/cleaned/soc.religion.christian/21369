b'' b'' b' ...there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of' b' repeated lives on earth.' b'' b'there is a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion, clearly makes' b"a positive inference to reincarnation. i don't remember which one it is off of" b'the top of my head, but it basically goes like this: jesus is talking with the' b'apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come,' b'elijah must first come. jesus replies that elijah has come, but they did not' b'recognize him. it then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to' b'john the baptist. this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation. can anyone' b'offer a reasonable alternative interpretation? i would be very interested to' b'hear it.'
