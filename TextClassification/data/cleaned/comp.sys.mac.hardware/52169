b'' b'' b'i have a se/30 and a generation systems 8bit pds card for a b'screen.' b'it worked great until i upgraded from to mb ram.' b'now with sys7.1 and mode32 or 32enabler it does not boot..' b'' b'a tech support person said the card does not support these 32bit' b'fixes.' b'' b'i guess he is right. early versions of the rasterops cards did not either,' b'but they fixed it, and people with problems can get a free rom upgrade' b'from rasterops.' b'' b'but: when pressing the shift key while booting (when the ext. monitor' b'goes black after having been grey) the system sometimes boots properly!!' b'and then works ok with the 20mb and full graphics.' b'' b"what's happening???" b'' b'very easy. if you boot without the mode32 control panel, then it will' b'disable (or rather not reinstall) the 32-bit clean patches. so when' b'you run ok you must be in 24-bit adressing mode. check about this macintosh' b'and see if you havce a 12+mb system.' b'' b'thanks a lot for any advice!!!' b'please answer by mail.' b'' b'sent seperately.' b'ossip kaehr' b'voice: b'--' b' b'/_/\\ ossip kaehr\thermannstrasse d-1000 berlin germany b' b'--' b'povl h. pedersen macintosh specialist. knows some dos and unix too.'
