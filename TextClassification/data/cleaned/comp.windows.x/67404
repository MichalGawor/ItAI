b'' b'i have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes' b'and collects data from that nodes periodically. i need to display this data on' b'my x application. i tried' b'to invoke this server using xtaddapptimeout which works ok. but the' b"problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. so i doesn't" b'returns to eventloop during that time and my application remains busy and' b"it doesn't respond to users input. i button press events are queued and" b'exected after server finished its task. now i am going to try appaddinput' b'call. so that it reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.' b'' b'i am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client' b'which is my x application will read. now i have some doubts which you may' b'be able to clarify.' b'' b'1) when i fork a process. it will create to copy of my process. right b'now what does this two copies mean? two shells. where should i fork' b'my application. what are the responsibilities of this processes. how' b'should i call this processes.?' b'' b'2) can i fork more than one processes. so that i can read from more' b'than one servers input.' b'' b'thanks' b'' b'samir patel' b'' b'/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////' b'' b'' b'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'
