b'' b'i have a set of four 235-60-r14 big o tires that i had on my thunder' b'bird. we bought them and then traided the car in. they would not give me' b'anything for them so i had them taken off. we drove about miles on' b'them. they are mile tires. they are sporty looking low-profile, and' b'take corners realy well. if you are interested please contact me at
