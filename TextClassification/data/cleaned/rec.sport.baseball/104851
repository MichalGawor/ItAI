b'' b'' b'as the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not' b'batting 4th for the giants behind will clark. barry is such an awesome and' b'consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league. imho, to' b'have williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting' b'4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the' b'giants.' b'' b'2 simple reasons:' b'' b'(1) batting williams ahead of bonds will create a left(clark),' b'right(williams), left(bonds) situation in the middle of the' b'batting order. this makes it tougher for opposing manager' b'to change pitchers.' b'' b'(2) having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get' b'more good pitches to hit. this is important since he struggles' b"so much with breaking balls. opposing pitchers don't want to" b'walk williams to get to bonds.' b'' b'' b'edward hui' b'' b'' b''
