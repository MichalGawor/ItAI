b'' b'' b'' b'' b'avoda ivrit hebrew labor' b'---------------------------------' b'' b'"hebrew labor" is a concept which has served the zionist movement' b'for a long time. it has a double-barreled message: the new jew' b'must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; the' b'land in this country must pass into jewish hands, i.e. to the same' b'new jew who has "learned" to work it. both aspects of the' b'two-pronged concept of "hebrew labor" have racist connotations. on' b"the one hand, the diaspora jew's lack of training in physical" b'labor is a myth shared by zionists and antisemites. on the other' b'hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the' b'arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.' b'' b'the occupation and the cheap palestinian labor which streamed from' b'the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and' b'hot-houses of israel relegated the myth of "hebrew labor" to the' b'history books and nostalgic memories of the zionist movement. it' b"has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to" b'problems caused by the closure of the territories. today too this' b'concept has two functions: to give a progressive look to the' b'closing of the palestinian population. or in the words of' b'environment minister yossi sarid, "i have no tears for those who' b'get rich off of cheap labor". to furnish an answer to the' b'unemployed israeli who complains of being obliged to work for' b'wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.' b'' b'the israeli government is considering plans to import labor from' b'the far- east to replace native people, palestinians, who work in' b'their own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two' b'ethnical communities and ruling over them.' b''
