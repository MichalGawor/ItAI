b'' b'' b'' b'i recently attended an allery seminar. steroid nasal sprays were' b'discussed. afterward on a one-on-one basis, i asked the speaker what if' b'none of the vancanese, beconase, nasalide, nasalcort, or nasalchrom work' b'nor do any oral decongestants work. she replied that she saw an article on' b'vasomotor rhinitis. that this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing' b"other than the afrin's and such would work. (which in my case is true)." b'' b'i want to find out as much as possible about this, since i am going to see' b'my allergist in may and want to be armed to the hilt with information;' b'since nothing he has done with me has helped me at all and i have had no' b'relief for months.' b'' b'please respond if you know anything about this and/or please let me know' b'what articles might be helpful that i could look up in the library.' b'' b'' b'' b''
