b'' b'' b'not too low perhaps, but surely not as high as that of an european nhl' b'division. the finnish team, for example, would contain all players currently on' b'the national team plus a top-class foreigner or two. they would be in an' b'entirely different league than tps or jokerit, both of whom have perhaps a' b'dozen players of international class if even that. why settle for a minor' b'league when you could have the best?' b'' b'it is no matter what you call the teams, jokerit and tps, or helsinki tornado' b'and turku typhoon, the best palyers in finland would eventually end up in' b'those teams anyway, if they were in the "big" league.' b'' b'' b"i'd rather spend marks to watch the helsinki tornado play montreal, the ny" b'rangers or los angeles than marks(?) for the privilege to see jokerit vs.' b"jypht or even djurgardens if. there's nothing like the nhl, period." b'' b'unrealistic for now. maybe we should first just expand finnish league to' b'allow teams from baltic countries to entry! then others will get interested' b'in the idea, that maybe one should settle something bigger. the ultimate' b'goal, as you want it, would be european division in nhl. btw. does that' b'make a final with an europan team against norht american?' b'' b''
