b'' b"|i am considering buying borland's paradox for windows since i" b"|would like to use a database with windows (i don't have/use" b'|one yet) for both work/home use. i would like to advantage' b'|of borland\'s until april offer if this package' b'|is everything that borland claims it to be. so, i was' b'|wondering has anybody used this and/or have any opinions?' b'' b"yes, and it's pretty much what they claim. i haven't had time to" b"try all of it. considering the price, even if you decide you don't like it," b'it should be saleable over the next months for what you have in it (once' b"the price goes up). all in all it's very serviceable; and in my humble" b'opinion, more powerful than access.'
