b'' b'' b'my suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but stay away from geico!' b'' b"i strongly agree with jeff. here's my horror story. many years back," b'i switched to geico from state farm to save some i have a relatively' b'new sports car, for which we covered with liability, collision, and' b'comprehensive. with this make of car, new models came out in january,' b'not september like other makes. the car was purchased in august of' b'that year.' b'' b'we also had a much older clunker for which we only wanted liability.' b'low and behold, a vandal slashed the roof of the sports car and we put' b'in a claim. this was in october still the current model year for' b'the car. a new top, with installation was we had deductible' b"so we should have gotten you had to go to geico's local office" b'to have an adjuster see the car, unlike state farm that sent the adjusters' b'to the shop or your place. he said, "since the car is now one year' b"old, we'll depreciate the top by so you'll get on the claim." b'this will also count as an accident against you, so your rate may increase."' b'' b'the hassle continued. then we got a letter from geico, saying "claim' b'denied your policy on this car doesn\'t cover this." i then learned' b'that their records had the full coverage (collision, etc.) on our old' b'clunker, and only had liability for this new car!!!! they mixed up' b'our cars in their records. i fixed the top myself with some carpet' b'thread and dropped my claim. they still charged me with an "accident!"' b'i cancelled my policy and switched to another company.' b'' b'the coup de gras came when they sent me a bill for an additional balance' b'due for the difference in collision/comprehensive cost between my sports' b'car and my clunker!!! i returned the bill unpaid with a nastygram,' b'plus explicity directions to perform recto-cranial insertion!!!!' b"haven't heard from them since." b'' b" everyone's entitled to my opinion." b'========imagination is more important than knowledge. albert einstein=======' b'' b'' b'good for you. i am convinced that someone should start a boycott' b'against geico. any takers?' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'*******sig under construction hard hat area********'
