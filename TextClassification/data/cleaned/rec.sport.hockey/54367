b'' b'' b'' b'i am sure some bashers of pens fans are pretty confused about the lack' b'of any kind of posts about the recent pens massacre of the devils. actually,' b'i am bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. however, i am going to put an end' b"to non-pittsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the pens. man, they" b'are killing those devils worse than i thought. jagr just showed you why' b'he is much better than his regular season stats. he is also a lot' b'fo fun to watch in the playoffs. bowman should let jagr have a lot of' b'fun in the next couple of games since the pens are going to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway. i was very disappointed not to see the islanders lose the final' b'regular season game. pens rule!!!' b''
