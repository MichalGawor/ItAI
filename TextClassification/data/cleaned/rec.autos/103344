b'' b"i have both an and an camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions." b"the has about miles on it and the about miles. about" b"a year ago i found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the was" b'leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid' b'back into the passenger compartment of the car. i pulled the plunger and' b'got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought i had the problem' b'licked. much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months' b'later! this time i looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure' b'there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem. i' b"didn't find any. ever since i have been periodically feeding the clutch" b'hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system. i knew i' b"would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the" b'problem.' b'' b"i should add that the clutch is original, and that i've had to adjust the" b'pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in' b'order to actuate the clutch.' b'' b'my hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,' b'the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the' b'cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.' b'' b'what do you think of that as an explanation? can you suggest a possible fix' b'short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?' b'' b"now the same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain" b'why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the' b'passenger compartment) while i was on vacation for days, during which' b'the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort. what' b'can you suggest here?' b'' b"many thanks. let's hope i don't end up going to click and clack on this..." b'' b'bill christens-barry' b''
