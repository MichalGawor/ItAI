b'the program loads images with a minimum resolution of by a pixel' b'depth of or bits, and one image plane. standard input and' b'output formats include pict, tiff, satie, and aipd. other formats can' b'be imported.' b'' b'image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial' b'linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic' b'operations, and geometric transformations, among others. morphological' b'transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole' b'removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.' b"quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and" b'morphological distribution. measures include area, perimeter, center of' b'gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length

command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity' b'is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot. the histogram tool can' b'be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. the twenty-eight' b'arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging' b'sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc. there are' b'13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local' b'intensity. these include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.' b'the frequency data resulting from fft analysis can be displayed as' b'either the (real imaginary components or the (phase, magnitude)' b'data. the morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening' b'and defining objects or for removing artifacts.' b'' b'the transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even' b'hole filling.' b'' b"the program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area," b'perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.'

enhancing and measuring distances in' b'radiographs.' b'' b'image analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video' b'analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of' b'instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine' b'density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature' b'extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically. image analyst' b'works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or' b'a disk-stored image.' b'' b'within minutes, without the need for programming, the image analyst user' b'can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.' b'measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically' b'generated from tiff or pict files or from captured video tape images.' b'image analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and' b'position. the tool provides direct support for the data translation and' b'scion frame

the processing, measurements and analysis that the user' b'defines. automated sequences are set up in regions of interest (roi)' b'represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image. inside a roi, the' b'program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,' b'the thickness of a wall, etc. image analyst finds the center, edge and' b'other positions automatically. the application

include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and' b'supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and' b'principal component analysis. disimp also supports the more

look up tables,' b'colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be' b'interactively driven through this control.' b'' b'a range of geographic projections enables disimp to integrate data of' b'image, graphic and textual types. images can be rectified by a number of' b'coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential' b'for ground truthing. overlays of grids, text and vector data can be' b'added to further enhance referenced imagery.' b'' b'the system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels' b'to determine their own working

b'michael landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image' b'processing which has been used for basically all the usual image' b'processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite,

both by additions from us as well' b'as a huge user-contributed library.' b'' b'feature description' b'' b'hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide' b'a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research,' b'system development and teaching. it handles sequences of images' b'(movies) in precisely the same manner as single frames.' b'' b'programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image' b'transformations, filtering, convolution, fourier and other transform' b'processing, edge detection and line drawing manipulation, digital' b'image compression and transmission methods, noise generation, and image' b'statistics computation. over such image transformation programs' b'have been developed. as a result, almost any image processing task' b'can be performed quickly and conveniently. additionally, hips allows' b'users to easily integrate their own custom routines. new users' b'become effective using hips on their first day.' b'' b'hips features images that are self-documenting. each image stored in' b'the system contains a history of the transformations that have been' b'applied to that image. hips includes a small set of subroutines' b'which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header, and' b'a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix' b"``filters''. it comes complete with source code, on-line manual" b'pages, and on-line documentation.' b'' b'host configuration requirements' b'' b'originally developed at new york university, hips now represents' b'one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing' b'environments currently available. it runs under the unix operating' b'system. it is modular and flexible, provides automatic documentation' b'of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.' b'hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and' b'microvax, sun, apollo, masscomp, ncr tower, iris, ibm at, etc.' b'for image display and input, drivers are supplied for the grinnell and' b'adage (ikonas) image processors, and the sun-2, sun-3, sun- and' b'sun-386i consoles. we also supply user-contributed drivers for a' b'number of other framestores and windowing packages (sun gfx, sun' b'console, matrox vip-1024, iti ip-512, lexidata, macintosh ii, x' b'windowing system, and iris). the hipsaddon package includes an' b'interface for the crs-4000. it is a simple matter to interface hips' b'with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with' b'users who have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max-' b'video. hips can be easily adapted for other image display devices' b'because of hips is machine independent.' b'' b'availability' b'' b'hips has proven itself a highly flexible system, both as an' b'interactive research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. it' b'is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. hips' b'is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format (either reel- to-reel or' b'sun cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of' b'convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.' b'' b'michael
