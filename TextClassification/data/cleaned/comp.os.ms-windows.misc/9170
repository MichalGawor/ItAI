b'' b'' b'i am having a problem configuring the mouse in windows to use com3' b'with irq5.' b'' b'com1 and com2 are being used to support two hour bbs lines,' b'' b"there you go. com1 and com3 use the same irq, therefore you can't use" b"a mouse on com3 and a modem on com1, or vice versa. it's a limitation" b'of dos.' b'' b'and in fact windows will not see a mouse on anything other than com1' b'or com2. accept this fact, and either get a bus mouse, or get a new' b'computer.' b'' b'i would also like to know if it is possible to use the mouse on ports other' b'than com1 or com2.' b'' b'no. the advice above applies....' b'--' b'greg franklin'
