b'' b"there's this old se here. it's got the older-style fans that remind" b'me of a house-ventilator. a cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor' b'i usually see. anyway, the se makes this loud buzzing noise due' b'to vibration somewheres. if i remove the screws and loosen the front' b'from the back, it quiets down. i can only assume that the fan housing' b'from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating' b'against it.' b'' b'anyway, any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to' b'"stealth" this guy? your experiences welcome.....' b'' b'--' b'"if everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect."' b'\t-batf spokesperson on cnn regarding failed raid attempt in tx.' b'' b'' b'when i owned an se, i replaced the fan with se silencer, available, i' b'believe, from macwarehouse or macconnection. it comes with instruction for' b'installation and requires no soldering. worked like a charm. i think the' b'manufacturer is mobius.' b'' b'__dave' b'' b'--' b''
