b'' b'' b'' b'some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is' b"listening in on everything and one will have to hide one's clipper messages" b'somehow if non-escrowed crypto goes away.' b'' b'a little perspective might be in order.' b'' b'the number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low. law enforcement has to' b'present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of' b'authorizations.' b'' b'thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor' b'recorded by the government, and for that to happen they have to:' b'a) have a pretty good reason, with evidence;' b'b) use this sparingly on highest priority "pretty good reasons."' b'' b'though the system may be imperfect, it is a long way from the horror stories' b'some here seem to believe or anticipate.' b'' b'--' b'david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of' b' our information, errors and omissions excepted.' b'' b'again we have the trust in government problem here. members of' b"mr. sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which" b'members of my generation find ridiculous. i would suggest that mr. sternlight' b'read about the cointelpro program, or about j. edgar hoover, or about' b'the wire-tapping of martin luther king, then, after he has digested this' b'information he can ponder the fact that while the government does not' b'tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations' b'that they have no right to, even under their own laws. given the long' b'history of members of the us government ignoring the laws that apply' b'to them, it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid, and' b'given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these' b'individuals once they are discovered, it is no wonder that so many people' b'in here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for clipper.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'jamie jamison'
