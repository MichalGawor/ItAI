b'' b'date: wed, apr gmt' b'' b'' b' this morning at am while i was working on my research paper, i had to' b' reboot a hung dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within windows b' when my machine finished rebooting, i found my windows directory and about two' b' thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.' b'' b'(stuff deleted)' b'' b'this sounds like what happened to my hd a month ago. my hd was stacked' b'with stacker v.2.0 (i run dos5) suddenly everything hung up, and most of' b'the hd got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with' b"'funny' names). in other words: it is probably just the doubledisk part of" b'dos6 that is troublesome.' b'' b'i now use stacker v and so far i have had no trouble.' b'' b'does this need to have anything to do with disk compression? i have' b'experienced the same thing a couple of times myself, but *without* any disk' b'compression stuff installed. (for example, guess what happened when norton' b'speeddisk once crashed during defragmenting!)' b'' b'bjorn-' b'' b'* b'sintef safety and reliability n-7034 trondheim, norway' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------' b'sintef the foundation for scientific and industrial research' b'at the norwegian institute of technology' b'* b'' b''
