b'' b'' b"i am considering buying borland's paradox for windows since i" b"would like to use a database with windows (i don't have/use" b'one yet) for both work/home use. i would like to advantage' b'of borland\'s until april offer if this package' b'is everything that borland claims it to be. so, i was' b'wondering has anybody used this and/or have any opinions?' b'' b'-- tom belmonte' b'' b'if you are interested in a program which is very easy to use, i strongly' b'suggest approach it is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc. i' b'own both it and paradox, and i almost never use paradox. if you need to' b'build up a complicated application, then paradox is the way to go. i have' b'heard horror stories about the access programming being extremely cryptic.' b'since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/' b'home use and you have not used a database before), i recommend approach. i' b'have found only one small thing which i would like it to do more easily:' b'i have one database where the order in which the records are entered must' b'be different than what is the logical ordering. to permanently reorder (to' b'use the old dbase iii command) the records requires sorting the records' b'appropriately (no problem, since i almost always use them in this order)' b'exporting the database to another database (which can still be an approach' b'database), and then copying the exported files back to the original' b'filename. this is a small weakness, considering the other items i really' b'like about approach. it is also a little slower than paradox (other than' b'the loading, paradox takes forever and a minute to load). paradox also' b'takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12mb) and ram).' b'' b''
