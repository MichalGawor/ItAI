b'' b"i bought a yamaha xs850 with 8k miles. over the last years, i've put 30k" b'of commute miles onnit. valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every' b"5k. well every 7.5k or so, i've checked the pad clearences, and they never" b'change! if anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which' b'makes no sense to me with the pad system the pads should wear until the' b'clearances are too great right? i know that threaded adjusters can tighten' b"up, but i didn't think these kind could." b'' b"bottom lines is that i haven't touched my valves for 30k on this bike and" b'they are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter...' b"what's the deal? any other yam triple owners notice extremely long valve" b'adjustment intervals?'
