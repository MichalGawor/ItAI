b'' b'' b'yo, did anybody see this run of hard copy?' b'' b'i guy on a katana got pulled over by the police (i guess for' b'speeding or something). but just as the cop was about to step' b'out of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in georgia.' b'ang then, the cop gives chase.' b'' b'now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!!' b'everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet' b'battle at about 100mph. what happened at the end? the guy (who is' b'being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights)' b'slows a couple of times to taunt the cop. after blowing a few stop' b'signs and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.' b'' b'the kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance' b'machine and he slams on the brakes. of couse, we all know that cages,' b"especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our" b'high performance machines. so what happens?... the cage plows into the' b'kat.' b'' b'luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt. but' b"dude, how crazy can you get!?! yeah, we've all went out and played" b'cat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!! how crazy can' b'you get!?!?! it took just one look at a zx-7 who tried this crap' b'to convince me not to try any shit like that.
