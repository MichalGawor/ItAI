b'' b'radar (radio association defending airwave rights) says that geico' b"insurance not only buy's radar for police but also actively lobbies" b'states to promote making radar detectors illegal. i think the' b'buying part is a misuse of money but the radar detector part shows' b'how little they know about the issue. no study i am aware of has ever' b'concluded that detectors have a negative impact on safety or that' b'users have a higher average speed. incompetence by geico? i think' b'so.' b'' b'' b'troy wecker' b'sequent computer systems' b'beaverton, or' b'' b'' b"i'm considering switching to geico insurance, but have heard that" b'they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim. i was' b'worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim. i have' b'also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident.' b'' b"i've read in this group that geico has funded the purchasing of radar" b"guns by police depts (i'm not sure where)."
