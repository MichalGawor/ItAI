b'' b'' b'*** quoting drieux, just drieux to all dated b'' b' my point, if it alluded you, is that as long' b' as the usa remains in the state of rebellion' b" against god's divinely appointed vicar over" b' these colonies, what more can you expect from' b" paganidolators alienated from god's wonderful plan???" b'' b'' b' obgeopoliticalcontext: i was pleased that the' b" restoration of the bourbon de bourbon's to" b'what tree did you just climb down from, the church is an opressive farce which' b'destroys cultures. i\'m not knocking religious "morality", but i think that' b'americans take their religion too seriously to the point of trying to convert' b"anyone or anything to their particular sect. it's a question of power and not" b'salvation... all monotheistic religions breed intoleraance into their flock' b'(islam, judaism, and christianity). religion is not the opiate of the masses,' b"fanaticism is and brother, it lookes like you're pretty hopped up on your own" b'self-rightousness.' b'' b'' b'never heard of arguement by absurdity, eh no? also called' b'sarcasm. the usual procedure is to accept some part of the' b"'oppositions' arguement and run with it until one goes" b"beyond 'rational thought' and then ring the changes." b'' b'z.b. the idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one.' b'and in these times of economic difficulty, the washington' b'legislature is propossing to raise the state minwage from' b'$4.25 (the federal level) to (fifteen cents over' b"oregon's)." b'it would seem to me that this increase does not' b'keep pace with inflation, that the minimum wage should be' b'to by my figures, so it is proposed that we raise' b'the minimum wage to per hour by july and then give' b'a cost of living increase every july.' b'' b"and anyone who doesn't like it is obviously a country club" b'republican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people.' b'' b'chus' b'pyotr' b'' b'--' b'optimist: bagpiper with a beeper.'
