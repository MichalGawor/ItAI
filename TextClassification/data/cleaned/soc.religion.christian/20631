b'' b'' b'' b'my guess is that the "lazarus, come out!" was also for the sake of the' b'crowd.' b'' b"i read somewhere, i think in morton smith's _jesus the magician_, that" b"old lazarus wasn't dead, but going in the tomb was part of an initiation" b'rite for a magi-cult, of which jesus was also a part. it appears that' b'a 3-day stay was normal. i wonder b'' b"[i haven't read that book, but another one by smith in which similar" b"claims were made about jesus. while i'm sure smith knows more about" b'early chrisitanity than i do, i found his arguments similar to those' b'of books like "holy blood, holy grail" building conjectures on top' b"of other conjectures. there was no direct evidence. if you'd like" b"to summarize the argument for us, i'd be happy to see it. but in" b"doing so, i'd like you to pay careful attention to the nature of" b'the evidence. --clh]'
