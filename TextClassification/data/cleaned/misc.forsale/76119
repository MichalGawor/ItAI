b'' b'' b'' b'| does anyone know what the jumpers should be set to on the maxtor b'| i have a that came off of a vs2000 that i would like to use on a pc.' b'' b'\t[ useful info about the maxtor drive deleted b'' b'since the 3b1 "normally" has only one hd, you would jumper betwwwn "c1" to' b'select the first (possible) drive address; if the is your second drive' b'on the 3b1, then jumper between "2c".' b'' b'\thowever, thad, you should note that he said that he would like to' b"use it on a 'pc', not 'unix-pc'. also note the strange cross-posting (as he" b'probably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends' b'to mount it on. if it *is* a pc (or clone), then the "2c" jumper would be' b'the correct choice.' b'' b"\ti've left the cross-posting in effect, since i'm not sure which" b'newsgroup he would really be reading this in. b'' b'' b'sorry for any confusion i may have created. the disk did come out of' b'a vs2000 and i would like to use it in a ibm pc clone. the reason that i' b'posted to comp.sys.3b1 was because i saw the drive (xt2190) mentioned' b"in a for-slae notice. i had asked for info before but didn't receive" b'any replies.' b'' b'thanks once again for the help.' b'' b'colin.'
