b'' b'undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons, but i suspect that a biggie' b'is that the god they\'ve believed in is (in j.b. phillips\'s words) "too small".' b"if a person's understanding of god is not allowed to grow and develop, it will" b'eventually become inadequate. the grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a' b'comforting image in childhood becomes a joke.' b'' b'a therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they "fire' b'god". what she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of' b'god to make room for a fuller one. but she follows up by encouraging them to' b'"hire a new one". my guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing' b'process, but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re-hire.' b'' b'billh'
