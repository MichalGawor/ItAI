b'' b'| instead, use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by times' b'| or something like that.' b"... wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold? my gut feeling is that, as a" b'mechanically resonating device, extreme cold is likely to affect the' b'compliance (?terminology?) of the quartz, and hence its resonant frequency.' b'' b'yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. is only a smidgen of the' b"distance to absolute zero. and in any case you're going to have to" b'borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this' b"darling anyway. btw, you're probably going to want those big capacitors" b'you found to fire the solenoid high current drain on frozen batteries' b'can be an ugly thing.' b'' b'paul'
