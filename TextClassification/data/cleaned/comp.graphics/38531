b'' b'' b'|' b'| the idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not' b'| necessarily rectangular) as a window. my problem then is in' b'| finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons"' b'| from the first one. is this simply a matter of extending the' b'| usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked' b'| against another polygon??? is there a simpler way??' b'|' b'| comments welcome.' b'|' b'| noel.' b'' b'it depends on what kind of the polygons.' b'convex simple, concave trouble, concave with loop(s)' b'inside big trouble.' b'' b'of cause, you can use the box test to avoid checking' b'each edges. according to my experience, there is not' b'a simple way to go. the headache stuff is to deal with' b'the special cases, for example, the overlapped lines.' b'' b'yeh' b'usc'
