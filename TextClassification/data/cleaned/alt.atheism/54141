b'' b'what i want is a response' b'giving me the pros and cons of metaphorical religious language. could an' b'atheist accept this view without giving up the foundamentals of what he' b'believes in?' b'' b'could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or' b'tradition is viewed in a metaphorical way? of course: this is' b'essentially what we do with homer, or with other concepts such as' b'fate, luck, free will however, there remains the question of' b'whether the religious literature of say christianity is a' b"particularly *good* set of metaphors for the world today. it's also" b'entirely unclear, and to me quite unlikely, that one could take a' b'contemporary religion like that and divorce the metaphoric potential' b'from the literalism and absolutism it carries now in many cases.' b'--' b'these are my opinions. for a nominal fee, they can be yours.'
