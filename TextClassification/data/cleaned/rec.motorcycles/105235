b'' b'' b' i plan to switch to a single fire ignition in about a month and was' b' curious if anyone has experience with the supposedly new crane single' b' fire that competes with the dyna-s. the club wrench (not the wench) has' b" done dyna-s modules for several friends and i'll get one also unless" b' a bunch of folks say the crane is better.' b'' b' one guy just installed the mc power arc ignition but has not yet' b' reported the results. it was not a simple bolt-in replacement as new' b' mounting holes had to be drilled.' b'' b" i recognize it's more fun to discuss why chris needed to change brands of" b" penis enhancer but how 'bout some comments on single fire ignitions for" b' a while...' b'' b'i just installed a mc power arc ii, and it seems to run great. i also' b'used mc coils, and neither the ignition module or the coils required' b'any new mounting holes to be drilled on my fxstc. a little soldering' b'and all was fine. static timing was real easy to set too.' b'' b'on the other side of the coin, my local wrench, whose opinion i' b'invariably seek but don\'t always adopt, thinks mc power arc is a "piece' b'of shit" and says "all them jap chips are gonna fail you one day".' b"needless to say, he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules, and" b"recommends the dyna-s system. i think that's the one with the" b'hall-effect timing sensor(s), correct?' b'' b"russ hughes fxstc dod# 6022(10e20)" b'"the chrome and steel she rides.....collidin\' with the very air she' b'breathes..."' b'-- n. young'
