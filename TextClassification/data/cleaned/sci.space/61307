b'' b"i didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, i" b'just wanted to add a point.' b'' b'the whole question of "a right to a dark sky" revolves around the' b'definition of a right. moral rights and natural rights are all well and' b'good, but as far as i can see, a right is whatever you or someone' b'representing you can enforce. in most civilizations, the government or' b'the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and' b'then enforces those rights for them. here in the u.s., the constitution' b'provides a "bill of rights" from which most if not all legal rights are' b"considered to derive. i'm sure that most other countries have" b'comparable documents. if you can persuade a court that you have a right' b'to a dark sky derived in some manner from the bill of rights (in the' b'u.s.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched. to' b'keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law' b'and the international court of justice (correct name?) in the hague,' b'something i know little about.' b'' b'doug loss'
