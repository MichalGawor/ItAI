b'' b'' b'on my pc i almost exclusively run windows. the only dos based application' b'i have is procommplus. in my config.sys i have emm386 loaded with the' b'option noems (no expanded memory). following a thread in one of the comp' b'newsgroups, i read that it was no necessary to have emm386 loaded. indeed,' b'in the manual, it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out of' b'extended memory. since i have the noems option, it seems to me that the' b'emm386 device is useless in my case.' b'' b'should i use emm386 or should i remove it from my config.sys?' b'' b'thanks for your help,' b'' b'-eric'
