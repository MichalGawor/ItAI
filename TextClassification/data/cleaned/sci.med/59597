b'' b'-*----' b'sci.med removed from followups. (and i do not read any of the' b'other newsgroups.)' b'' b'-*----' b' as a self-proclaimed atheist my position is that i _believe_ that' b" there is no god. i don't claim to have any proof. i interpret" b" the agnostic position as having no beliefs about god's existence." b'' b"that's fine. these words have multiple meanings." b'' b'as a self-proclaimed atheist, i believe that *some* conceptions' b'of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and i lack' b'belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no' b'reason for me to believe in these. i usually use the word' b'agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of' b'a god is unknown inherently unknowable. note that this is a' b'positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a' b'god; i do not believe in a god, but i also do not believe the' b'agnostic claim.' b'' b'russell'
