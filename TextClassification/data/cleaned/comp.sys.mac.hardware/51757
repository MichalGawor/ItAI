b'' b'i just hooked up my mac iisi to a relatively old year?) asante en/sc' b'adapter. the 10base-t connection works like a charm. i installed the' b"newest drivers from asante's ftp server." b'' b'the problem begins when i attach one more device to the scsi chain b'specifically a 50mb drive. i power up the drive, then the mac. the mac' b'tests memory, etc. just before the "happy mac face" normally shows up, the' b'power light on the en/sc goes out, and the boot process stops. so i can use' b'the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. this makes the' b'asante box pretty much unusable.' b'' b"it doesn't look like a purely electrical scsi problem, because if i turn" b"on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed" b'during the initial scsi polling, the mac boots normally and the adapter' b'works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. the mac has' b"*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and i've had" b'it for over a year).' b'' b"here is what i tried: changing the scsi id's of the en/sc and the disk b'several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the en/sc at the' b'head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator' b'(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal' b'resistors from the hard disk; trying another en/sc box; trying another' b'identical drive; trying several different scsi cables.' b'' b'has anybody seen this? more importantly, does anyone have a solution?' b'thanks a lot. e.' b'' b'--' b'eric behr, illinois state university, mathematics department'
