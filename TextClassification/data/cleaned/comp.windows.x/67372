b'' b'these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these' b'specific questions.' b'' b'1. if my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?' b'my choices are to call xgetmodifiermapping() for each key press with a' b'modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers' b"in a lookup table. i would like to do it the second way, but i can't seem to" b'get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers. i know that' b'when an app calls xsetmodifiermapping() a mappingnotify event is generated' b"(non-maskable) which i can pick up and modify my internal table. but, i don't" b'seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap. if i use xt, all' b"o'reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by xt...'. if i use xlib, ala xnextevent(), i get nothing. this all stems from problems with users of" b'the sun keyboard and the numlock; plus various alt/meta/etc. modifier' b'requirements.' b'' b'2. i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right' b'of my main window. i want it at the same y coord, and their right/left' b'sides touching. what i need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window' b"manager's border for the main window. this should ring a bell with anyone" b'who has called xtmovewidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move' b'and seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y' b'and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border.' b'' b'any help would be most appreciated.' b'' b'darcy'
