b'' b'' b'while i have gotten years out of this digital receiver, it' b'has been acting verry strange of late. i hope that the following' b'symptoms may help someone diagnose the error:' b'' b'- i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had has long died' b"thus if i unplug it it won't remember the presets" b'' b"- it has given up listening to the remote. (i tried changing the remote's" b'batteries) when i try a remote function the receiver registers that it' b'received it (a green remote light flashes) but the right function' b"doesn't happen if any function at all. (also strange- when i hit" b'the "mute" button, for example, the display panel goes black yikes-' b"i've never seen that before b'' b'- before all the strangeness started, the system turned itself off and on' b'again by itself' b'' b"- sometimes it won't play a radio station, so i have to kinda twist it" b'(yes kinda flex the motherboard, chasis) for it to get the radio' b'tuning back the aux in function always works however....' b'' b'it is inconvenient, but not inconvenient enough to pay an' b"expensive repair fee. while, i'm not a hardware guy, i wonder" b'if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix.' b'the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go b'' b'someone told me this unit series has a bad voltage amp chip.' b'' b'-anyway ...arghh' b'-cjk' b''
