b'' b'' b' can you please offer some recommendations?' b'' b"it's really not that hard to do. there are books out there which explain" b'everything, and the basic 3d functions, translation, rotation, shading, and' b'hidden line removal are pretty easy. i wrote a program in a few weeks witht' b'he help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source.' b'' b'i think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel.' b'' b"yes, i want to concentrate on other development issues i've created graphics" b"libraries before, it's too time consuming... life's too short!" b'' b'\talso, quickdraw has a lot of 3d functions built in, and think pascal' b'can access them, and i would expect that think c could as well. if you can' b'find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent' b'choice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the mac, so should be' b'fast.' b'' b'just to clarify, the 3d routines that are mentioned in various places' b'on the mac are in a libray, not the rom of the mac. a few years ago before' b'i knew anything about implementing graphics, i came across a demo of the' b'apple grafsys3d library and it actually did a lot. however, it is quite' b"limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3d library; your code still has" b'to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum. it has nothing' b'on gl, for example, where you can handle objects.' b'' b'thanks for the clarification... before posting my original request i had looked' b"into the mac's 3d capabilities and dismissed them as low grade." b'' b'bobc' b''
