b'' b'when elizabeth greeted mary, elizabeth said something to the effect that' b'mary, out of all women, was blessed. if so, it appears that this' b'exactly places mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity.' b'' b'i remember a couple of times when my ex-girlfriend said that she thought she' b"was blessed because of her son (whom she loved dearly). in fact, i've heard" b"people refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times. it's a common" b'figure of speech. considering that elizabeth was just another human, i think' b'this passage offers nothing towards justifying the "blessedness" of mary.'
