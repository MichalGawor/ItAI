b'' b'' b'' b'but they can put out a lot of particulate matter. i heard' b'something about legislation being discussed to "clean up' b'diesel emissions". is there anything in the works to' b'install "scrubbers" for diesels? how about the feasibility' b'of installing them on trucks and cars? would it be any' b"different than a catylitic converter? i'd assume easier," b"since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting" b"gasses. let's hear people's opinions..." b'' b'the technology cummins is applying to diesels to comply with' b'the newer ca. emissions laws involves three things i know of:' b'' b'1. all compliant diesels are turbocharged.' b'2. all use an "aftercooler", which cools the air which was heated' b'by compression by the turbocharger (up to about psi).' b'3. a gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air' b'intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is' b'low.' b'' b'no scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used. the path from' b'the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.' b'' b'interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output' b'and mileage are enhanced by these measures. one can buy aftermarket' b'turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,' b'and these are approved by the carb.' b'' b'dan hepner'
