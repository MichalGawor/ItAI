b'' b' is it possible to do a "wheelie" on a motorcycle with shaft-drive?' b'' b'\tyes, but the _rear_ wheel comes off the ground, not the front.' b' see, it just hops into the air! figure.' b'john stafford' b'' b'sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. i had a bmw r100rs' b"that was a wheelie monster! of course it didn't have the initial power" b'burst to just twist it into the air i had to pop the clutch. i also' b'had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. the fairing is a' b'bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the' b'time. but let me give you fair warning: i trashed the ring/pinion gear' b'in the final drive of my k75 (i assume) doing wheelies. and this was' b'no cheap fix either!! there is some kind of "slip" device in the shaft' b"to prevent it from breaking. unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!" b'' b'on the topic of wheelies, the other day i saw a kid on a big hurricane' b'do a "stoppy"(?), or rear wheelie. man, he had the rear end on this bike' b"up about feet off the ground at a traffic light. i don't recommend these" b'activities anymore (now that i\'m an "old guy" with kids of my own) but' b'it looked damn impressive!!' b'' b"if you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed" b'in that direction! b'' b'cheers,' b'b**2'
