b'' b'what kind of polygons? shaded? texturemapped? hm? more comes into play with' b'fast routines than just "polygons". it would be nice to know exaclty what' b'system (vga is a start, but what processor?) and a few of the specifics of the' b'implementation. you need to give more info if you want to get any answers! :p' b'' b"i don't want texture mapped, cause if i did i'd asked for them. just" b"a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons. as for the processor, it'd" b"be for a minimum of a maybe if i can't find a good one for 286s." b'ideally, i want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport,' b'and write to an arbitrary location in memory. of course the chances of' b"finding something like that are pretty remote, so i guess i'd need the source" b"with it. oh, and i guess it would need to be in asm otherwise it'd be too" b"slow. i've seen some polygon routines in c, and they've all been waaay too" b"slow. its for a 3d vector graphics program. i've been hunting high and low" b"for a polyn function in asm, and i can't find one anywhere that i can use." b"i've found one or two polyn functions, but my asm is pretty bad, so i won't" b'even try to rewrite them. b'//lucas.'
