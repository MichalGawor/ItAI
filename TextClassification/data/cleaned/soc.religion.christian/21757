b'' b'(stephen a. creps) writes:' b'' b'the catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free' b'will in any way. since god knows everything, he therefore knows' b'everything that is going to happen to us. we have free will, and' b'are able to change what happens to us. however, since god knows' b'everything, he knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (god' b'is not subject to time). too often arguments pit predestination' b'against free will. we believe in both.' b'' b"that last sentence of steve's is an important one to remember." b'' b'there are certain things in the catholic religion that cannot be' b'completely comprehended by a human being. were this not the case, it' b'would be good evidence that the religion was man-made.' b'' b'in the case of predestination, you have to reconcile two things that' b"would at first appear to be irreconcilable: the sovereignty of god's" b"will over all things, and man's free will in deciding his own fate." b"catholics believe in both! but that doesn't mean that anyone has come" b'up with a pat reconciliation...' b'' b"i have often thought that goedel's famous theorem has applicability to" b'catholic dogma, at least in an analogous sense: there are things that' b"are true that cannot be proved. god's intellect is far above ours." b'there are many truths that we will never be able to understand.'
