b'' b' i am reposting this because i am not sure my first post ever made it out.' b' i have built and installed x11r5 on my sparcstation my aim is to run' b' the mit x server but retain the openlook window manager. i am sure this' b' is not uncommon, but i just want to make sure that i change and/or delete' b' everything that i need to. for instance, i can start xdm in rc.local, but' b' how do i get rid of xnews?' b'' b'' b' the openlook window manager source is available on the mit contrib tapes' b' or from export.lcs.mit.edu .i would suggest building this too, rather than' b' using the version from openwindows. it is olwm v3.' b'' b'' b'i would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. this version of the' b'olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that i find really handy even' b'on large monitors.' b'' b'this version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.z.' b'the readme file also suggest getting the files in /contrib/xview3.' b'' b'in my case, i built the x server first, xview second, then olvwm. all of these' b'were installed into /usr/x5. once i verified the server worked correctly,' b'i happily issued "rm -rf /usr/openwin/*".' b'' b'using gcc to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that' b'is, for all intents and purposes, identical to openwindows and that is' b'incredibly faster. there is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want' b'things to work _exactly_ like openwindows, but not much.' b'' b'--' b'paul bash techware design'
