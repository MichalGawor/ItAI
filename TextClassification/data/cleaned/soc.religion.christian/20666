b'' b'' b" i'm concerned about a recent posting about wbt/sil. i thought they'd" b'pretty much been denounced as a right-wing organization involved in' b'ideological manipulation and cultural interference, including vietnam' b'and south america. a commission from mexican academia denounced them in' b'1979 as a covert political and ideological institution used by the' b'u.s. govt as an instrument of control, regulation, penetration, espionage and' b'repression."' b'' b'having met peter kingston (of wbt) some years back, he struck me' b'as an exemplery and dedicated christian whose main concern was with' b'translation of the word of god and the welfare of the people' b'group he was serving.' b'wbt literature is concerned mainly with providing scripture' b'in minority languages.' b'' b'the sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this' b'along the lines of "ideological manipulation and cultural' b'interference" is probably no more than christianising and' b'education in this wbt will stand alongside the early christian' b'missionaries to parts of africa, or those groups who worked' b'among native americans a couple hundred years ago.' b'' b' my concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even' b"praiseworthy by readers of soc.religion.christian. it's important that" b'christians don\'t immediately accept every "christian" organization as' b'automatically above reproach.' b'' b' mp' b'i think you need to substantiate these attacks as being a' b'legitimate criticism of priorities other than spreading the' b'gospel among underdeveloped people.' b'' b'barney resson' b'"many shall run to and fro, knowledge shall increase" (daniel)'
