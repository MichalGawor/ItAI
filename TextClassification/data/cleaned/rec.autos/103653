b'' b'i prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be. i believe that automatics' b'should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise' b'would not be able to drive. automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.' b'more time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery' b'instead of concentrating on the road. the manual transmission keeps the drive' b"always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement. plus, driving should" b'be fun! driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.' b'in the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster' b"that any human could move a stick. if i was racing, i'd want and automatic. for" b'normal driving go with the manual.'
