b'' b'as a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the us while' b'here in europe they are rare??? just wondering.....' b'' b'primarily milage. gas is much more expensive, so people are very' b'concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer. this,' b'along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with' b"smaller engines. these engines usually don't have the torque to mesh" b"well with an automatic. so, having engines that don't work well with" b'autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual euro-car has a' b'manual.' b'' b"(note that not many big benzes come with manuals. if you've got the" b"money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to" b'drive through the slushbox.)' b'' b'as automatics become more efficient, the "bigotry" is probably' b'reduced. still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are' b'cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel. so there' b"aren't compelling reasons to go automatic." b'' b'-db' b'' b'--'
