b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'ok. i donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. however,' b'i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who' b'have the right for it.' b'' b'sounds like wishful guessing.' b'' b'' b'as for the arabian and palestinean voices that are against the' b'current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they' b'are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions' b'that israel would not give an inch of the west bank (and most probably the same' b'for golan heights) back to the arabs. an months of "negotiations" in madrid,' b'and washington proved these predictions. now many will jump on me saying why' b'are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.' b'i would say why would the arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to' b'loose b'' b'' b"'so-called' what do you mean how would you see the peace process?" b'' b"so you say palestineans do not negociate because of 'well-founded' predictions b"how do you know that they are 'well founded' if you do not test them at the" b"table months did not prove anything, but it's always the other side at" b'fault, right b'' b"why i do not know why, but if, let's say, the palestineans (some of them) want" b'all israel, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis.' b'' b'or, maybe they (palestinenans) are not yet ready for statehood b'' b'or, maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership, too many' b'fractions aso b'' b'i am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one, but any of' b'these could make arabs stall the negotiations.' b'' b'arabs feel that the current "negotiations" is only for legitimizing the current' b'status-quo and for opening the doors of the arab markets for israeli trade and' b'"oranges". that is simply unacceptable and would be revoked.' b'' b'i like california oranges. and the feelings may get sharper at the table.' b'' b'' b'' b'regards,' b'' b'dorin'
