b'' b'' b'' b" i'm considering modernizing some old wiring in my home, and" b' i need a little advice on outlet wiring. several outlets' b" are the old 'two prong' type, without the ground. naturally," b' the wire feeding these outlets is without the ground' b' wire. i noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the' b' with ground, and that on these circuits, the ground' b' wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral (white) wire.' b'' b' this is contrary to the electrical code and should be fixed.' b'' b'well, my house was built just last year, and the breaker box is wired the' b'same way.' b'' b'there should be a connection of the ground wire to a ground' b'in the breaker box. there also should be a connection of the neutral' b'wire to a ground in the breaker box. there should be no other' b'place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in' b'any of the outlet boxes).' b'' b"the neutral (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for" b'the plug, and is not safe to touch, while the ground (green)' b"wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless" b"some kind of electrical fault has occurred. it's safe" b'to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the' b'grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding' b'conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground' b'potential as its breaker-box end).' b'' b'john whitmore'
