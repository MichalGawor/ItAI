b'' b"i don't know if anyone has posted a message like this yet, but i'm" b'getting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey' b'game, in which the score was just tied, and then cutting out and saying' b'"sorry we can\'t show you this we have to show baseball tonight" (not' b'even a game. a friggin highlight show).' b'gee, sure would have been nice to see the isles/caps in overtime.' b"i live in pittsburgh (yes i'm a pens fan) where hockey gets a lot" b'of coverage. i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in texas' b'must feel.'
