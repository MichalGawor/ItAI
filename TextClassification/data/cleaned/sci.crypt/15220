(the _phone_ company keeps records, but this' b'information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave' b'relay station).' b'' b'this raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications' b'encryption key. will it be something that is derived from information' b'exchanged at the start of the conversation and hence derivable by' b'an eavesdropper?' b'' b'--' b'bear giles'
