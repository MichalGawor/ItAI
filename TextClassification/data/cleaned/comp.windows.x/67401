b'' b'' b'hi ppl,' b'' b'i am running xfree386 under linux sls1.0 and am trying to get the german' b'keyboard working. i have already recompiled my kernel and the german' b'keyboard in the textmode works just fine.' b'i have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for x' b'called xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/x11, so i ran xmodmap /usr/lib/x11/xmodmap.gr.' b'my first impression was very good, i was able to get z and y straight b"there's still a little problem i can't solve however:" b'i cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets.' b"the alt-gr key doesn't seem to work." b'i tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does.' b'looking up its keycode in the xmodmap i found the entry "mode_switch"' b"which doesn't ring any bell. the entries for the keys i cannot use seem" b'to be correct. example: keycode xx ssharp questn backslash' b'the first entries i can even get at. the first one is the unmodified' b'key and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd??' b"my guess is that it should be the key with alt-gr but it isn't." b'if anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them,' b'help would be appreciated.' b'' b'cu' b'' b'alaric'
