b'' b':' b': hello,' b':' b': i recently tried to print some envelopes using amipro with my' b': deskjet printer, and i seem to be having a problem. what' b': happens is after i physically load the envelope into the printer' b': (per the user manual) and then select the "print envelope" icon' b': from amipro (all of the proper options have been selected), the' b': printer just "spits out" the envelope without any printing of' b': either a return address or the selected mailing address. at' b': this point, the printer\'s "online" light begins to flash, and' b': the print manager shows the printer job as busy. this is all' b': that happens, until i either shut the printer off or cancel the' b': printing job from the print manager. i have also tried this' b': without the use of the print manager, with similar results' b': (amipro shows the printer as being busy). so, does anybody' b': have any idea/solution regarding this problem? i appreciate' b': the help. thanks.' b'' b"yes ignore the manual. just insert the evelope don't use the keypad" b'to move it up. the windows driver sends a message to the printer that' b'tells it to load the envelope if it is already loaded, it gets ejected' b'and the printer tries to load another. the instructions in the manual' b'are for dumb dos apps. that don\'t send the "load envelople" message.' b'' b'' b':' b': tom belmonte' b'' b'bob taylor' b'hp vancouver'
