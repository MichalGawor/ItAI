b'' b'' b'there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the' b'fans. i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties' b'more than names honouring personages.' b'' b'i think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in' b'conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional' b'names. although i still do not think the move will draw fans to the' b"game; imo it's a cosmetic change that bettman and the owners _hope_" b"will have an effect. and it doesn't say much for the mentality of" b'anybody it works on, either.' b'' b'another thing that bothers me is the points system. percentages, as used in' b'the other major sports are clearly more informative. when i look at the' b'nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to' b'account for games in hand (which is almost always the case). some will' b'object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an "americanization"' b'of the sport' b'' b'surprise, i agree totally. the points system is fine, if everybody at all' b'times has played the same number of games. since this is almost never the' b"case, winning percentage is the way to go. i don't particularly care if it" b'is an "american" thing either, if it works.' b'' b'' b'--'
