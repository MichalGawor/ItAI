there are times when it is perfectly legitimate to' b'use deadly force, e.g. in self defense. i consider it not just my right,' b'but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and' b'knowing how to use the tools to do that.' b'' b'"the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear' b'arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in' b'government."' b'- t. jefferson.' b'' b'i think what jefferson said is still true.' b'' b'and the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes' b'off into the wrong fleshy target.' b'' b'not very often compared to other use.[3]' b'' b'or else uncle frank gets pissed and blows away his wife.' b'' b"this isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses. it is" b'very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly "get-pissed" and kill' b'someone, gun or not. in most cases, the people who murder have long' b'histories of violence. if you have good reason to believe that these' b"people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it." b'' b'having a thing specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to' b'kill things. right?' b'' b'right, but there are times when killing things is called for. i hope i' b"never have to shoot a person, but i've had to kill a number of animals from" b"rodents to cows, and when i do, i don't want them to suffer any more than" b'is necessary. i prefer they die instantly, but failing that, i want them' b'to drop so i can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,' b"i don't want them to go fast or far. i try to choose the best weapon and" b"ammunition i have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal i'm" b"after, but it doesn't always work as i plan. without belaboring the point," b'people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,' b"particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose." b'' b'' b'[1] accidental deaths in b'48700 deaths by auto' b'11300 deaths by fall' b'5300 deaths by drowning' b'4800 deaths by fire' b'4400 deaths by poison' b'3200 deaths by food' b'1400 deaths by firearm' b'' b'source: statistics department, national safety council.' b'"accidents facts edition". national safety council.' b'444 n. michigan avenue, chicago il b'' b'' b'[2] rkba.002 declining trend of accidental deaths by firearms' b'version (last changed on at b'' b'description' b'===========' b'the accidental deaths by firearm per capita has been declining steadily' b'for almost sixty years. in the accidental deaths by firearm per' b'1,000,000 people was in it was the decline has been' b'steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. at the rate' b'of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around ad.' b'' b'conclusion' b'==========' b'firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over' b'sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.' b'' b'' b'' b'[1] year.' b'[2] population.' b'[3] accidental deaths.' b'[4] accidental deaths per b'' b'' b'[1] b'1932 b'1933 b'1934 b'1935 b'1936 b'1937 b'1938 b'1939 b'1940 b'1941 b'1942 b'1943 b'1944 b'1945 b'1946 b'1947 b'1948 b'1949 b'1950 b'1951 b'1952 b'1953 b'1954 b'1955 b'1956 b'1957 b'1958 b'1959 b'1960 b'' b'sources:' b'u.s. bureau of the census, historical statistics of the united states,' b'colonial times to bicentennial edition, part washington, dc, b'' b'u.s. bureau of the census, statistical abstract of the united states:' b'1982-83.
