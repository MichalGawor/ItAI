b'' b'' b' hey guys!' b' i work on many stations and would like this name and current logname' b" to be in a title of xterm when it's open and a machine name only" b" when it's closed. in other words, i want $host and $logname to appear" b' as a title of opened xterm and $host when xterm is closed.' b' how can i do it?' b'' b"[apologies if i'm answering something already answered in the faq." b"our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately so i haven't" b'seen the faq lately to check.]' b'' b'' b'two ways:' b'' b'1) when you start the xterm, you can use command line options:' b'-n icon_name to set the icon label' b'-t window_title to set the window title' b'-title window_title equivalent to -t window_title' b'' b'2) you can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:' b'' b'the basic escape sequence is:' b'esc <p <some_arbitary_text bel' b'' b'where esc and bel are the ascii escape and bell characters,' b"<p is an ascii decimal digit or depending" b'on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,' b'or both, and <some_arbitary_text is your desired label string.' b'' b'hence, this command will set the window icon title:' b'echo "\\033]0;your_title_goes_here\\007\\c"' b'' b'to set just the icon title:' b'echo "\\033]1;your_title_goes_here\\007\\c"' b'' b'to set just the window title:' b'echo "\\033]2;your_title_goes_here\\007\\c"' b'' b'of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,' b'depending on how the echo command works on your system' b"and what shell you are using (i've shown system-v semantics" b'under bourne or korn shells).' b'' b'[hint for sun os users: use /usr/5bin/echo instead of' b"/bin/echo or csh's built-in echo. otherwise you'll have" b'to embed literal esc and bel characters in the string' b'instead of using convenient octal sequences.]' b'' b'if you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show' b"your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll" b'have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out' b'the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.' b'sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence' b'in the prompt string itself, sometimes not b'' b'' b'+-------------------------------------------------------+------- b'+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\xx/ b'' b'' b'' b''
