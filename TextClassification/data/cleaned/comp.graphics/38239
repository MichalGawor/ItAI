b'' b'up until last week, i have been running povray v1.0 on my under dos5' b'without any major problems. over easter i increased the memory from 4meg to' b'8meg, and found that povray reboots the system every time under dos5. i had' b'a go at running povray in a dos window when running win3.1 on the same system' b'and it now works fine, even if a lot slower. i would like to go back to' b'using povray directly under dos, anyone any ideas???' b'' b'john' b'--' b'john heaton nrs central administrator' b'mcc network unit, the university, oxford road, manchester, m13-9pl' b'phone: fax:
