b'' b'' b' arens) writes:' b'' b' los angeles times, tuesday, april p. a1.' b' b'' b' the problem if transffering us government files about yigal arens' b' and some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal' b' or a local american law seemed to belong to some local american law' b' forum not to this forum.' b' the readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents' b' of those files.' b' so it will be nice if yigal will tell us:' b' why do american authorities consider yigal arens to be dangerous?' b'' b"i'm not aware that the us government considers me dangerous. in any" b'case, that has nothing to do with the current case. the claim against' b'the adl is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that' b'was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their' b'standard interaction with citizens such as myself. by that i refer to' b'things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and' b'license information, photographs, etc.' b'' b' why does the adl have an interest in that person b'' b'you should ask the adl, if you want an authoritative answer. my guess' b'is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in' b'political criticism of israel. i further believe that they did this as' b'agents of the israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.' b'at least some of the information collected by the adl was passed on to' b'israeli officials. in some cases it was used to influence, or attempt' b"to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums. these matters" b'will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since california law' b'entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven. as my' b'previous posting shows, california law entitles people to compensation' b'even in the absence of any specific consequences just for the further' b'dissemination of certain types of private information about them.' b'--' b'yigal arens' b'usc/isi tv made me do it!'
