b'' b'i want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around megabytes sec' b'for very large data transfers.

(so the nubus card and the disk driver can both' b'access data at the same time.)' b'is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use' b'the same bus to mac ram?' b'' b'is there anything i can do?' b'' b'--david' b'+---------------------------------------------------------------------+' b'| david blume "i get tired thinking of all the things i b'+---------------------------------------------------------------------+'
