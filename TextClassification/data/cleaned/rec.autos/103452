b'' b'derek....' b'' b'there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights' b'will come back on after weeks. the tool is in fact illegal (in europe' b'atleast). it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a' b'used bmw and a few weeks later, all the lights come on! other than that, i know' b'of no other tool.... anyone else?' b'' b'about changing oil every miles.... thats ok.... on newer audis, they' b'only require it after every miles (i am talking about an oil change)' b'just a query: do you drive your car very very carefully? like no sudden' b'acceleration etc? if yeah, then the m oil change seems quite reasonable.' b"but if you drive kinda fast... i'd get a bit up tight abot that thingy" b'' b"(a point to note: just because the first light came on at 3k, doesn't mean" b'all the others will come on every 3k too)' b'' b'....shaz....'
