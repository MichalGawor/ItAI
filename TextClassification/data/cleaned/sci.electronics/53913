b'' b'well, my house was built just last year, and the breaker box is wired the' b'same way. all the white and ground wires are on a common bus. except for' b'the 220v circuits, only black wires are hooked to the breakers. it was' b'the same way in the last two houses i had also. are you sure this is wrong?' b"i still have the building inspector's signature on the breaker box." b'' b'the point is that the original poster was talking about connecting' b'ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big no no), and you are talking' b'about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).' b'' b'if this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current' b'flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the' b'house are operating. there should not be any flow in the ground wires' b'unless there is a fault condition. notice also that in the breaker box' b'there is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground,' b'usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.' b'--'
