b'' b'' b'no, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch. indeed, this' b'dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be' b'retractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed' b'to the array-flapping problems.' b'' b'' b'why not design the solar arrays to be detachable. if the shuttle is going' b'to retunr the hst, what bother are some arrays. just fit them with a quick release.' b'' b"i didn't think the bi-stem design was used so much for the retrieval as" b'for the ability to launch in a tight (size) sts envelope. this is my own' b'guess, based on similar designs flown on other large sts-launched s/c' b'(gro, uars). also, there _might_ be some consideration given to mass' b'requirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional s/a). finally,' b"the hst arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember, they're" b'going to be replaced with new arrays.' b'' b"however, as an acs guy who's seen his branch management pull their" b"collective hair out over hst, i would voice a hearty 'yea' to using" b'conventional arrays over bi-stems, whenever possible. no half hertz' b'flexible modes, no thermal snap, no problem.' b''
