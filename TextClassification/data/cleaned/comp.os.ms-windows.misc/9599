b'' b'' b'' b'anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the diamond 1024x768x256 driver?' b"sorry, don't know the version of the driver (no indication in the menus) but it's a recently" b'delivered gateway system. am going to try the latest drivers from diamond bbs but wondered' b'if anyone else had seen this.' b'' b"as a followup, this is a co-worker's machine. he has the latest drivers." b'it only happens using the 1024x768x256 driver. sometimes it takes a minute' b'or so for the cursor to wig out, but it eventually does in this mode. i' b'susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants. i excluded' b'a000-c7ff in the emm386 line and in system.ini the problem persisted.' b"perhaps it is something specific to the gateway machine or it's components." b'it is a 66mhz dx/2 eisa bus with an ultrastore (24xx?) controller. ah well,' b"i was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it" b'before. perhaps a call to gateway is in order, but i do find folks here' b'usually are far more in the know.' b'' b'i have (had) several problems with the card.' b'- applications crashed when moving the mouse (vga mode). fixed by removing' b'the line stacks=0,0 from config.sys. the default value stacks=9,256' b'does just fine.' b'- random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a' b'256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). fixed by turning' b'off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics' b'mode. this also fixed the problem of the windowed dos boxes under windows.' b'with the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the' b'window.' b'- the screensavers do not remove the cursor in color modes (hardware' b"cursor). i don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem." b'clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-' b'for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-' b'unconditionally. do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem?' b'- the vesa driver does not support the 640x480x16m truecolor mode. (universal' b'vesa drivers do not run at all).' b'' b'-----------' b'disclaimer: unless otherwise stated, the above comments are entirely my own.' b'_____________ b'/ b'/____________/ jan van loenen' b'\\________ digital equipment corporation' b'\\ hlde01::loenen_j' b'\\___________/
