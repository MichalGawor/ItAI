b'' b'' b' greetings!' b'' b' does anybody know if it is possible to set vga graphics mode to 640x400' b' instead of 640x480? any info is appreciated!' b'' b"some vesa bios's support this mode (0x100). and *any* vga should be able to" b'support this (640x480 by colors) since it only requires bytes.' b"my 8514/a vesa tsr supports this; it's the only vesa mode by card can support" b'due to 8514/a restrictions. (a wd/paradise)' b'' b'--' b"i am not responsible for anything i do or say i'm just an opinion." b'' b'ahh no. possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your' b'calculator. color modes take a byte per pixel so time is' b'307,200 which is 300k to be exact. 640x400x256 only takes 250k but i' b"don't think it is a bios mode. i wouldn't bet that all vga cards can do" b'that either. if a vga card has 512k i bet it can do both 640x400 and' b'640x480. that by definition is svga, though not very high svga.'
