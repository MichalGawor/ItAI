b'' b'i love it how all of these people are "blaming" the phillies success' b"on a weak division. why don't we look at the record of the teams in" b"each division (read: inter-divisional play), we'll see that the east" b'is really kicking the shit out of the west. i know it is early, but' b'that is all we have to go on. atlanta is just so strong with their' b".188 ba, cincinnati is coming off a sweep at veteran's stadium in" b"philadelphia, and houston was swept in it's first three games by the" b'phillies in the astrodome. that, my western division friends, shows' b'that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you' b'think!!' b'' b"phils all the way in b'braves hit like a aaa club' b'reds need marge' b'' b'-bob'
