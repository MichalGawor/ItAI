b'' b'we have a setup with with polaroid transducers and rangefinders. we' b'would like to fire these three at a time with about ms between' b'firings. the three that are being fired do not fire in the same' b'direction.' b'' b'to further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars a,b,c' b'5 ms apart each other. we should normally see an echo on a that' b'corresponds to the distance. however, sonar a detects the init line' b'of sonar b! the detection is actually through the transducer of sonar a;' b'we can see a very faint 50khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the' b'time the init line of sonar b is activated.' b'' b'we feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.' b'we came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply' b'for sonars b and c.' b'' b'has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and' b'this type of experience? your suggestions for remedies will be greatly' b'appreciated.' b'' b'' b'--' b'ece department ph: b'north carolina state university[] fx: b'raleigh, nc
