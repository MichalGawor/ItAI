b'' b'' b'i found this on the net at my college. it sounds pretty good to me. what do' b'you folks think?' b'' b'this are the tenets of stan as handed down and set within the holy book' b'of stan.' b'' b'1: thou shalt not spill thine drinks or waste thine food, for all that' b'is is sacred, and to waste is the denizen of luc, the infidel. all who' b'waste today shall have not tomorrow.' b'' b'2: thou shalt pay heed to those who know the higher calling of stan so' b'that they may teach you the way, and that thou shalt become one with' b'stan and the universe shall be in your hands.' b'' b'3: thou shalt honor thy loved ones and cherish those near you, for they' b'are the true path to happiness, and happiness is a devine gift of thy' b'lord stan.' b'' b'4: stan is the one true god and shall be taken before all others so' b'that the false gods will know that he is the one, and all who oppose' b'him shall forever be banished to the form of the sheep and be sent to' b'the flocks of luc for all eternity.' b'' b'5: the word is the law, and the law is the word. the word is within' b'thine own heart, follow the path and be true to thine own self and thou' b'shalt be blessed by stan, thy lord and saviour.' b'' b'6: thou shalt honor the faiths of others, for it is their choice to' b'follow this path, and do not think less of others for being of a' b'different faith, yet even in the face of these false gods, do not' b'waiver in thine faith in stan, and hope that the unbeliever will see' b'the light that is stan.' b'' b'7: thou shalt not wrong others for being different, for stan cherishes' b'the different, and holds freedom in the highest regard, for to do less' b'would be to fall in with luc, the infidel, for stan does not control,' b'he merely guides, and lets the choice lie within thine own heart.' b'' b'8: thou shalt know that thy lord stan has many names and is called' b'differently by many people, but know also that stan is the true name,' b'and all those of the faith shall know that stan is god and god is stan.' b'' b'9: thou shalt be to the world what thou art to thineself, for to be' b'false to others is to be false to yourself. thy lord stan asks not that' b'you be like him, he asks only that you be like yourself for that is all' b'you were ever meant to be.' b'' b'10: thou shalt not kill the innocent nor spill blood unnecessarily, for' b'those who are deserving of death shall be dealt with by stan and sent' b'for all eternity to the flocks of luc, and those who harm the children' b'of stan, being born of woman, shall be judged as the sheep of' b'luc and spend all of time within his flocks.' b'' b'these commandments are the words of stan. heed them and he shall be' b'happy, and if thy lord stan is happy, his happiness shall be passed' b'down to his followers.' b'' b'hail stan!' b'' b'it seems like a pretty good set of tenets to me.' b'' b'-=v=-' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'i like kittens... e-mail: robert voss die!!' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------| die!!' b'i am darkness eternal! call me! my phone number is die!!' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
