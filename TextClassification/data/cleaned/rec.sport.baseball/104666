b'' b'i am finding the volume of stuff on rec.sport.baseball' b'overwhelming ca. posts/day. an effect of this is' b'that a backlog builds up, and many posts get dumped from' b"my system. i could probably fix that--but don't have the" b'time to read them all in any event. my guess is that mine' b'is a common problem. i have some ideas that would help:' b'' b'1. each person generally post no more than one article/day.' b'2. limit the extent to which previous posts are reproduced' b'in posts.' b'3. don\'t post mindless `woofs,\' or `anti-woofs,\' e.g. "the' b'jays are best!" or "the jays suck."' b'4. don\'t respond to mindless posts, e.g. "jack morris is' b"a better pitcher than frank viola because he's won a" b'world series." i know that you can use the `n\' key to' b'get by these posts, but they bump interesting posts from' b'my disk.' b'5. use the goddamn shift key etc it makes your posts easier' b'to read' b'--' b'name: jim rising' b'mail: dept. zoology, univ. toronto, toronto, ontario, canada m5s 1a1' b'uucp: uunet!attcan!utzoo!rising'
