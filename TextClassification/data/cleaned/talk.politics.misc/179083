(laughter.)' b'' b'within three years of being hired by a satellite high' b"school, mr. bailey's institution had one of the strongest science" b'programs in the entire state of florida, and it won numerous national' b"and international awards. these advanced programs aren't just for a" b'favored few. tracey bailey has inspired all kinds of students,' b'including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach' b'for excellence and to attain it. this is what our students need and' b'what our country needs.' b'' b'today, we know that a good future with high wages and' b'rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a' b"lifetime. the basics aren't enough anymore. all our kids need" b"competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving. that's" b"why tracey bailey's accomplishments are so important and why i am so" b'pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these' b'accomplishments.' b'' b'tracey, you represent the best in the united states.' b"i'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this" b'apple award as the teacher of the year for (applause.)' b'' b'mr. bailey: thank you, mr. president. it is indeed a' b"great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's" b'2.5 million teachers. and we appreciate the support that you have' b"shown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to" b"help redesign and improve our nation's schools." b'' b"we know that the quality of our children's education" b'will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape' b'in the years to come. and we thank you so much for your continued' b"support and commitment to our children's education. thank you again." b'(applause.)' b'' b'the president: in closing, i would like to also welcome' b'the education leaders in florida who are here, those representing the' b"national education groups who have also come. i'd like to recognize" b"tracey's congressman, representative jim bacchus in the back, himself" b"a great advocate of education. and i'd like to remind all of you" b'that the ultimate purpose of the national teacher of the year award' b'is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to' b'people all across this country who give their lives to our children,' b'all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their' b'best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of' b'america. they are, in so many ways, our most important public' b'servants.' b'' b'thank you very much.
