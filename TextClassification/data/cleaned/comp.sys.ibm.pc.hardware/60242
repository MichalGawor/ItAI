b'' b'date: apr b'basically i\'m looking for a svga (1024x768) non-interlaced' b'monitor. the nec 4fg is the one most of the computer mags use as' b"their standard, and from what i've seen and heard it looks pretty" b"good, but it's a bit expensive bucks is the best deal i've seen)." b'so i thought perhaps i might find something as good for less. any' b'recommendations? i also thought about the nec 3fgx, which has the' b'same specs as the 4fg except for the scan frequency, which is more' b'limited; anybody have any comments on this one? would it work with' b'' b'i believe that nec is replacing the 4fg and 3fgx with 4fge and 3fge' b"models, reportedly being released at the end of this month. i'm" b'waiting for a 4fge, the main difference being a year warranty and' b'higher refresh rates at the higher resolutions. it sounded from a pc' b'magazine note that the 3fge was being boosted in a number of ways.' b'call the nec number and have them send you info.' b'' b'' b'|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ david m. todd b'|department of psychology, university of massachusetts, amherst, ma usa|' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'i have been using a nec 3fgx for several months now. several others here' b'also have this monitor. we have had no problems. personally i would spend' b'extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a pc such as b'mhz viz mhz. based on the comments of others you might want to view the' b'3fgx vs the series on a pc running windows at 1024x768. the refresh rate' b'appears ok for me, but you might feel differently. finally speaking of' b"spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is" b"certainly worth recently i set up a friend's pc 50mhz and vesa" b'local bus. the redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of b'faster which i doubt warrants the extra cost.'
