b'' b'my original post:' b' i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse.com (was using b' i think, but switched to to see if it was any better). vertical motion' b" is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can't click" b' on something because my mouse jumps around. i can be moving the mouse to' b' the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly' b' for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump' b' again (maybe this time to the left about inch!). this is crazy! i have' b' never had so much trouble with a mouse before. anyone have any solutions?' b'' b"aha, i think i found the problem and it isn't dirt! another guy here was" b'using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver (the' b'default vga for windows). he has an s3 localbus card like i do and when i' b'loaded the s3 video driver in windows for him, his mouse became jumpy too.' b'seems like it is the s3 driver! is there any newer one than version b'that would solve this problem? it is really bad. i have to use the' b'keyboard instead sometimes! the s3-w31.zip on cica is version (which is' b'the same version that came with my card).' b'' b'' b'---' b'sean eckton' b'computer support representative' b'college of fine arts and communications' b'' b'd-406 hfac' b'brigham young university' b'provo, ut b'(801)378-3292' b''
