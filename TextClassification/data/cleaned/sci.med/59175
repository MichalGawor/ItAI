b'' b'i had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high' b'school. before that, i used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks,' b"and eyes so itchy i couldn't get to sleep. after about months on the" b"shots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back. i" b'stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college.' b'my allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as' b'bad as they used to be. so yes, the shots do work.'
