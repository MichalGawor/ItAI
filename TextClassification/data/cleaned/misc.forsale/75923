b'' b'hello, i have a motherboard and a case for sale as a package.' b'both of them came from a compuadd computer i bought last august and am' b'presently upgrading.' b'here are the specs--' b'' b'motherboard' b'-----------' b'cyrix 486sl mhz microprocessor' b'chips and technology chipset (scatsx v2.3.6 slslc)' b'8 simm banks for a maximum of megs of ram' b'built-in floppy and hard drive controllers' b'built-in ports--1 parallel, serial and pin)' b'built-in paradise svga controller with meg of ram (windows drivers inc.)' b'-based on the western digital wd90c31 chip' b'math co-processor slot' b'3 16-bit expansion slots and 8-bit expansion slots' b'' b'case' b'----' b'low-profile desktop' b'very nice grey color' b'150 watt power supply' b'room for floppies plus hd' b'' b'mouse' b'-----' b'3-button' b'microsoft-compatible' b'grey color matches case' b'' b'all original manuals and documentation, video drivers, etc. are included.' b'' b'you are probably wondering why i must sell the case with the motherboard.' b'it is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and' b'you would be hard-pressed to fit another mb in it. however, the case and' b'this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly.' b'' b'as you can see, since this board includes drive controllers and a video' b'controller, you can save some money by buying this unit and not a mb' b'where you would need to get io cards, video card, and drive controllers' b'its just a lot more convenient on the whole' b'' b'i would like to ask about for this whole package. i think this is a fair' b'price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/io' b'ports. all you need to do is add drives, a monitor, ram, and a keyboard.' b"also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board, but from compuadd." b'i also will entertain all serious offers.' b'' b'' b'thanks' b'' b'-j'
