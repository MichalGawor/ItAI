b'' b'' b' b' i have a 486sx25 computer with a mg seagate ide drive and a' b'controler' b' built into the motherboard. i want to add a scsi drive (a quantum' b'prodrive' b' 425f mg formatted). i have no documentation at all and i need your' b' help!' b' b' as i understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive. could' b'you' b" please tell me if i'm right.." b' b' buy a scsi contoler. which one? i know adaptec is good, but they' b'are' b' kind of expensive. are there any good boards in the region? i' b'want' b' it to be compatible with os2 and unix if possible. also, i have seen' b'on' b' the net that there are scsi and scsi2 drives. is this true? does the' b' adapter need to be the same as the drive? what type of drive is the' b' quantum?' b'' b'' b' i have tried others, but i think that the adaptec is best value for' b'money.' b'' b'' b' connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power' b'cable.' b' do i have to worry about the power supply? i think i have watts' b'and' b" all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive." b'' b'' b' i dont think you can mix the two types of drive, unless you have one of' b'the' b' scsi/ide cards that is available. you will have to turn your ide off.' b'' b'' b'is this true??? i was under the impression that people on the net had both' b'scsi and ide working together.' b'' b'' b'' b" well that seems to be all. is there anythiing i'm forgetting?" b" any help is *really* appreciated, i'm lost..." b' b' -eric' b' b' b' mark' b'' b'__________________________________________________________________________' b'____'
