b'' b'there is no question that the valentine-1 has good range but' b'not significant enough to be or times as expensive as some of the' b'others.' b'' b'the big win with the v-1 is not its range but rather its' b'directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later' b'called a "gimmick" a conclusion i disagree with). since the' b"detector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's" b'significantly more expensive. while the added capabilities may not' b'help you, there is added value for those of us who live in areas where' b'there are a lot of false-alarms.' b'' b'summary: valentine-1 way too expensive and not a significantly better' b'performer!' b'' b'i certainly call it "interesting" but i\'m another person who thinks' b'that the added value might be coming at too high a cost. very' b'adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and' b'one of them has suited me rather well. if i did more long-distance' b"travelling in areas i'm not familiar with i'd probably consider" b"getting the v-1 because it's additional information would be useful in" b'discriminating false alarms.' b'' b'jim frost'
