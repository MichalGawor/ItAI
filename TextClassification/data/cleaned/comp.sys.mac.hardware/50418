b'' b'i believe apple has a patent on the region features of quickdraw. a mac' b"clone would have to implement regions. this is why apple's comment was" b'that' b'they believe it is not possible to make a mac clone without infringing' b'on their patents. they may have other patents like this.' b'' b'apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably' b'includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially' b'documented by apple). apple cannot patent the concept of a region.' b'' b"i'm guessing that either nutek reverse-engineered apple's internal data" b'structure for regions (i dunno if this would hold up in court), or they' b"came up with their own data structure. if it's the latter, then they" b"won't be able to draw pict files containing regions. besides pict files," b"there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk. (quicktime" b"movies, perhaps?) as long as the region isn't being stored on disk and" b"transferred from a mac to a nutek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't" b'matter if nutek uses a completely different internal data structure.' b'' b'i remember reading that apple also has a patent on their adb hardware,' b'and that the nutek clones would therefore be lacking an adb port. what' b'other patents does apple have on the mac?' b'--' b'mapinfo corp.' b'200 broadway these are my own opinions. any similarity to the' b'troy, ny opinions of mapinfo corporation is purely coincidental.'
