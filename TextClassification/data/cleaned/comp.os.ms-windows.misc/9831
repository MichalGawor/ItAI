b'' b'' b'i am looking for a windows utility that would give me a listing of files' b'in a directory, but also display a description of the file. this utility' b'would allow me to enter and edit file descriptions of, hopefully, any' b'length (maybe a small window with a scroll bar?). i would then be able' b'to browse my directories and be able to see what is in a file without' b'having to open or execute it. any such beast out there? if not, anyone' b'want to write one?' b'' b'joe barrus' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
