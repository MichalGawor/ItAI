b'' b'i was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem i am having with' b'my gateway 486-33dx vl-bus system with ati graphics ultra pro lb.' b'when i have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is' b'fine, but whenever i use it in 800x600 (windows, autocad, gifs) the screen' b'gets about inches shorter. at the very top and very bottom of the screen' b'there is about a bar of black. the screen isn\'t cut off, it just squeezes' b'everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio. while i can' b'manually change the v-size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just' b"shouldn't happen anyway. i've called gateway numerous times and they haven't" b'been able to help me at all. two different times they sent me a new card, and' b"both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer. they even tried" b"to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of" b'days, when they told me over the phone that they would wait more than weeks' b'before billing my card. but their customer support is a different story...' b'so, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what' b"to do. hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so i know i'm" b'not the only one with this problem. thanks in advance.' b'' b'jude m. greer' b'' b'p.s. i already tried going into the mach install program and manually set-' b"ting up the card. doesn't work. whenever i try to increase the vertical size" b'of the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.' b''
