b'' b"i'm not sure were this thread has been before i popped in, but i've never" b'thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or' b"competence. i just can't imagin any valid reason for having a gun that" b"can't wait a few days. i can think of plenty of bad reasons for not" b'wanting a waiting period: i want to buy a gun and kill so-and-so right' b"now, i've crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and i can't" b'afford to spend the night here, etc.' b'' b"i'm not a big fan of guns, but i feel that it is important to guard" b"american's rights to own them. on the other hand, we license and regulate" b'many things without seriously impeding anyones constitutional rights.' b'' b'carl'
