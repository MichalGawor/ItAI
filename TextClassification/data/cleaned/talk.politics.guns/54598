b'' b" you didn't even get the capitalization correct! try reading usca on" b' the constitution, or get any other correct version of the' b' constitution.' b'' b' this is really stupid nitpicking. capitalization rules in the late 18th' b' century were quite different from today, and what was posted matches current' b' capitalization rules.' b'' b"pete zakel is right, we don't need to worry about capitalization" b'rules. after all, the punctuation gives all the necessary information' b'about the sentence structure. why should anyone worry about whether the' b'text is as close to the original as possible. (sarcasm intended).' b'' b' in the original constitution, "militia", "arms", etc. were capitalized simply' b' because they were nouns. this is also done currently in german. there is' b' no special significance to these words simply because they are capitalized.' b' the capitalization denotes no special emphasis.' b'' b"then you didn't understand my grumble... again, i said to get a" b'correct version of the constitution. the first indicator that' b'something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern' b'capitalization rules. the next thing to go is the spelling, and then' b"i've even seen versions where the grammar was modernized (oh, but" b"don't worry, modernizing the grammar won't change the meaning of the" b'text, right?...
