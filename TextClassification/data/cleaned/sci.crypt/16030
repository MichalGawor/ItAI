b'' b": :\ti'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive" b': :internet talk radio could be done. ideally, though, it should be a general' b': :purpose device. it should be a general purpose enough device that nobody' b': :should be able to balk at its widespread use. obviously, to make it easy' b': :for homebrewers, it should use pretty common hardware.' b':' b": why don't we move down even further toward the masses by setting this" b': up on an ibm pc clone(probably needs to be a or a with a' b': sound blaster and a v.32bis modem. those components are very widely' b'' b'i concur for a pc to pc version. but for a interactive thing like' b'internet talk radio?!?! it makes me cringe at the amount of hogging such' b'a thing would do to the bandwidth of the internet. i mean meg files getting' b'floated around for internet talk radio is bad enough. i have a solution; use' b'the phone system; take your electronics and use them on point to point' b'conversations through the phone and thats it. if you need to tell someone' b"something secret and very important wouldn't it make more sense to write it" b'out concisely? and if it\'s just a quick "yo" then use a code word and spend' b'your twenty cents.' b"those good ol analog systems like shortwave, telephones, and tv's have" b"a use don't gunk up a nice digital packet network trying to emulate them!" b'' b'baxter' b'baxter.'
