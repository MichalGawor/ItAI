b'' b'' b'first this man promotes the dissolution of the jews through an' b'intermarriage process, and then says that it will be just a bunch' b"of 'fundamentalist' jews who will object. this clown even called" b"for 'buying' the dissolution of the jewish people." b'' b'does this idiot mean to suggest that any jew who objects to an' b'imibicilic notion like this is fundamentalist? or does he simply' b"mean to insult the orthodox by using the word 'fundamentalist?'" b'' b'i am not orthodox. i am not fundamentalist. i would desire a' b'genuine peace in the region more than this pinhead davidsson can' b'ever understand. but when he shows his willingness to dismiss an' b'entire culture, he proves that the only thing more brain-boggling' b'than his stupidity is his willingness to display his stupidity in' b'this newsgroup.' b'' b'please take your hatred for the essence of judaism and shove it' b'up your ass. remember to pull your head out first.' b''
