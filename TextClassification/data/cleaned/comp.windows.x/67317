b'' b'we recently got an ncd x-terminal to evaluate. this is running xremote over' b'a serial line.' b'i wanted to get some measurement of response time, so i wrote a small xlib' b'program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first expose' b'event to itself. the program times the delay from sending the event, to' b'receiving it. i thought this was the simplest way to test client/x-server' b"round-trip delays. it's a similar concept to the ping(8c) program." b'' b"is this a valid test to perform i've also tried the xbench program, available" b'from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but i' b'just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is "acceptable" interactive' b'response time. has anyone got any ideas on this subject b'' b'thanks.' b'' b'--' b'+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+' b'|andrew fielden. at&t network systems uk tel b'+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+'
