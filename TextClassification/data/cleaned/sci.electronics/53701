b'' b'' b"on an a/d board i've got, i'm using the a/d lines. it measures" b"the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with" b"5v, it reg's 5v. problem is when i've got the input voltage, and i wish" b'to lower it via a resistor. the sensitivity of the board is so great' b'that i can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch' b'the probe and it will register the full input voltage. a 1m resistor' b'only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable.' b'' b'what could the problems be and what else could i use' b"to lower the input voltage? (btw i've got it grounded correctly)" b'' b'' b'_________________________________________________' b'inspiration b'seek the baden de bari b'unknown. b'-------------------------------------------------' b''
