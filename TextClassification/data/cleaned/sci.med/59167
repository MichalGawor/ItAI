b'' b' my girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones. she says that because she' b'has no' b' medical insurance, she cannot get them removed.' b'' b' my question: is there any way she can treat them herself, or at least' b'mitigate' b' their effects? any help is deeply appreciated. (advice, referral to' b'literature,' b' etc...)' b'' b' thank you,' b'' b' dave carvell' b'' b"first, let me offer you my condolences. i've had kidney stones times" b'and i know the pain she is going through. first, it is best that she see' b'a doctor. however, every time i had kidney stones, i saw my doctor and the' b'only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a' b'urinary tract infection. the pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones' b'are extremely painful. my stones were judged passable, so we just waited it' b'out. however the last one took days to pass...not fun. anyway, if she' b"absolutely won't see a doctor, i suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps" b'an over the counter sleeping pill. but, i do highly suggest seeing a doctor.' b'kidney stones are not something to fool around with. she should be x-rayed' b'to make sure there is not a serious problem.' b'' b'steve'
