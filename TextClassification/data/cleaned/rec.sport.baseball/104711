b'' b'' b'npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy (name possibly' b'garbled by me), an official historian for the cia. she has won an emmy' b'for research on moe berg for a tv documentary (which i know from nothing' b'but which sounds good). she said that among other things, berg was the' b"principal spy for the oss (cia's wwii precursor) spying on axis atomic" b'programs, because of his physics background and language skills. she said' b'that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland, and had' b'instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb' b"research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him)." b'(i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb' b"program, but i don't know how reliable this is.) unfortunately, npr didn't" b"mention any kind of a book she's writing i'd certainly buy it." b'dave mb' b'' b'there is a great book out called "they also served" which is about the' b'ballplayers during wwii. there is some info on berg in there. it also has' b'info on pete gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era. because' b'of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the' b'draft for medical reasons. there are some very interesting stories in the' b'book. it is very well written and i would suggest reading it to anyone with an' b'interest in baseball.' b'' b'rob koffler' b'' b'--' b'******************************************************************' b'|dream about tomorrow --don henley b'******************************************************************'
