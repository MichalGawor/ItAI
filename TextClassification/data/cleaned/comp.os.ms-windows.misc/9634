b'' b'' b'' b'' b'date: fri, apr gmt' b'' b'as the subjects says, windows keeps crashing (givinh me gpf) on me of' b'late. it was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every' b'day. the worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie i' b'' b'there is a way in sys.ini to turn off ram parity checking (unfortunately,' b'my good windows references are at home, but any standard win reference' b'will tell you how to do it. if not, email back to me.) that weird memory' b'may be producing phony parity errors. danger is, if you turn checkling off,' b'you run the slight risk of data corruption due to a missed real error.' b'' b"i had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only" b'worked while i was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting' b"windows, however,the problem turned out to be chip simms vs chip simms. i can't use chip simms in my" b'computer, and when i replaced them, the problem vanished, forever.'
