b'' b' \twas the abc coverage of the kings/flames game supposed to be the' b' way it was shown in bc with cbc overriding the abc coverage? when i flipped' b' to abc, it was the same commentators, same commercials even. my question' b' is: was this the real abc coverage or did cbc just "black out" the' b' abc coverage for its own?' b'' b'' b'' b'here in nanaimo (on vancouver island, for you furriners out there) we' b'got the abc coverage on komo. it probably depends on your cable company.' b'' b'i started off switching between the cbc and abc broadcasts, but finally' b"settled on abc. i can't stand don whitman, and al michaels was doing a" b"decent job. he followed the play pretty well, knew all the players'" b'names, and only made a couple of "rookie" mistakes that i noticed.' b'one thing that surprised me is that they never once attempted to explain' b'the offside rule.' b'' b'am-i-paranoid-or-is-this-really-happening department:' b'there were no fights in the game, but there were a couple of occasions' b'where it looked like a fight was about to start. both times abc cut' b'away to show a closeup of a coach or mcnall or something. has abc' b'decided to adopt the "spicer policy?"' b'' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------'
