b'' b'' b' a traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.' b" that's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you" b' want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty. cops are not the' b' only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who' b' witnesses a crime can do so.' b' b' go to the highway patrol and explain the situation, give them a' b' description of the car and the license number, and tell them the' b' specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute' b' (ie, search the vehicle code and have the section number handy). fill' b' out the ticket and sign it. it will go through the same system any' b' ticket a cop writes goes through. if contested, you will have to' b' appear in court to prosecute. your word will not carry the same weight' b" as a cop's." b'' b' and, indeed, the advice i got from a police officer when i had my' b' close call was that, without additional impartial witnesses, it' b" would be my word vs. the other driver's, and that it was up to me" b' to decide whether the time and inconvenience to me was worth the' b' time and inconvenience to the other driver, and also whether any' b' positive effect would result (beyond making me feel better).' b'' b'my worth: i did this once. bdi ladycager in a town car passed me on' b'the right on a two lane road!:-{ i memorized her license plate (this in the' b'days before i carried pen and paper in my tankbag) and went to the local' b'police station. cops filled out the ticket. i signed it. she paid it!' b'' b'' b'"usenet is like a herd of performing elephants with diarrhea massive,' b'difficult to redirect, awe-inspiring, entertaining, and a source of mind-' b'boggling amounts of excrement when you least expect it."' b'--gene spafford,
