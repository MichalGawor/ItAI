b'' b'' b'' b'' b"i have a question about tires for my guzzi. it is a 850-t. the tires that" b'were on it when i just bought it are old and cracked. i do not have an' b'owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the haynes manual are:' b'front, h rear h and pressures recommended are front and' b'33 rear. oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the t-3 is listed at psi' b'instead. anyone know the reason? as i know though, the pressure i should run' b'at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires i purchase.' b'' b'the real question i have is this. the old tires that are on the bike are for' b'the front, a metzler touring special, h and for the rear an avon' b'roadrunner h h as marked on each tire. both are larger' b'than that listed in the haynes manual. what does the owners manual recommend,' b'and was it common to go up one size for this bike? also, this will be my first' b'motorcycle with innertubes. any comments on the various manufacturers inner' b'tube qualities?' b'' b'the above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current' b'rear tire). what is the best metric match? the local bmw dealer thought' b'100/90 h on the front and h on the back. he also happens to be' b'very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.' b'' b'i am thinking of going with a metzler me33 laser (possibly comp k) on the' b'front and me88 on the back, both in mbs variety if possible (the longer' b'lasting belting system). i already use the me33 on both the vision and' b'fj for the front, and like it, and i thought that with the shaft drive' b'behavior and torque from the guzzi that the me88 might give more predictable' b'back end control and sliding behavior than a me55 might, as well as giving' b'much better tire milage life. any comments?' b'' b'a friend told me he thought that my bike had boranni rims which are very' b'good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. i do not wish to' b'mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be' b"careful, any other comments i should make? i havn't looked at the rim to" b'check out the make yet, if it is marked. he just told me late yesterday and' b"i havn't had a chance to check the rim type." b'' b'on another note. i will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)' b'vetter fairing, and i will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually' b"i would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. it could be" b'fork/handlebar mounted. any suggestions? is there such a thing as a frame' b"mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? how about lower" b'bars/clip-ons for it? i would like to restore the bike into a good condition' b'runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly' b"accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'" b'style. (yes i know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is' b'just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)' b'' b'-----------------------------edward walsh----hewlett-packard company-------' b'(208)323-2174 p.o. box boise,idaho b'89fj1200;82xz550rj(vision);75guzzi850-t;dod#98' b'' b'-----------------------------edward walsh----hewlett-packard company-------' b'(208)396-2174 p.o. box boise,idaho b'89fj1200;82xz550rj(vision);75guzzi850-t;dod#98'
