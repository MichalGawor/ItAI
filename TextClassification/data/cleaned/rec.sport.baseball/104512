b'' b'my question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the' b'death of baseball so strongly? i have seen articles of a similar vein in' b'the chicago tribune and in sports editorials on tv.' b'' b'maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are' b'responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom.' b'these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times, losing' b"money, bankruptcies at an alarming rate, and there's going to be an" b'increased degradation of the product they produce. could you imagine' b'ibm, with all their problems, promoting themselves the way major league' b'baseball does? their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not' b'that they are too far from it now what would happen at gm? where' b'would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an' b'inferior product because of alleged labor problems? i think it shows a' b'lack of confidence for the people who run the game.' b'' b'anyway, it just frustrates me when the media says such things, because it' b'inevitably leads to owners trying quick fixes like increasing play-offs to' b'satisfy television or trying interleague play to drum up interest.' b'' b'forget it. word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about' b'a done deal. it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the' b'networks also have to begin soon.' b'--' b'scott barman mets mailing list (feed the following into your shell):' b'| subscribe' b"let's go mets!
