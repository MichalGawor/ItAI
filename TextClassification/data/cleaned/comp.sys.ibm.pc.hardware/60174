b'' b'i recently bought a monichrome vga monitor for that will do' b'1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. however, it is' b'a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles khz horizontal, i' b'think. with my trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and b'- not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to' b'something else, especially if it wants to do text, i suppose. anyway:' b'' b'- is there any way that i can use this as a general-purpose vga' b'display with a 1-meg trident 8900c card?' b'' b'- if not, can i do so with some sort of different vga card?' b'' b'peter desnoyers' b'--'
