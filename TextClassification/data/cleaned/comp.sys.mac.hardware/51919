b'' b'' b'a while ago when i owned a plus and wanted to upgrade its memory, i just ordered' b'the toolkit from macwarehouse for something like it included an anti-static' b'wrist strap, the clamp used to split the clamshell case, and the torx' b"screwdriver. they might not be selling it anymore, but give 'em (and any other" b"company that sells memory upgrades suitable for a plus-style box) a call. i'll" b'bet that they still offer the kit. next day air is usually the shipping method' b'used, too!' b'' b"i'm told that some of these companies often sell a plastic, throw" b'away after one use, version of the torx driver, so ask before you buy...' b'michael' b'--' b'________________________________________________________________' b'\\ michael antolovich in wagga wagga, a great place to be be... b'\\__________________________________________________________/'
