b'' b'i just started reading this thread today, so forgive me if it has already been' b"mentioned. but...what was the deal with renault's putting the horn on the" b'left-hand turn-signal stalk? it was a button on the end, where the washer' b'button would be on the wiper/washer stalk. could the frenchies not figure' b'out the wiring through the steering wheel, or what?' b'' b'ford tried that also, back in my ranger pickup had the horn at' b'the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where' b'god intended it to be. i drove two different cars then (the other an' b'1984 camry), and never did get used to pushing the turn-signal stalk to' b'blow the horn. the only time i got it right was when i was getting the' b'annual state-required safety inspection!' b"not one of ford's better ideas." b'' b'--' b'so many newsgroups, so little time!'
