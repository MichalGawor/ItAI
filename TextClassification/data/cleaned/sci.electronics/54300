b'' b'' b' i have seen the existance of electronics solder with a silver' b'content that seems to have good wetting and fatique reatings.' b' can anyone tell me why it is not used? (silver is not such an expensive' b'metal).' b'' b'from "management of electronics assembly" (ian oakes)' b'after talking about tin lead alloy and the eutectic point...' b'"occasionally, impurities may be added to solder, to vary charactersitics' b'within the soldering process in an attempt to improve performance. for' b'example, addition of small quantities of antimony and copper can reduce' b'the amount solder moves under stress when solid. for particular' b'applications additions of impurities may be warranted but, in general, it' b'is best to keep the solder used in a soldering process as pure as possible."' b'' b"i guess this is the good oil for commercial operations, but it doesn't" b'mention anything esoteric.' b'' b'leon' b''
