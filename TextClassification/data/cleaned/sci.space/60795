b'' b'there has been something bothering me while watching' b"nasa select for a while. well, i should'nt say" b'bothering, maybe wondering would be better. when' b'they are going to launch they say (sorry but i forget' b'exactly who is saying what, otc to plt i think)' b'"clear caution warning memory. verify no unexpected' b'errors. i am wondering what an "expected error" might' b'be. sorry if this is a really dumb question, but' b'' b'' b'in pure speculation, i would guess cautions based on hazardous' b'pre-launch ops would qualify. something like "caution: srbs' b'have just been armed."' b'' b'it does raise an interesting question as to how hard it is to' b'pick out an expected error from an unexpected error in the heat' b'of the moment.'
