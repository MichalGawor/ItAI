b'' b'' b'dear netters' b'i want to send emg-signals from a running person to a computer.' b'each signal is 4khz wide and there is up to of them on each' b'running person. the signal is only to be sent over a few hundred' b'meters. it seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is' b'about 150mhz and about 440mhz.' b'to make the transmitters as light as possible i suppose it will be best' b'the to send the signals in an analog form. as this application is rather' b'specialized i do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-' b'units i need.' b'on the other hand i imagine that i can buy the receiver somewhere. i' b'need a multichannel (up to channels) receiver or complete' b'receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers' b'as needed in the particular case.' b'do anybody know if there is existing such receiver' b'system on the market?' b''
