b'' b'' b'hello all.' b'i am thinking about buying an external monitor for my se/30 and was' b'wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.' b'i am mostly thinking about a color monitor and an bit card that' b'can switch between and something higher (like i read an' b'old report on a card from lapis that could do this, but could not use the' b'external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-' b'back. has this perhaps been fixed? or can any other cards do this (like the' b'micron xceed) b'also which monitor should i buy? at the moment i am leaning towards' b'the sony 1304s or (what exactly is the difference between these?)' b"but are there any other good cheap monitors i should know about? doesn't the" b'monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?' b'' b"please send me e-mail and i'll summarize." b'' b'i would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order' b'companys that sell monitors or cards.' b'' b'thanks in advance' b'' b'eggert thorlacius' b'university of iceland'
