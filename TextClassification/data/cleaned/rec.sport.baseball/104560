b'' b"one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't" b'yet been addressed. i believe the rule also does *not* deal with this' b'situation:' b'' b'if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up' b'and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.' b'' b'however, if the infield fly is *not* caught, at what point can a' b'runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for' b'advancing too early? when the' b'ball hits the ground? when a fielder first touches the ball after it' b'hits the ground?' b'' b'enlightenment would be appreciated.' b'' b'jay'
