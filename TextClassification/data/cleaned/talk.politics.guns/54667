b'' b':what happened in waco is not the fault of the batf. if they would of' b':had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the' b':' b':with the wod and the increased crime in the streets the batf is needed' b':more now then ever. if they blast away a few good fokes then that is' b':' b':with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with' b':mega fire power. they could of gone in there blasting and killed a few' b'' b"i hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:" b'' b'the batf has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in' b'innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property. i will' b'not support the batf until they clean up their act... maybe... as to equipment,' b'the batf has damn near anything it wants... their faults were in intelligence' b'(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during daylight??), methodology (the fbi stated that it is against government policy to assault' b'a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting' b"negotiations first), and legality. the batf's jurisdiction is taxes on firearms" b'and tobacco. they are a branch of the department of the treasury. they have' b'very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the' b'child-abuse charges... the batf has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco' b'issues! and the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with' b'no violence and no validation. this was a clear case of first the batf, then' b'the fbi, having watched too many rambo movies... my opinion is that the agent' b'in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,' b'murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend' b'the constitution of the us. the warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the' b'public what justification the batf thought it had in committing an armed assault' b'on american citizens. and while on the issue of investigating this issue,' b'the randy weaver case and the johnny lawmaster case should be investigated for' b'batf wrongdoing.' b'' b'james' b'' b'btw, if the batf came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet i would return fire to the utmost of my ability.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'********************************************************************************' b'james s. cochrane when in danger, or in doubt, run in this space' b'********************************************************************************'
