b'' b'' b"i've just installed a new colorado jumbo tape backup unit from" b"gateway, and i have a couple of complaints with it. i don't know how" b'common or serious these problems may be. i would appreciate some' b'feedback from others who have used this system. (btw, this is on a' b'4dx2-66v tower system.)' b'' b'i have a similar configuration: colorado 250mb on dx/2 tower.' b'' b'the problems are:' b'' b' o\tfirstly, gateway shipped me only mb tapes, even though the' b'\tdrive is a mb unit. when i called to complain, they only' b'\tsaid: "that\'s all we carry," and "with compression, you can' b'\tfit mb on one tape." maybe so, but then why did i pay' b'\textra for the large capacity tape drive?' b'' b'you got suckered in the same way i did. silly me, believing' b'that the logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity.' b'the people who do this sort of thing for a living call it' b'"marketing." lawyers who prosecute it call it "fraud."' b'perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on' b'their corporate headquarters.' b'' b' o\ti have about mb of data on my c: drive. i choose the' b'\tspace-optimizing compression scheme and started a full backup.' b'\tthe software estimated it would take about minutes. it' b'\ttook hours. does this sound about right?' b'' b'this is a bit long. my system takes about minutes to do' b'the same thing. usually hours, particularly if the tape' b'is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for' b'the write is too small. is there any way to change the block' b"size or write buffer size so it's bigger?" b'' b' o\tduring the backup, about a dozen files came up with "access' b'\tdenied" errors. most of these were in c:\\windows\\system' b'\t(comm.drv, keyboard.drv, shell.dll, etc.), but also' b'\tc:\\windows\\progman.exe and a couple of files in the c:\\tape' b'\tdirectory. anyone else had this happen?' b'' b'this is because the files are opened by dos. the files in the' b'tape directory are likely the executable file or the configuration' b'file for the tape system. i would recommend running the backup' b'from dos so it will make a complete backup of the tape directory.' b'' b"thanks for any and all feedback on this system. i'd also appreciate" b'hearing of good sources for blank tape cartridges, preferably mb' b'size.' b'' b"the 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive" b"won't write 250mb of physical data on the tape." b'' b'thanks.' b'-pd' b'' b'--'
