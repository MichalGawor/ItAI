b'' b' i saw one theist on this net talking about the absurdity of one saying he' b"doesn't believe in god, and how can we be sure. the problem with this and" b'other arguments assumes that the burden of proof lies with the atheist. wrong!' b'in philosophy the one who is making a positive argument must give reasons for' b'his believing so, not the negative. if i were to make the statement elves' b'exist, then it would be up to me to prove my positive assertion, not the' b"person saying that elves don't exist. if the negative in this case had to" b"prove elves don't exist he would have to omniscient and know every inch of the" b'universe. the same applies with god. give me your reasons, and you (the theist) make the case.' b'' b'i think you have are addressing the wrong issue. the situation' b'is more like: we both see some elves. this is established as' b'fact since we can both touch them etc. then one of us says, the' b'elves have always been with us. the other says, no no there was' b'a time before elves were here. which is the positive argument?' b'' b'' b'--' b'/ computer vision group b'/___/_/_/\\/ city university, london ec1v 0hb b'\\___\\_\\_\\/ ext
