b'' b'date: apr gmt' b'' b'could the people discussing recreational drugs such as mj, lsd, mdma, etc.,' b'take their discussions to alt.drugs? their discussions will receive greatest' b'contribution and readership there. the people interested in strictly' b'"smart drugs" (i.e. nootropics) should post to this group. the two groups' b'(alt.drugs alt.psychoactives) have been used interchangably lately.' b'i do think that alt.psychoactives is a deceiving name. alt.psychoactives' b'is supposedly the "smart drug" newsgroup according to newsgroup lists on' b'the usenet. should we establish an alt.nootropics or alt.sdn (smart drugs b'nutrients)? i have noticed some posts in sci.med.nutrition regarding' b'"smart nutrients." we may lower that groups burden as well.' b'' b'i beg to disagree with you on this subject. if i recall correctly,' b'alt.drugs was being flodded by posts like "how do i grow mj" "how do i' b'use a bong?" "wow, man, i just had the coolest trip" etc... there were' b'quite a few people out there who were versed in pharmacology and biology' b'who wanted to discuss centrally active substabces at a higher level' b'without all the other crap filling the bandwidth. i would suggest' b'that you proceed to create a newsgroup dedicated to nootropics if you' b'must have one dedicated to them, and leave alt.psychoactives to the' b'discussion of psychoactives (including nootropics, which are but a small' b'portion of the realm of centrally active substances).' b'' b"i was wondering if a group called 'sci.pharmacology' would be relevent." b'this would be used for a more formal discussion about pharmacological' b'issues (pharmacodynamics, neuropharmacology, etc.)' b'' b"just an informal proposal (i don't know anything about the net.politics" b'for adding a newsgroup, etc.)' b'' b'[more alt.psychoactives stuff deleted]' b'' b'-marc'
