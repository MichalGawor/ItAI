b'' b'i recently bought an amd the motherboard booklet says' b'the board is a wb/h." i have 1x3 simms on board. the machine' b'also uses a super ide i/o card (model pt-604). (of course niether' b'the motherboard or the i/o card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers' b"are) i'm also using a trident 8900c svga card." b'' b"anyway, that's all of the pertinent info i can think of." b'my problem is that the computer often freezes or displays "parity error b'system halted" messages depending on whether i set the memory parity error' b'checking to "disabled" or "enabled" in the setup of the bios (makes sense).' b'its ami bios (so it must be an ami board?).' b'' b'i just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the' b'simms but i keep getting the same error (more frequently now). it all' b"worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till i got home (figures)." b'' b"i've tried to take out all of the simms and even re-inserted them" b'in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.' b'' b'my suspicion jumps to this damn all in one hd controller/serial/' b'parallel/game-port i/o card, or to the motherboard (god forbid).' b'' b'can anyone help?' b'' b'thanks, peace,' b'david geller' b''
