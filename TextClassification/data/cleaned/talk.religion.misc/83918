b'' b'' b'' b"these laws written for the israelites, god's chosen people whom god had" b'expressly set apart from the rest of the world. the israelites were a' b"direct witness to god's existence. to disobey god after knowing that god" b'is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable.' b'remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to' b"god's chosen people. but jesus has changed all of that. we are living in the" b'age of grace. sin is no longer immediately punishable by death. there is' b'repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ. and not just' b'for a few chosen people. salvation is available to everyone, jew and gentile' b'alike.' b'' b'sorry if this is late for the thread, but...' b'' b'i thought god was supposed to be constant and never-changing. how do' b'you reconcile this common christian view with the paragraph above?' b'' b"also, while we're at it:" b'' b'1. how do you reconcile "a kind and loving god!!" with the' b'judeo-christian view that sin was at one time "immediately punishable' b'by death"? was killing people for sinning god\'s way of showing' b'kindness and love?' b'' b'2. is the fact the he no longer does this an admission on his part of' b'having made a mistake?' b'' b'3. now that we are "living in the age of grace", does this mean that' b'for our sins, god now damns us to eternal hell after we die, rather' b'than killing us immediately? if so, is this eternal damnation an' b'example of "a kind and loving god!!"?' b'' b'just curious.' b'' b'--dave wood'
