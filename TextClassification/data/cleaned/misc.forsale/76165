b'' b'fellow netters,' b'' b'i just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out' b"there (even outside of iowa). i'm sorry if anyone thinks that i am wasting" b'space, but i thought you might want some relief from the "so-and-so is a thief"' b"posts. not that i think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be" b'nice to hear some good news once in a while.' b'' b'after seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, i mailed mr. mark miller a' b'request for his copy of wordperfect for dos. he suggested a price of b'in his ad, but when i phoned him, he quoted plus shipping. that sounded' b'more than fair to me, so i told him that i would send him a check the next day.' b'imagine my surprise when i logged into my account the following day and found a' b'message from him saying that it had already been sold (after i had just mailed' b'the money order). after another e-mail message to him, he apologized and' b'assured me that it was a mistake i was the one who he was holding it for. he' b'sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a' b"transfer of license. this wasn't good enough for wordperfect, so i asked him" b'to fill out one of their forms. no problem we thought. it took three times' b'to get it to the right address (my fault). anyway, he mailed me the form for' b'my signature and included a workbook that i had no idea was included in the' b"deal. again, he apologized for not sending it before. i now have the world's" b'best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good' b'ones left. i recoend that if you ever see that mark is selling anything thatat' b'you may want, give him a call. if i had the choice, i would purchase all of my' b'software from him.' b'' b'bravo, mr. miller!' b'' b'- kevin harter'
