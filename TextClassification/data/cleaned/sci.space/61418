b'' b'-| b'-| b'-| announcement:\tthe "hyperknowledge" project for nextstep' b'-|' b'-| i know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, i want to' b"-| answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information. what these" b'-| people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.' b'-|' b'-| it is called labview by national instruments. it is a wonderful object' b'-| it is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language.' b'-| [some lines deleted]' b'' b'i am afraid you are mis-directed. nextstep is an operating system as opposed to' b'a package. i have read a little about it but since steve jobs does not seem to' b'have the marketing capabilities of bill gates my info. is limited. probably why' b'the far inferior windows nt is going to be more widely distributed (but that' b'is another flame-ridden story). some of the innovative features of nextstep are' b'binary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from' b'a sparc to a pc and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package' b'ported to a pc), graphical object-oriented design (its all wsiwig postscript),' b'supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around' b'the mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like unix with x, or dos, or nt or' b'even vms if you feel the need. no package out there comes even close. i hope' b'people will subscribe to the hyperknowledge project and nextstep finally' b'takes off in my lifetime b'--' b'| mail dr ata etemadi, blackett laboratory, b'| space and atmospheric physics group, b'| imperial college of science, technology, and medicine b'| span spva::atae or msslc:atae
