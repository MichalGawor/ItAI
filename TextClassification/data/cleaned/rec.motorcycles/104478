b'' b'' b' after both oil changes, the oil level was at the top mark in the' b"window on the lower right side of the motor, but i've been noticing" b'that the oil level seen in the window gradually decreases over the' b"miles. i'm always checking the window with the bike on level ground" b'and after it has sat idle for awhile, so the oil has a chance to drain' b"back into the pan. the bike isn't leaking oil any place, and i don't" b'see any smoke coming out of the exhaust.' b'' b" my owner's manual says the amount of oil corresponding to the" b'high and low marks in the oil level window is approx. quart. it' b'looks like my bike has been using about quarts/1000 miles. the' b"owner's manual also gives a figure for max. oil consumption of about" b'.08oz/mile or .15l/100km.' b'' b' my question is whether the degree of "oil consumption" i\'m seeing on' b'my bike is normal? have any other k75 owners seen their oil level' b'gradually and consistently go down? should i take the bike in for' b"work? i'm asking local guys also, to get as many data points as i" b'can.' b'' b'' b"it's normal for the bmw k bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand" b"miles. i don't know why. i've had three new k bikes, and all three used a" b'bit of oil when new max maybe quart in first miles; this soon quits' b'and by the time i had miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.' b"i've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner" b'it stops using any oil.' b'' b'' b'dod doh ama, moa, ra, buckey beemers, bk ohio v' b'bmw k1100-lt, r80-gs/pd, r27, triumph tr6' b'columbus, ohio usa'
