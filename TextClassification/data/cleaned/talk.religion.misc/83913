b'' b'...' b"anyway, i don't have anything against amorc, i just wanted to point" b'out that secret organizations are lead by human beings, and we all' b'know what that means.' b'' b'i had an ehum, interesting experience with the rosicrucians, or at' b'least rosicrucians of some sort last sunday. they had advertised that' b'they were holding a lecture titled the graal of the king the room' b'of the heart (which rhymes in swedish). out of curiosity, i went to' b'the lecture.' b'' b'there were four people there apart from the two rosicrucians, one' b'woman and two men apart from me. the rosicrucians were male, both of' b'them. first one of them told us about the rosicrucians and lectorium' b'rosicrucianum, which was founded in harlem, nl in he read' b'straight from a piece of paper, which i at that point was because he' b'lacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy' b'read, too, and he was used to holding speeches, i could tell. the' b'first guy also said that the r:s are a mystical christian order, and' b'that they base their teachings on the teachings of the kathars' b'(english?) from the thirteenth century.' b'' b'the other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a' b"fairy-tale teller's voice. what he said sounded like a load of crap to" b'me. of course that might be because i am unenlightened or something.' b'what made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all' b'contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,' b"then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently," b"but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. maybe i've" b'read too much raw, but it sounded very much like the things he talks' b'about in the chapter _how to robotize people and brainwash your' b'friends_ in _prometheus rising_.' b'' b'it was very interesting to watch the two rosicrucians. the one holding' b'the actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to' b'be a true believer. i got the impression that the top dog had more' b'distance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain' b'power and admiration. he spoke like a fairy-tale teller, whenever he' b'remembered. b'' b'the information brochure is at home. should you want their address,' b'please e-mail me.' b'--ceci' b'' b'--' b'"...men jag tycker {nd} att emacs {r ett hyfsat os." lars willfoer' b'(...still, i think emacs is a fairly good operating system.)' b'==================================================================='
