b'' b'i have an old optonica tuner and integrated amp that i no longer' b'use. the integrated amp section does not work right now but should' b'not cost much to fix. i believe that it is just a chip. i have' b'used it as a preamp and it works great!' b'' b'this is a very nice looking and well built set. they both are low' b'profile but the amp is rather heavy.' b'' b'the tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp.' b'' b'the amp is rated at 75w/ch.' b'' b'these peices went for about new.' b'' b'i would like to get obo for the pair.' b'' b'if anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp, i have had an estimate' b'done that it should cost less than in parts.' b'' b'please email me if you are interested. i will be moving back home for' b'the summer and will sell it back there if i do not do so here.' b'' b'todd' b'' b'--' b'%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%' b'(___________________________________ todd premo' b'/ purdue universtiy' b'/ __\t environmental engineering'
