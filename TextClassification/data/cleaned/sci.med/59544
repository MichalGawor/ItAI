b'' b'hi.' b'' b'my wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year' b'that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness' b'to gaining weight. she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary b'tests and her values were regarded as low. the doctor (and my wife) are' b'not very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" the' b'gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). the last couple of' b'monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given' b'some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the' b"'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language," b"but i haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the" b"brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)" b'' b'my questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?' b'her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the' b"probability of improvement? although the doctor has told her to 'eat" b"normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels" b'that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this' b'affect the treatment, development?' b'' b'i can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and i' b'will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.' b'' b"i don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established" b'medical profession or a praise for alternatives, i am just relaying' b'events as they have happened.' b'' b'sincerely,' b'' b'erik a. wolff'
