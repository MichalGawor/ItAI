b'' b'substituting irony for brains, (bruce klopfenstein) said:' b'' b'' b" of *course* they left rbis off; we're comparing alomar the individual with" b' baerga the individual, so only individual stats count.' b'' b"i forgot. most runs are scored by players stealing home, so rbi don't" b'count for anything.' b'' b"uh, right. you also forgot that you can't get an rbi (barring a hr) with" b'nobody on base. what fraction of all runs come on solo hr?' b'' b'most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the' b'batter did something good. i use the phrase "happened to be" advisedly.' b'lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the' b'most ability to "turn it up a notch" in clutch/rbi/whatever situations, and' b"what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an" b'ability to any measurable extent. there are no clutch hitters. people who' b'tend to do things that *would* cause an rbi if there were somebody on base' b'end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by' b'being in position.' b'' b'my mistake.' b'' b'i agree.' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'member iie, orsa, tims, sabr hands not soft, eye not discerning' b'| and in denver they call you a slugger?' b'"the big catullus" galarraga and compare you to my own mattingly!?'
