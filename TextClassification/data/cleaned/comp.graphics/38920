b'' b"i'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3d key frame" b"positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement. i'm" b"using kochanek-bartels splines (as described in the siggraph b'proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between' b'the key frames. i want the inbetweens to be given in the form' b'(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and' b'z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when' b'positioned at (x,y,z).' b'' b'the method presented by kochanek and bartels only deals with the' b"positions of the inbetween view points to be generated. i've" b'tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the' b'chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are' b'not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the' b'viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although' b"the spatial movement seems to work fine; and i'm quite certain" b"- i think that i've not simply made an implementation" b'error...)' b'' b'now i wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for' b'similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.' b"i'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at" b'anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of' b'the replies if they contact me.' b'' b'--' b'_________ b'\\\\ b'\\\\________\\\\ nth (norwegian institute of technology)' b'' b'"some people play hard to get, i play hard to want" (ford fairlane)'
