b'' b'' b'this might be a silly question but i have to ask it anyway. i am in' b'the process of purchasing an eisa/vl bus dx2-66 computer and i' b'found two places that sell machines that have what i want and have the' b"same price. the first is ares and they use a cache motherboard (that's" b'the brand of the motherboard) with opti chip set, the other is micron' b'(formerly edge technology) and they use the micronics eisa/vlb' b'motherboard.' b'' b'i said that this might be a silly question since i believe that' b'micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while i never' b'heard of cache! i am however leaning towards the ares machine because' b'my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines' b'and they have good tech support hr, days/wk), and a better' b'warrantee years). micron, on the other hand, seems to have' b"recently aquired edge technologies and i'm not sure how much i should" b'trust the company.' b'' b'i would really appreciate any input on this. is the micron machine the' b'clear choice? does anyone know anything positive or negative about' b'either company? has anyone ever heard of cache motherboards? should i' b'go with micron just because it has the micronics motherboard? etc.' b'' b'thanks very much in advance for any information.' b'' b'--' b'mohammad al-ansari'
