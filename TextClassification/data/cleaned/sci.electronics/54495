b'' b'' b'basically, i am looking for something to operate in the' b'ranges of accelerations found in an automobile environment.' b'i would like the device to operate as a trigger for other' b"systems when the car's deceleration reaches a threshold value" b'(which is how i assume some seat belt lock mechanisms and air' b'bag deployment systems work?).' b'' b'open up one of the airbag control boxes. they have inexpensive piezoelectric' b'accelerometers in them. i know that the gm cars use the setra units. the' b'cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing' b'automotive unit.' b'' b"incidentally, these things aren't very linear, but for the application they" b'would do a fine job.' b'--scott'
