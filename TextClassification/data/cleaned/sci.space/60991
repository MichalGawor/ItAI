b'' b'' b'' b'i hear <insert favorite rumor here that it will supposedly coincide' b'with the atlanta olympics.' b'' b'even worse, the city of atlanta has a proposal before it to rent space on this' b'orbiting billboard. considering the caliber of people running this city,' b"there's no telling what we're going to have leering down at us from orbit." b'' b'i would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an' b'object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital' b'velocity. for a target km above the surface of earth,' b'you need a delta-v of km/s. assuming that rockets with specific' b'impulses of seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry' b'weight of kg would require only about kg of fuel+oxidizer.' b'a small dispersal charge embedded in about kg of sand or' b'birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be' b'the payload. i am sure the whole project is well within' b'the capability of the amateur rocketry community.' b'' b"it sounds like a good science fair project--'reduction" b"of light pollution through applied ballistics'." b'or, it could be part of the challenge prize being discussed' b'here: billion for the first person to spend year' b'on the moon, million for the first erradication of' b'an orbital eyesore/ccd burner. i wouldpledge b'for the first person to bring it down, and i am sure' b'there are at least other astronomers, nature lovers,' b'or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.' b'' b'of course, a gerald bull solution might be simpler.' b'(either the solution gerald bull would apply--the use' b'of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied' b'to gerald bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)' b'--'
