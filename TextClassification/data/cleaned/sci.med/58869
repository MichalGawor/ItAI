b'' b'sp to describe here. i have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced' b"sp a seizure on november at 6:45am after eating kellog's frosted" b'sp flakes.' b'' b'sp well, we were going along fine and the other morning, april she had' b"sp a bowl of another kellog's frosted kind of cereal, fruit loops (i am" b'' b'sp when i mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for' b'sp the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea. now' b'sp after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even' b'sp he is scratching his head.' b'' b"there's no data that sugar-coated cereals cause seizures. i haven't" b'even seen anything anecdotal on it. given how common they are eaten' b"- do you know any child or adolescent who *doesn't* eat the stuff? b'i think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now.' b"also, there's nothing weird in those cereals. as far as the brain" b'is concerned (except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as' b'galactosemia), sugar is sugar, regardless if it is coated on cereal,' b'sprinkled onto cereal, or dissolved in soda, coffee or whatever.' b'' b'there was some interest a few years ago in aspartame lowering' b"seizure thresholds, but i don't believe anything ever came of it." b'---' b''
