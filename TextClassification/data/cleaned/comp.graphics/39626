b'' b'' b'' b'hi,' b'' b"i'd like to know if there is any system (cpu hd array framebuffer)" b'which can play and record hdtv quality moving picture in realtime.' b'' b'hdtv has about 6mb/frame, so recording/playing moving picture will need' b"about 180mb/sec bandwidth. i'm thinking to treat the raw data.. not" b'compressed.' b'' b'finding a disk array that can do 180mb/sec. will be difficult. the fastest' b'ones i know about are from maximum strategy (ibm also sells these). they' b'can attach hippi at up to mb/sec. bit). for these kinds of data' b'rates you need more than scsi for connections. their latest model, the' b'raid model gen only does mb/sec. but i think this may be a' b'limitation only of the hippi channel and that customer needs have not' b'exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. they are also not' b'idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a' b'small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. they' b'still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.' b'' b'maximum strategy, inc.' b'801 buckeye court' b'milpitas, ca b'' b'you might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult' b'to keep the hippi bus fully working at all times sustained throughput' b'might come close to maximum burst rate.' b'' b'interesting problem. tell us more if you can?' b'' b'if anyone can advise me what kind of product i should look into, please' b"e-mail me. i will appriciate it. the vendor's e-mail address, price of" b'the products, actual performance data of the products, any info will' b'help me.' b'' b'thanks in advance,' b'' b'kaz sato, tokyo, japan' b'--' b'dick wilmot' b'editor, independent raid report' b'(510) b''
