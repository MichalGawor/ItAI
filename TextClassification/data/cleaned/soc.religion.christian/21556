b'' b'hello, brycen b"i'm a norwegian journalist student and also a christian. thanks for your" b'testimony! but i want to ask you one question: what do you think of heavy' b'metal music after you became a christian? you know there are christian bands' b'like barren cross, whitecross, bloodgood and stryper, that play that kind of' b'music. i like some of it, i feel like it sometimes. of course i listen to' b"the lyrics too. i don't listen to any christian band, but it's better than" b'listening to secular music anyway.' b"hope you're still going strong with christ!!" b'' b'ann kristin froeystad, college of nordland, norway.'
