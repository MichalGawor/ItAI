b'' b'' b'first, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless' b'you include watching the grass grow as baseball.' b'' b"i definitely do. that's why i don't like going to see games played" b'on artificial turf b'' b'the lengthier games' b'are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking' b'longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers' b'and pitching coaches.' b'' b"and while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this" b"is only true when they don't become extra-long." b'' b'well, your idea of "interesting" differs from mine. i think' b'batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special' b'effort to get to the game very early in order to see it. i think the' b'delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are' b"interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control" b'of the flow and timing of the game. of course, the umpires can, and' b'should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand. as ryan robbins' b'has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.' b'' b'one of the more fascinating things about baseball, i think, is its' b'open-endedness with regard to time. you never know if the game is going' b"to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to" b'go on until four in the morning. likewise, some games are action-packed,' b"and some games are slow and lazy. that's fine by me. those folks who" b'want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel-' b'surf and cater to their short attention spans.' b'' b'heather'
