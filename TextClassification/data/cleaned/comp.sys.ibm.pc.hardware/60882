b'' b'serial cables:' b'' b'there are only three output signals: td, dtr, and rts.' b'there are five inputs signals: rd, dsr, dcd, cts, and ri.' b'' b'there are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software.' b'the ibm bios requires asserts dtr and rts and then waits for both dsr and' b'cts before sending. when a bios recieve call is made, it asserts dtr and' b'waits for dsr to become true (times out after a while and returns with an' b'error if dsr never becomes true). it requires cts to be true for sending' b'and recieving. most communications packages bypass this and replace it' b'with their own protocol. the key is that each comm. package could very' b'well have different requirements.' b'' b'my favorite cable works in many cases: short rts to cts at each end, but' b'also run rts through to dcd at the opposite end. td runs through to rd' b"and dtr runs through to dsr from both dte's and of course sg goes through" b'to sg.' b'' b'i have never had trouble with this null modem even though i have used it' b'with a comm. package that was expecting rts to go to cts instead of dcd.' b'the advantage of this cable is that it also works with the ibm bios.' b'' b'gordon lang'
