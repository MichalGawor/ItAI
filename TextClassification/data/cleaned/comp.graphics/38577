b'' b'' b'-------------------------------------' b"+ ............the otis project b'+ "the operative term is stimulate" b'-------------------------------------' b'---this file last updated..4-21-93---' b'' b'' b'what is otis?' b'' b'otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork' b'and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,' b'and distribution. digital immortality.' b'' b'the basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer networks' b'are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them' b'will be around near-forever. the gifs and jpgs of today will be the' b"artifacts of a digital future. perhaps they'll be put in different" b"formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be" b'there...and someone will dig them up.' b'' b"if that doesn't interest you... otis also offers a forum for critique" b'and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes' b'and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang' b'as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors. suddenly, life is' b"breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will" b'travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.' b'' b'spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and' b'let the artists know what you think of their efforts. keep your own' b"copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption..." b"that's what they're here for." b'' b'---------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'where?' b'' b'otis currently (as of has two ftp sites.' b'' b'141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the uwi site' b'' b'sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/otis), the sunsite' b'(you can also gopher to this site for otis as well)' b'' b'merely "anonymous ftp" to either site on internet and change to the' b'appropriate directory. don\'t forget to get busy and use the "bin"' b"command to make sure you're in binary." b'' b'otis has also been spreading to some dial-up bbs systems around north' b'america....the following systems have a substancial supply of' b'otistuff...' b'underground cafe (omaha) lines' b'cyberden (sanfran?) usenet waffle-iron' b'' b'--------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'how do you contribute?' b'' b'what happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely' b'photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either ftp-put' b'it in the contrib/incoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me' b'(email addresses at eof) in email. after the image is received,' b'it will be put into the correct directory. computer originated works' b'are also welcome.' b'' b"otis' directories house two types of image files, gif and jpg." b'gif and jpg files require, oddly enough, a gif or jpg viewer to' b'see. these viewers are available for all types of computers at' b'most large ftp sites around internet. jpg viewers are a bit' b"tougher to find. if you can't find one, but do have a gif viewer," b'you can obtain a jpg-to-gif conversion program which will change' b'jpg files to a standard gif format.' b'' b'otis also accepts animation files.' b'' b'when you submit image files, please send me email at the same time' b'stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be' b'used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people' b"to view. also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll" b'be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works. you' b'can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of' b'emailing).' b'' b'if you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope. merely send' b'copies to:' b'' b'the otis project' b'c/o ed stastny' b'po bx b'omaha, ne b'' b'i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will' b'scan them. include an ample sase if you want your stuff back.' b'also include information on each image, preferably a line' b'description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the' b"directory where it's finally put. if you have preferences as to what" b'the images are to be named, include those as well.' b'' b'conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please' b"contact me and we'll arrange things." b'' b'if you want to submit your works by disk, peachy. merely send a b'disk to the above address (omaha) and a sase if you want your disk back.' b"this is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or ftp," b'but do have access to a scanner. we accept disks in either mac or ibm' b'compatible format. if possible, please submit image files as gif or' b"jpg. if you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather" b'not have to.' b'' b'at senders request, we can also fill disks with as much otis as they' b"can stand. even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send" b'a blank disk and an sase (or for disk, postage and packing) to' b'get a slab-o-otis.' b'' b"as of we're at about megabytes of files, and growing." b'email me for current archive size and directory.' b'' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'distribution?' b'' b'the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely' b'on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is' b'not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to' b'another). in fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local' b'bulletin boards and such. if you could, please transport the' b'appropriate text files along with the images.' b'' b"it would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images" b'from otis to your local bbs. i just want to keep track of them so' b'participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.' b'' b"it's the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as" b'possible. if you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite' b'bbs system....or even just post this "info-file" there. it would be' b'keen of you.' b'' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'use?' b'' b'if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory,' b"you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the" b'stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or' b'full address credit). you will either find this in the ".rm" file for' b'the image or series of images...or in the "artists" directory under the' b"artists name. if permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have" b'to contact the artist to ask for it. if no info is available, email' b'you, or give you their contact information.' b'' b"when you do use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist" b'know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such' b'compensation for their files.' b'' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'naming images?' b'' b'please keep the names of your files in "dos" format. that means, keep' b'the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less. the way' b'i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or' b'four digit "code" for the series of images, plus the series number.' b"thus, leonardo devinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something" b'like:' b'' b'ldmek5.gif or ldmek5.jpg or ldmech5.gif etc' b'' b'keeping the names under characters assures that the filename will' b'remain intact on all systems.' b'' b'' b'----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'creating image files?' b'' b'when creating image files, be sure to at least include your name' b'somewhere on or below the picture. this gives people a reference in' b"case they'd like to contact you. you may also want to include a title," b"address or other information you'd like people to know." b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'hmmm?!' b'' b'that\'s about it for now. more "guidelines" will be added as needed.' b'your input is expected.' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'disclaimer: the otis project has no connection to the church of otis' b"(a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest," b'or ezine administrator. we do take sacrifices and donations' b'however.' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'disclaimer: the otis project is here for the distribution of original' b'image files. the files will go to the public at large.' b"it's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone" b'could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.' b"unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal. otis" b'takes no responsibility for this. in simple terms, all rights' b'revert to the author/artist. to leave an image on otis is to' b'give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed' b"electronically. if you don't want your images distributed" b"all-over, don't upload them. to leave an image on otis is" b'not giving permission to have it used in any publication or' b'broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not' b'limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,' b'screen-printed clothing, etc). you must give specific' b'permission for this sort of usage.' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'remember, the operative term is "stimulate". if you know of people' b"that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm" b'in the booty....offer them free food...whatever...' b'' b'' b'--'
