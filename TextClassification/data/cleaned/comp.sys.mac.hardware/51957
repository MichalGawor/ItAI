b'' b'' b'' b'enter game developers. the sound driver and current sound manager are' b'inconveniently lame for making games.' b'' b"the sound driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. sound manager used by the" b'book is *useless*. disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed' b"is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (it's too slow.)" b'' b'the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager. unfortunately,' b'system supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.' b'' b"the more of the story is to developers: don't cheat!" b'really, i am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what i am about to' b'do,' b"but i'm going say it anyway." b'stop cheating on sound!' b'really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers' b'will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. the grace period' b'is about to end.' b'the sound manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will' b'work' b'even better soon, so use it.' b'' b"well, i want my code to work on old systems too. i don't know about sys b'but at least on there are bugs in the sound manager that causes' b'channels to hang (with no error message). this happends when i keep a' b'channel open for long periods necessary for performance and play many' b'sounds, stopping sounds halfway. callbacks seems not to be reliable.' b'then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to' b'inspect private variables in the channel (qhead, i think it was), and the' b'only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an' b'*undocumented* flag and modify it.' b'' b'am i happy with this? nope. i consider writing to soundbase simply to get' b'rid of the bugs.' b'' b'any better suggestions?
