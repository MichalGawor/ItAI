b'' b'' b'to sum up, when an accelerated board with 4mb vram (true colour 1280x1024)' b'and a fast vga side is available under i will buy one.' b'' b'me too!' b'' b"what's funny is, when we really can buy such a product, it probably won't" b'seem as mouth-watering as it does today. "what? no holograms? get outta' b'here!"' b'' b"i can wait 'cos i've already got an accelerated card. it does 1280x1024 but" b'only colour. you may mock me, but such cards will be here quickly enough.' b'' b'one of the odd things about the computer industry is that, since you can' b'always wait and get something better, some people wait forever. i know' b'people who have deferred updating their original ibm pc for a decade,' b"because every time they look at what's available, they see something better" b"coming down the road. i know people who've dumped their pcs into the" b'garage, but haven\'t replaced them, because they\'re afraid it isn\'t "the' b'right time to buy." they just gave up using computers.' b'' b'i only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff' b"is big enough to warrant changing. for instance, i'll be upgrading my b'to a 486dx-2 eisa, vlb board rsn. the performance difference (under linux)' b"is great enough to be worthwhile. at the same time i'll be buying a new" b"graphic card and new scsi controller. i'll be buying an s3 card 'cos they're" b"fast enough, i have x11 drivers for them and it'll have 2mb vram just like" b'a weitek card. it will also be much cheaper. when affordable 4mb cards' b"arrive, i'll buy one." b'' b'personally, my system at home needs a new disk subsystem, a much' b'larger monitor, a super-fast graphics board by you-know-who, a new' b"cpu board i probably won't keep much more than the case and the" b"mouse. come to think of it, i don't like that mouse very much. so" b"when will i buy? when my dream products hit the market? no way! i'm" b'gonna buy as soon as i have the money!' b'' b'over the last year i\'ve done much the same. but now i need a monitor, more' b"memory (20mb just ain't enough), a gb disk (1.2gb and no space left...). oh" b"well, stay single, don't smoke and you may afford it this year b'' b'--' b'uni koblenz, (..!unido!infko!hodgen) keeper of the scrolls, just' b'rheinau voice: defender of the net, say' b'5400 koblenz. fax: his name is "root". no!!!'
