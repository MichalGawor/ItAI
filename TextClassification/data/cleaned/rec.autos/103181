b'' b'' b'' b'| i find this method much better myself, too, although i do really' b'| hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my' b'| hand both come crashing into my face. after coming to, which is' b'| about minutes later, i change my clothes (because by this time' b'| all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck' b'| down about tylenol to ease the pain. later in the day i then' b'| proceed with refilling the engine oil.' b'|' b"| it's just crazy how i try and change the oil on my cars in one" b'| weekend---i go through about bottles of tylenol and bags of ice.' b'' b"oh, that's not so bad. every time i try to change the oil, i forget to" b'shut off the engine first. the hot oil comes out and scalds me, blinds' b"me, then the engine starts to overheat, and while i'm screaming in agony" b'and trying to crawl out from under the car, i grab the red hot exhaust' b'pipe and get third degree burns on my hands. my screams intensify as i' b'finally emerge from under the car, and i struggle to my feet in front of' b'the car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super' b'heated coolant. then the engine seizes, but not before the cylinder head' b'explodes, piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron.' b'' b"this happens every time. i'm starting to think i should pay the mechanic" b'$25 instead paying the hospital and the dealer for a new' b'car. this gets costly when you change the oil every miles.' b'' b'- toadface'
