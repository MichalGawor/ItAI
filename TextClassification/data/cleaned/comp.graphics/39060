b'' b'does anyone know where i can find a code which would take concave' b'polygons and break them up into a set of convex polygons?' b'' b'i also would like code or algorithms to do this.' b'' b'although i am not offering code, i would like to point out that' b'any polygon triangulation code satisfies the task as stated. if you' b'want code to partition a polygon into the *minimum* number of convex' b'pieces, i doubt very much if it exists, although an algorithm is known.'
