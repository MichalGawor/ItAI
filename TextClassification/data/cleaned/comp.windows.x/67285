b'' b'is there anyway to use x windows over an async line? clearly you could use' b' x' b'it is x window.' b'' b'no, it isn\'t. it is the "x window system", or "x11", or "x" or any of' b'a number of other designations accepted by the x consortium. in fact,' b'doing "man x" on pretty much any x11 machine will tell you:' b'' b'the x consortium requests that the following names be used' b'when referring to this software:' b'' b'x' b'x window system' b'x version b'x window system, version b'x11' b'' b'there is no such thing as "x windows" or "x window", despite the repeated' b'misuse of the forms by the trade rags. this probably tells you something' b"about how much to trust the trade rags if they can't even get the name" b'of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have' b'to say?' b'' b'with regard to dialup x11 implementations, there are several. you can' b'buy serial x11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both' b"graphon and ncd. (in fact, i'm composing this from an ncd running x11" b'over serial lines across kbaud connection.)' b'' b'ncd also sells a software-only package that provides xremote (which is' b"ncd's implementation of serial x11) for pc's. there may be other such" b'software packages available.' b'' b'x11r6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running' b"x11 over low-speed connections. it's called low bandwidth x (lbx), and" b"is based on improved versions of the techniques used in ncd's xremote." b'' b'it seems likely that once lbx is released as a consortium standard, there' b'will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various' b'sorts of hardware.' b'' b'followups directed to comp.windows.x' b'--' b'matt landau\t\t\twaiting for a flash of enlightenment'
