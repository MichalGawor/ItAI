(i was listening' b' on the radio). this was the game that quayle told the brewers players that' b' he would like to see them play the orioles in the alcs.' b'' b"it's come to this, has it? defending al gore by comparing him to dan quayle?" b"i'd say that about says it all... back to the pit with ye, back to alt.fan." b'dan-quayle! begone!' b'' b'------ b'' b'' b"* they're not just opinions they're caffeine for the brain! b'** (up to milligrams per cynical observation.) b'recommended minimum daily requirement: mg. keep reading.'
