b'' b'last year, i was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an' b"inguinal hernia. i couldn't remember doing anything that would have" b"caused it. that is, i hadn't been lifting more than other people do," b'and in fact probably somewhat less. eventually the thing became more' b'painful and i had the repair operation.' b'' b'this year i developed a pain on the other side. this turned out to be' b'another inguinal hernia. so i go back to the hospital monday for' b'another fun operation.' b'' b"i don't know of anything i'm doing to cause this to happen. i'm b"years old and i don't think i'm old enough for things to start falling" b'apart like this. the surgeon who is doing the operation seems to' b'suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear' b'when i was and not really as active as i was when i was younger?' b'' b'does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting' b"anything? it's rare that i lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack" b'full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery' b'sack is fairly small these days. is there some sort of exercise that' b'will reduce the risk?' b'' b"of course, my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at" b'the computer, reading news...' b'--' b'nasa/msfc flight data systems branch'
