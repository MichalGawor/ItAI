b'' b'i hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net' b"before, but i'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my" b'feeling that "the assumption of mary" would be better phrased "our' b'assumptions _about_ mary." in all the time i\'ve been reading about' b'mary on this group, i can not recall reading much about mary that' b'did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, scriptural' b'foundation.' b'' b"i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ's parents" b'as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their' b"humility and submission to god's working, beyond doubt. but the almalga-" b'mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me' b'an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human' b'desire. only christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even he knew' b'temptation, albeit without submitting to it.' b'' b"i also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the holy parents were some-" b'how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability' b"to grasp the immensity of god's grace in being incarnated through an or-" b'dinary human being.' b'' b'i won\'t start yelling about how people are "worshipping" mary, etc.,' b'since folks have told me otherwise about that, but i do think we' b"lose part of the wonder of god's incarnation in christ when we make" b'his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.' b'' b'--' b'paul marxhausen b'.. university of nebraska lincoln b'. grace b'. happens
