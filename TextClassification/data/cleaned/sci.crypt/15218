b'' b'| i somehow started to doubt technical competence of the' b'| people who designed the system. why on the earth split the' b'| 80-bit key in 40-bit parts to keep them in escrow separately' b'| (having bit and large volumes of data voice links produce' b'| it should be relatively easy to break it) when they simply' b'| could keep 80-bit sequences in n (n=2) independent places' b'| and then xor all the partial keys to get the actual key (n-1' b'| sequences should obviously be selected randomly and nth is the' b'| actual key xor-ed with the random sequences).' b'' b"without real technical details, it's hard to answer this question. but" b'suppose they already *are* xoring the two 40-bit parts to produce only' b"40 bits of real key material? maybe they're using the exportable version" b'of rc2...? b'' b'phil'
