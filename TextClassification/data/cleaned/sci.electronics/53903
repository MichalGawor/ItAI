b'' b'' b'hello--' b'' b'i just bought a new portable cd player for the office, and i notice that' b'it proudly proclaims times oversampling" on the box. now while i think' b'i understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete "samples"' b'exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),' b'i don\'t understand this times" business... it seems to me that when' b'i bought my first cd player (was it really years ago?!), the specs' b'said times" could someone please tell me whether i\'m getting' b"senile? if i'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take" b"samples at a higher rate? if i really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't" b'i have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording' b'process? furthermore, am i wrong in interpreting the sampling rate' b"(from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data" b'rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium? does this mean' b'that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has' b'changed since b'' b"i'm so confused..." b'' b'--cliff' b'' b'--' b"| i'm pretty sure the world *isn't* fair... if it b"| were, i'd be a lot worse off! n5tju
