b'' b'' b"if anything, the bsa has taught me, i don't know, tolerance or something." b"before i met this guy, i thought all gays were 'faries'. so, the bsa has" b'taught me to be an antibigot.' b'' b'i could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout' b"back in the 1960s. the issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the" b'same. thanks for a well put testimonial. stan krieger and his kind who' b"think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the" b'only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. the bsa has' b'been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have' b'survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts' b"haven't given up. seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that" b'scouting is still worth fighting for.' b'' b'on a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this' b'camp leader was in the bsa you may be putting him at risk by publicizing' b'it. word could leak out to the bsa gestapo.' b'' b'bill mayne'
