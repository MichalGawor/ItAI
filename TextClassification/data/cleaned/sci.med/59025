b'' b'' b'i believe it is illegal for a residency to discriminate against' b'fmgs.' b'' b"is that true? i know some that won't even interview fmgs." b'' b'i think a case could be made that this is discriminatory,' b'particularly' b"if an applicant had good board scores and recommendations but wasn't" b"offered an interview, but i don't know if it has ever gone to court." b'' b'fmgs who are not citizens are, like all aliens, in a difficult' b'situation. only citizens get to vote here, so non-citizens are of' b'little or no interest to legislators. also, the non-citizen may well' b'be in the middle of processing for resident alien status. there is a' b'stron sense that rocking the boat (eg. suing a residency program)' b'will delay the granting of that status, perhaps for ever.' b'' b'don mackie his opinions'
