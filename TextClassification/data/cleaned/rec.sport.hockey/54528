b'' b'the thing that confuses me most about espn is that they decided to show the' b'penguins and devils again on thursday night. being that both of the first' b'two games were dominated by pitt., you would think that they would show a' b'different game. this is in addition to the fact that they should show other' b'games just for the sake of fair exposure.' b'' b'nesn owns the rights to bruin telecasts. i suspect that nesn was only' b'going to sell one telecast to espn (remember, espn only owns exclusive' b'rights to the finals, not the entire playoffs). since espn bought the' b'sca contract, there are less wrangles to untie with showing the devils' b'and penguins.' b'' b'' b'also, some of you should know that (as far as i can tell) espn is not going' b'to show campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds. i' b'believe that they are only going to show campbell games in the first two' b'rounds as those series wear on (games or perhaps games b'' b'' b'i think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it. plus they' b'have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule' b'unless the nhl was willing to make a western club move up their game.' b'i think the nhl got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for abc.' b'' b'also, does anyone have info on abc coverage for this sunday b'' b'' b'' b'same exact coverage as last week: pit-nj game in the east, chi-stl' b'in the central, la-cgy in the mountains and west.' b'' b'' b'robert andolina' b'' b'' b'' b''
