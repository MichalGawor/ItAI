b'' b'advice on saturn extended warranty' b'-----------------------------------' b'' b' i placed an order for a saturn sl2 and it is expected next week. the' b'saturn retailer gave me some pamphlets about the extended warranty plan' b'and i have been thinking about it. being a first time new car buyer, i am' b'seeking advice from veterans esp. those who have bought saturns lately.' b'fyi, i have listed some of the features of the saturn extended warranty plan.' b'the car comes with a years/36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty.' b'' b'plan i' b'-------' b'extended powertrain coverage' b'' b'covers the cost of repairs to' b' engine' b' transaxle' b' front wheel drive' b'* hour roadside assistance program' b'' b'coverage term (years/miles)' b'' b'deductible b'---------- b'$50 b'' b'' b'i say extended warranties are a ripoff, high-profit item for dealers.' b'but what i really want to point out here is that you are not buying' b'5/60k, 6/75k, 6/100k. you get 3yr/36k *free*. so what you are buying is' b'2/24k, 3/39k, 3/64k. keep that in mind when you look at the cost vs. coverage.' b'another point is that many car companies routinely fix car problems that are' b'out of warranty...why? design/manufacturing defects that the company owns up' b'to, keeping customer happy, etc.'
