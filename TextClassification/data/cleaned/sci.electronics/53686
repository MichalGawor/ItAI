b'' b"ok, what's a quick rundown on all the series variations? we're" b'repairing something with a 74act00 on it and the question arises, "well,' b'do i really need the act part?" flipping through digi-key i see' b'als, as, c, hc, ac, acq, act, hct, acht, hctls...' b'' b"here's something i posted about this a few years ago. it's not fully" b'up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different' b"manufacturer's synonyms):" b'' b'------' b'in practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view' b'of the families (nb i am not a giant corporation, which influences my' b'views on things like availability and backward compatibility):' b'' b'74\tthe original. speed good, power consumption fair. effectively' b'obsolete now; use 74ls or later, except for a *very* few oddball' b'functions like which are hard to find in newer families.' b'' b'74h\tmodification of for higher speed, at the cost of higher' b'power consumption. very obsolete; use 74f.' b'' b'74l\tmodification of for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.' b'very obsolete; use cmos.' b'' b'74s\tlater modification of for even higher speed, at some cost in' b'power consumption. effectively obsolete; use 74f.' b'' b'74ls\tcombination of 74l and 74s, for speed comparable to with lower' b'power consumption. best all-round ttl now, widest variety of' b'devices.' b'' b'74f\tfast as blazes, power not too bad. the clear choice for high' b'speed in ttl. availability and prices generally good.' b'' b'74as\tfailed competitor to 74f, although a few 74as parts do things' b'that are hard to find in 74f and thus are still useful.' b'' b'74als\tpossible replacement for 74ls. generally souped up. still fairly' b'new, availability and prices possibly a problem.' b'' b'74c\tfairly old family, cmos devices with ttl pinouts. competed with' b'4000 series, not too successfully. obsolete; use or newer' b'cmos families.' b'' b'4000\t(thrown in as the major non-74 non-ecl logic family.) the old cmos' b'family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low' b'power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages. not fast.' b'very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,' b'but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).' b'there are neat devices in this family that exist in no other. the' b'clear choice when speed is not important.' b'' b'74hc\ta new attempt at 74-pinout cmos. fast compared to old cmos, power' b'consumption often lower than ttl. possibly a good choice for' b'general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.' b'cmos logic levels, *not* ttl ones. beware very limited range of' b'supply voltages compared to older cmos, also major rise of power' b'consumption at faster speeds.' b'' b'74hct\t74hc with ttl logic levels. much the same comments as 74hc. read' b'the fine print on things like power consumption ttl compatibility' b'in cmos involves some compromises.' b'' b'10k\t(thrown in for speed freaks.) the low end of ecl. various sources' b'claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast ttl for' b'serious high-speed work. less forgiving, though: read and follow' b"the rules or it won't work. availability to hobbyists limited," b'can be expensive.' b'' b'100k\t(for real speed freaks.) hot ecl. harder to handle than 10k, and' b'inconvenient packages. much more useful datasheets, however.' b'' b'as for compatibility between families: the families (except 74c and' b'74hc) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74x devices' b'you can drive from one 74y output varies enormously with x and y. you just' b'have to read the specs and do the arithmetic. 74c and 74hc are compatible' b'with the others with a bit of hassle. compatibility can be a bit of' b'hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage is using.' b'10k or 100k to anything else is considerable hassle.' b'' b'me? i use and 74ls with a sprinkling of 74f. 74hc[t] and 10k are' b"interesting but i haven't used either significantly yet." b'--'
