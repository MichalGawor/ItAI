b'' b'' b'beware. there is only one such *copyrighted* image and the company' b'that generated is known to protect that copyright. that image took' b'hundreds of man-hours to build from the source satellite images,' b'so it is unlikely that competing images will appear soon.' b'' b'so they should sue the newspaper i got it from for printing it.' b"the article didn't say anything about copyrights." b'' b'(1) no explicit (c) is necessary. if it the image is attributed to the' b'geosphere company, then there is a likelihood permission is has been' b'given to reprint.' b'' b'(2) unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals.' b'however, "interesting" images do make their way into ads and' b'computer demos. that is when a pirate might get some flak.' b'this image is considered so "interesting" that many people would' b'like to use it whenever some global map is needed, so there' b'is lots of temptation.' b'' b'(3) one mail person said since the source data- satellite imagery-' b"is not copyrighted, then the derived image can't be. not true." b'a new, distinctive, creative expression of the data can be protected.' b'this image is certainly fits such, since no one else has taken the' b'tremendous effort to re-create it themselves. precedent is a recent' b'telephone book court case. ma bell tried to copyright the data in' b'their books and prevent competitors from copying it (there are' b'trick entries in the book). but the court only permitted copyright' b'of the expression of the data, and not the data themselves.
