b'' b' b' basically, the mac pluses are constantly rebooting themselves, as if the' b' reboot button were being pushed. sometimes the mac is able to fully boot' b' and display the desktop, but it is only a matter of time before it reboots' b' again. at times, the frequency is as high as several times a minute.' b' b' i wonder if your mac has those little "reset interupt" switches' b' installed. they are plastic devices that push on the switches which' b' are inside the mac. or mabey those switches are bad and need replacing.' b'' b'i wish i caught the original post, but anyway b'' b'' b"the problem is that the plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as" b'the analog sweep board) is on its way out. apart from a board swap (bikkies to' b"apple), there's not much the average joe can do to fix it." b'' b'you can, of course, try and re-adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should' b'be as close to 5v as you cn get it) but this is more often than not a' b'temporary fix. a copy of larry pina\'s "macntosh repair upgrade secrets" is a' b'worthwhile investment for the serious do-it-yaself-er.' b'' b''
