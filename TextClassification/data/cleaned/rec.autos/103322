b'' b'folks,' b'' b'i am going to be purchasing a new vehicle in the next few months. i' b'am trying to hold out until the fall since i have heard that i can' b"be in a better negotiating position to purchase a right when the" b"'94s are coming out. i need something that can comfortably carry" b'2 adults, kids in car seats, and 60-pound dogs. i can probably' b"afford something in the 14k-16k range. i am interested in the suv's" b'but am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford.' b'i think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but' b'is above my range. the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range' b'but i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down. can anyone' b'offer any suggestions? i am hoping for something a little more hip' b'than the traditional wagon, and the suvs look like fun (we do a lot of' b'camping too).' b'' b'veek' b''
