b'' b'' b' i realize i am very ignorant about much of the bible and' b' quite possibly about what christians should hold as true. this i am trying' b' to rectify (by reading the bible of course), but it would be helpful' b' to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the bible or other' b' relevant aspects of the christian faith. one of my questions i would' b' like to ask is can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological' b' works intended for a lay person?' b'' b"i won't even recommend books from my congregation. what you ask sounds" b"attractive but it is dangerous. as a new christian you don't want to be" b"contaminated with other people's interpretation. steep your self in" b'scripture, and discuss with other christians. read if your must but' b'remember that what other people write is their interpretation. god has' b'promised to give you light, so ask for it.' b'' b' i have another question i would like to ask. i am not yet affiliated' b' with any one congregation. aside from matters of taste, what criteria' b" should one use in choosing a church? i don't really know the difference" b' between the various protestant denominations.' b'' b'' b"don't wait too long before attaching yourself to church. just remember to" b'always compare what they teach you with scripture like the bereans did.' b'' b'darius'
