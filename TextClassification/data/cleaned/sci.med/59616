b'' b':being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic' b':persistent anything. persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,' b':biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic' b':persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular' b':carcinoma.' b':' b':most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (cph) are probably the result of' b':a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be' b':determined. the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy. it' b':consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting' b':plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. but in contrast' b':to chronic active hepatitis (cah) there is no periportal inflammation,' b':bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.' b':' b':cph has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. if i had to choose between cah and' b':cph there is no question i would also choose cph. however, as david pointed' b':out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have' b':it. the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing' b':areas compatible with both cph and cah. maybe it is a sampling problem. maybe' b":it is a continuum. i don't know." b'' b'darn. just when i think i understand something someone who knows the' b"pathology has to burst my bubble we'd better not start talking about" b"glomerular diseases, then i'll really get depressed." b'' b'seriously though, i wonder how someone with cph would end up getting a' b'biopsy in the first place? my understanding (and feel free to correct me)' b'is that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated, with overall normal' b'hepatic function. i would think that the only clue might be a history of' b'prior hepb infection and a positive hepb-sag. or is it indeed on a' b'continuum with cah, and the distinction merely one of pathology and' b'prognosis, but otherwise identical clinical features?' b'' b'--' b'=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=' b'= kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh b'= general internal medicine "...dammit, not a programmer!" b'=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-='
