b'' b'someone writing anonymously asks:' b'' b' would you have become a christian if you had not' b' been indoctrinated by your parents? you probably never learned about' b' any other religion to make a comparative study. and therefore i claim' b' you are brain washed.' b'' b'i *did* become a christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents, and' b'having studied buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser' b'degree. i made a decision to accept the truth-claims of christianity after' b'having given it a lot of thought. (i have to point out that the process was not' b'purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well.' b"also, my calvinist should rest assured that i don't lay any of the" b'responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but god.)' b'' b'it took me years and years for this all to happen, because i had many of the' b'objections that this poster puts forward. i grew up in the shadow of [generic' b"authoritarian conservative denomination], and i *knew* that that wasn't a way" b'of life that i could adopt. but i gradually learned not to tar all of' b'christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter' b'night that i accepted what i had heretofore rejected. i am quite certain that' b'i was not "brain-washed".' b'' b'bill hovingh'
