b'' b' hi!!' b' i have a question:' b' which is the diference between performa and lciii?' b' i want to know which is better.' b' if you know the specifications and the prices of this computers, can' b" i'd like to know the diference between the apple monitor('14) and the" b' performa monitor too.' b'' b' \tperforma classic ii' b' \tperforma lc ii' b' \tperforma 4xx lc iii' b' \tperforma well, nothing b'' b' \tthe performas are made to be low-cost business solutions. the 4xx have' b' bundled software, modems, etc.' b' \tbecause they have no "retail price" you might be able to get a steeper' b' discount on them. shop around.' b'' b' \tas far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party. much cheaper.' b'' b' brett' b' b' \t"there\'s nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an' b' intellectual conviction." sean o\'casey in _the white plague_ by frank herbert.' b'' b"hmmm... that's not quite right. the performa is real darn close" b"to the iivx (but a better buy imo). i also don't think they are so" b"much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution." b'why else bundle at ease (among other things)? hardly a business' b'application.' b'' b'what do you mean by \'no "retail price"\'. quite the contrary, i think.' b'the price is darn near the same all across the country. that (again,' b'imo) was one of the selling points of the performas ie: no haggling' b'required. kinda like the saturn (car) of the computer set. one' b'price, medium performance, ready to go.' b'' b'when i shopped for my performa (600cd), the difference between sears' b'(*sigh), montgomery wards, silo (*sigh), circuit city (*sigh*) and' b"bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been why i chose one over the" b'other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who' b'went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who' b'sells apples?). admittedly, except for montgomery wards (and i' b"suspect i was just lucky) all of the salesfolk i spoke to didn't know" b'didly about the computers, peecee or mac. but then, neither did any' b'of the apple dealers i spoke with...' b'' b"if you would've told me a year ago that i would buy a macintosh from" b'montgomery wards i woulda laughed for a long, long time. go figure.' b"i'm *real* happy with my performa. oh, and i bought the apple" b'performa plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party). happy with that' b'decision as well. i walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out' b"with a spankin' new computer the day before christmas." b'--' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------' b'instrument approach procedures automation dot/faa/ami-230' b'---------------------------------------------------------------------'
