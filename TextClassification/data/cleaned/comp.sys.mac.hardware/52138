b'' b'' b'i just put a 33mhz cpu into my centris now i have a math' b'coprocessor, but is it possible to speed up the centris to run at either' b'25mhz or 33mhz??' b'' b'not without replacing most of the chips on the motherboard. the c610' b"isn't like the iisi was, meaning that the motherboard of the c610 is" b'actually designeds to run at the speed of the cpu, and not designed to' b'run at a higher speed (like 25mhz) but be forced to run at the speed of' b'a slower cpu (20mhz).' b'' b"i didn't see any oscillators on the motherboard like the ones on the iisi's" b'motherboard! where is the oscillator for the centris?' b'' b'there is more than one oscillator. if you are talking about the cpu' b'oscillator chip, i think that it is located under the socket for the' b"'040. at least this is what i have read in some other posts in this" b'group.' b'' b'-hades'
