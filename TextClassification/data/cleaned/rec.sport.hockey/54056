b'' b' i was watching the detroit-minnesota game last night and thought i saw an' b' octopus on the ice after ysebaert scored to tie the game at two. what gives?' b'' b" no no no!!! it's a squid! keep the tradition alive! (kinda like the" b' fish at unh games....)' b'' b'actually, the way i understand it, it is an octapus.' b'apparently, a number of years ago, a fan threw an octapus on' b'the ice and the announcer said "octapi will not occupy the ice"' b"or something like that, and it's happened ever since. the fans" b'cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands, and' b'boo those who use a shovel.' b'' b'matt at uva'
