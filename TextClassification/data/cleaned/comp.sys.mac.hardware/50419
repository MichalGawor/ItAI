b'' b'' b'my wife has one of these. i have not had much chance to fiddle with' b'it, but in comparison to our laserwriters with canon engines, she' b'complains that the print is too light for her taste. the difference' b'is quite apparent even when the print setting on the select is' b"adjusted to the darkest possible level. i don't find it" b'objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some' b"people don't care for it and it is considerably different." b'' b'i recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black' b'vs. write-white engines when dealing with tex drivers. is something' b'like that going on here?'
