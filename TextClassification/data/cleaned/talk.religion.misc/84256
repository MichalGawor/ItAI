b'' b'' b'' b' i recall reading in michael rutherford\'s novel "sarum" a scene in' b' which the son of a roman nobleman living in britain takes part in a' b' secret ceremony involving a bull. he stands naked in a pit covered' b' with some sort of scaffolding while assistants coax a bull to stand on' b' the scaffolding. they then fatally stab the bull, which douses the' b' worshipper in the pit with blood. this is supposedly some sort of' b' rite of passage for members of the bull cult. i wonder if this is' b' related to the mithras cult?' b' b" i don't know where rutherford got his information for this chapter." b' the book is historical fiction, and most of the general events which' b' take place are largely based on historical accounts.' b'' b" there is a rite like this described in joseph campbell's" b' _occidental_mythology_. he also described levels of initiation, i think' b" i don't know where campbell got his info, but i remember thinking he" b' was being a little eclectic.' b'' b' i also wonder what if any connection there is between the ancient bull' b' cults and the current practice of bullfighting popular in some' b' mediterranean cultures.' b'' b" quite a bit. if you haven't read campbell, give him a try." b'' b' b' oregon health sciences university. b'' b'' b'yes. i cannot remeber which works i read about this in, as it was many' b'years ago. this ritual was called the tarobaullum i believe, (the' b'spelling may be off).' b'' b'pope charles' b'' b'------------------' b"origin: the brewers' witch bbs houston, tx
