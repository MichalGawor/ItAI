b'' b'i just had my chrysler painted. i was told to refrain from waxing it and' b"to leave it out in the sun!! supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from" b'the paint over a month or so (i can smell it feet away on a hot day) and' b'lets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out, as the paint remains' b'a little soft for a while.'
