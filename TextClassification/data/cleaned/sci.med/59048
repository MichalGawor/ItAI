b'' b'does the bates method work? i first heard about it in this newsgroup' b'several years ago, and i have just got hold of a book, "how to improve your' b'sight simple daily drills in relaxation", by margaret d. corbett,' b"('authorized instructor of the bates method), published in it" b'talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise. has there been' b'any study on whether this method actually works? if it works, is it by' b'actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing' b"the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the" b'too-long eyeball?' b'' b'since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most' b'logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,' b'i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically). has there been' b'any recent studies on this? where can i find them? i know rk works by' b'changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of' b'eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the' b"eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (bates's" b'idea, right?)' b'' b'thanks for any information.' b'' b''
