b'' b'hiyas all,' b'' b'upon getting animated desktop for windows as a gift from my boyfriend, i' b"couldn't wait to install it. i had gotten an advertisement for it and put" b'it aside' b"with my list of 'i wants.' after installing the software, it didn't load." b'no part of' b'the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.' b'' b'i called deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty' b'million different questions about my system.. concluded that i had one of' b'the' b"systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. of course they're" b'willing to' b'give me my back.. what a waste of time and energy. the folks on their' b'support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings' b'of' b'windows b'after my experience with the installation of the sb i learned' b'some of the function of windows dll files. before sending back desktop' b'animator, decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of' b'' b'.dll files i had. i had versions of cpalette.dll one dated and b'100k the' b'other dated and smaller (the smaller version was the one supplied' b'' b'with desktop animator). i moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll' b'to a' b'directory outside my path. (for some reason, i had the older cpalette.dll' b'in my' b'windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\\system directory.)' b"when i did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did other of the" b"applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. does" b'anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions' b'' b'for trouble-shooting?' b'____' b'/ darla' b'/ wix: darla |genie: kuby' b'l_jj \\__jj' b''
