b'' b'hello all,' b' i have a question about satan. i was taught a long time ago' b'that satan was really an angel of god and was kicked out of heaven' b"because he challenged god's authority. the problem is, i cannot" b'find this in the bible. is it in the bible? if not, where did it' b'originate?' b'' b'i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a' b'couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too. as far as' b'i could tell, although that story was never specifically _told_ in the' b'bible, many references are made to it, primarily in the new testament.' b'in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of' b'satan as a (excuse the pun) "devil\'s advocate" for yahweh. see the' b'book of job. getting back to the fallen angel story, there are _no_' b'references to "lucifer" in the bible except for a mistranslation of' b'"the morning star" in the king james version (isaiah which' b'probably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as "the' b'sun king" referred to louis xiv.' b'' b"all in all, i don't know where the story _came from_; it may have been" b'rolling around for a long time, or milton (_paradise lost_) may have' b'invented it. sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this, but i am' b'in a hurry and need to eat lunch! feel free to email me about the' b'other stuff i found out.... (although a lot of it is just the result' b'of a bible concordance program called "quickverse" it\'s really' b"lousy, by the way don't buy it.)" b'' b'wondering,' b'eddie' b'______ o western kentucky b' university b'' b'hope this helped!' b'vera' b'______' b"je cherche une ame, qui\t\t\tof course i don't agree with" b"pourra m'aider\t\t\t\tmylene farmer's religious views;" b"je suis\t\t\t\t\ti just think they're interesting." b"d'une generation desenchantee\t\t(vera noyes)"
