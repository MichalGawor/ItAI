b'' b' attention: mac quadra owners: many storage industry experts have' b' concluded that mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating' b' from the standard scsi specification. this results in silent corruption' b' of data when used with some devices, including ultra-modern devices.' b' although i will not name the devices, since it is not their fault, an' b' example would be a sony inch mo, without the special "mac-compatible"' b' firmware installed. one solution, sometimes, is to disable "blind writes"' b'' b"this doesn't sound right to me. don't quadras use the 53c96? if so, the" b"mac has nothing to do with the scsi timing. that's all handled by the" b'chip. about the only the timing could be wrong is if apple programs the' b'clock registers wrong on the that, however, should only really hurt' b'synchronous transfer, which is not used by the mac scsi manager.' b'' b'furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a quadra.' b'on macs that used the which is a much lower level scsi chip, the' b'mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred. blind' b'mode affected how the mac handled that handshake. on the the' b'handshake is entirely handled by the chip.' b'' b'--tim smith'
