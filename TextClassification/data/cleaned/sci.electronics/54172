b'' b'' b'' b" i'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response" b'to the output from a walkman cassette player. how could i do this?' b"i don't want it just to turn on, i want it to 'strobe' once so to speak," b'per every beep i put on a cassette tape.' b'' b' would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps' b'on the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain' b"frequency? is there any easy way to do either of these? i'm looking for" b"the simplest circuit possible. i guess what i'm asking for is some sort of" b'color organ, but not quite. let me trt to explain again...' b'' b'' b" i'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape." b"so on the tape you'd hear: beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc." b', with speed increasing as time goes on. i want to synchronize an led b'probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. so the led, with' b'each beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort' b'of effect. the rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the' b'rapidity of the blinking of the leds. and if there was no sound on the tape' b'(except for background his), the leds would remain off. please help!' b'' b'' b' thanks,' b'' b' dana' b'' b'try looking in a magizine called radio electronics, may issue,' b'page there is a circuit for a midi light controller there.' b'' b'-=- andy b'' b'_______________________________________________________________________________' b"andy belville it's taken me a long time, but i've" b'_______________________________________________________________________________'
