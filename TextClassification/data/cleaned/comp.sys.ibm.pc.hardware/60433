b'' b"i've been intently following the mag thread while waiting for" b'mine to arrive in the mail. there seems to be a lot of' b'complaints about minor alignment problems with the mx15f. one' b'article contained a comment that the owner called the factory' b'and was told that his screen rotation was within spec b'' b'that figure for image rotation would seem to be a little high...' b'on my nec 5fg the specs call for no greater than 3mm b'' b'well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has' b"a very noticable barrel distortion. it's not dramatic, but it" b"is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't" b'fill the entire screen. the fact that it is worse on the right' b"side doesn't help matters." b'' b"what i'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections" b"are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? i don't want" b'to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse' b'problem. does the factory consider this kind of thing normal' b'and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment?' b'' b"i can't speak for mag innovision but as far as nec is concerned, they are" b'adjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central usa distribution point' b"(ma) for the eastern canadian market. now, here's the key: nec *knows* that" b'the monitors\' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over' b'distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore' b'*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*' b'(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (bull hn' b'information systems in toronto) before sale. this is the correct and' b'probably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor' b'(the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my' b'case quite b'' b'are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?' b'' b'i, for one, was not willing to accept what i considered a substandard' b'monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with nec,' b'finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, imho,' b'but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying' b'convince me was "normal"). the short answer is no, don\'t accept these' b'"imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for the' b'larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and' b"if you're persistent, you'll receive it." b'' b'...............................................................' b": comments and opinions are mine not bnr's b': bell-northern research research triangle park, nc b'...............................................................' b'' b'' b'regards,' b'paul yee'
