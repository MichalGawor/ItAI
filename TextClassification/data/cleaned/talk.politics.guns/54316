b'' b"a poster claims he 'always asks [anti-gunners] what they think would" b"be reasonable personal firepower restrictions'. ok then b'' b'caliber not greater than b'muzzle not greater than ft/lbs with any combo of bullet wt/vel' b'action single shot rifles and single action revolvers' b' revolvers bearing no more than six rounds and incorporating' b" an 'anti-fanning' mechanism to discourage roy rogers wannabes." b'bullets any non-explosive variety, hps just fine.' b'' b'now these specs leave the h&r magnum as about the most powerful' b'allowable civie cartridge for handgun or rifle use. it would be' b'reasonably effective against home intruders, muggers, rabid wolves' b'and other such nasties, even with the firearm-type limitations. at the' b'same time, this caliber/power limit would reduce the ultimate lethality' b'of hits. the chances of the average joe encountering a gang of huge' b'individuals all drunk and stoned on pcp and crystal meth and with a' b"bad attitude and all armed and willing to die well, it's about" b'zero far less than the chances of getting killed driving your car.' b'' b"when will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't" b'primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties' b'in the wild? granted, it is a big part, but we also need military style' b'weapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door.' b'when ten agents come to my door, it would be nice to be able to shoot' b"all of them for 'not upholding the constitution to the best of their" b"ability'. it will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you" b'listed above.' b'' b'please read the federalist papers for all clarification on rkba. these' b'documents have cleared up plenty of misnomers that friends of mine have' b'had.' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'matt porter'
