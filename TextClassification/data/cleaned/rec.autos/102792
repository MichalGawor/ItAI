b'' b'' b"i don't know if some lemons are out there, but from personal experience" b"my brother's has been trouble free. not one single repair, only" b'regular maintainance. the only work he had done on it was a result' b'of his stupidity... he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn' b'on a busy intersection, and was rear-ended. he has a plymouth' b'sundance. i would recomend it, but i would also like to say that if' b'you can wait about six months, chryco is coming out with a new car' b"called the neon, that is built in the same way as the lh's where." b'good luck with your desiscion.' b'' b''
