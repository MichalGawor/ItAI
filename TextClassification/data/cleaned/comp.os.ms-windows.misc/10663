b'' b'' b'is there a hot-key for the windows screen saver utility? if not, is' b'there an easy way to create one? the reason that i need one is that my' b"dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the" b'information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away' b'from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly' b"secure). also, the system manager won't let any software be added so" b'another program such as lock32.zip from cica or a different screen saver' b'is out.' b'' b'thanks for any and all help.' b'--' b'chris putnam (still a blue devils lover at heart)' b'euphonium/baritone' b"star in
