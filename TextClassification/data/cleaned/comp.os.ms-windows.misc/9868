b'' b'' b'has anyone had any experience with a replacement comm driver for windows' b'called turbocomm. i read about it in pcmag apr and am interested' b'but not willing to shell out the bucks the company wants just to try it' b'out. it supposedly eleminates the problems that occur during a high speed' b'file transfer and a disk access made by another program running at the same' b'time. if anyone has any pro/cons about this product, i would be very inter' b'ested to hear them. please email at the address give below. thanks.' b'' b'matthew gibson' b'.' b'' b''
