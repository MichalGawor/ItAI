b'' b'' b" this kind of behavior is what i was shocked by in my 'experience'. for" b' crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers' b" this way and still stay in business? again, i don't expect sales people to" b" bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but i sure don't expect to be" b' abused either. i was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to' b" me and in other 'negotiating' sessions i overheard in neighboring sales" b' cubicles. evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue' b' to do business this way. there must be a lot of people out there who are' b' easy to intimidate.' b'' b'' b'a couple of months ago i went to a dealership to test drive a car. afterwards,' b'we sat down to discuss prices. i explained that i wanted a car just like the' b'one i drove, but in a different color. he said he could get one exactly like' b'i wanted from the dealer network within a day. we then negotiated a price and' b'signed the deal.' b'' b'next day, i get a call. he explains that they goofed, and they had neglected' b'to take into account a price increase. (the last price increase had occurred' b'over months prior to my visit.) if i still wanted the car, i would' b'have to fork over another as an alternative, they would honor the' b'price if i bought the car i test drove (which had been sitting around for' b'6 months and had a few miles on it). i said goodbye. this was a good' b"example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts. it's too" b"bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would" b'no longer be in business.' b'' b'the next dealership i went to was straightforward and honest. first thing the' b'salesman said was, "lets\'s see what you have for dealer cost and work out' b'how much profit i should make." the deal went through with no problems.' b'' b'steve' b'' b''
