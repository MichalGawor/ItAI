b'' b'' b'' b'hi... what alternatives to the express modem do duo owners have (if' b'they want to go at least baud)?' b'' b'every place in town says they are back ordered, and part of the reason' b'i want a laptop mac is so i can use it as a remote terminal from' b'wherever i am, but i really would hate to have to wait months to get' b'a modem in or have to settle with baud.' b'' b"if apple didn't put out such a good product i'd gladly take my" b'business to to the 8-bit ataris. i think the' b'situation with the express modem is inexusable for any business.' b"i've had mine on order since january. apple finally called me last" b'week to tell me that i should have it "by the second week of may."' b"in the meantime, i've been stuck with my duo210 without the" b"connectability i needed it for. i'm sure there are plenty of people" b'who can bite back at me, citing all sorts of reasons why apple is' b"right or at least justified, but i'm just a crabby consumer and" b'when i order a "duo210 with modem" that\'s the product i expect.' b'' b"oh, well. it's not like it's limited to the computer biz. remember" b'when the miata came out? what about those cabbage patch dolls? well,' b'i want my toy! b'' b'' b'' b'--' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------' b'kenneth simon dept of sociology, indiana university' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------'
