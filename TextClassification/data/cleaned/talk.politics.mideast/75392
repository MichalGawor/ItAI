"we did not count the' b'bodies. but the figure seems reasonable. it is no fantasy," mr' b'zen ruffinen said. "we have some idea since we gave the body bags' b'and products to wash the dead."' b'' b'mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the' b'number of dead in the massacre. "don\'t get worked up. it will' b'take several months to get a final figure," the 43-year-old' b'lawyer said at his small office.' b'' b'mr rasulov knows about these things. it took him two years to' b'reach a firm conclusion that people were killed and b'wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist' b'uprising in baku in january b'' b'those nationalists, the popular front, finally came to power' b'three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly' b'what happened when hojali, an azeri town which lies about b'miles from the border with armenia, fell to the armenians.' b'' b'officially, people have so far been certified as dead, being' b'the number of people that could be medically examined by the' b'republic\'s forensic department. "this is just a small percentage' b'of the dead," said rafiq youssifov, the republic\'s chief forensic' b'scientist. "they were the only bodies brought to us. remember the' b'chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury' b'our dead within hours."' b'' b'of these people, were women, and were children under b'years old. gunshots killed people, shrapnel killed and' b'axes or blunt instruments killed exposure in the highland' b'snows killed the last three. thirty-three people showed signs of' b'deliberate mutilation, including ears, noses, breasts or penises' b"cut off and eyes gouged out, according to professor youssifov's" b'report. those bodies examined were less than a third of those' b'believed to have been killed, mr rasulov said.' b'' b"files from mr rasulov's investigative commission are still" b'disorganised lists of azeri militiamen are dead here, six' b'policemen there, and in handwriting of a mosque attendant, the' b'names of corpses brought to be washed in just one day. the' b'most heartbreaking account from witnesses interviewed so far' b'comes from towfiq manafov, an azeri investigator who took a' b'helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on b'february.' b'' b'"there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to' b'count properly: in hojali, people by the stream' b'and the road and visible around nakhchivanik village," mr' b'manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter' b'pilot.' b'' b'"people waved up to us for help. we saw three dead children and' b'one two-year-old alive by one dead woman. the live one was' b'pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. we tried to land but' b'armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to' b'return."' b'' b'there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in' b'circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few' b'months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali' b'at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages' b'taken over by armenian forces.' b'' b"the independent, london, b'' b'' b'heroes who fought on amid the bodies' b'' b'aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the' b'caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in' b'his trousers, torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of' b'hojali just over three months ago, writes hugh pope.' b'' b'"i\'m still wearing the same clothes, i don\'t have any others,"' b'the 51-year-old carpenter said, beginning his account of the' b'hojali disaster. "i was wounded in five places, but i am lucky to' b'be alive."' b'' b'mr sadikov and his wife were short of food, without electricity' b'for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for b'days. they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the' b'2,000 to people left in the straggling azeri town on the' b'edge of karabakh.' b'' b'"at about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard' b'before, eight or nine kinds of weapons, artillery, heavy' b'machine-guns, the lot," mr sadikov said.' b'' b'soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction' b'of the attack. some huddled in shelters but others started' b'fleeing the town, down a hill, through a stream and through the' b'snow into a forest on the other side.' b'' b'to escape, the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam' b'about miles away. they thought they were going to make it,' b'until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two' b'armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak.' b'' b'"none of my group was hurt up to then then we were spotted by' b'a car on the road, and the armenian outposts started opening' b'fire," mr sadikov said.' b'' b'azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward' b'to force open a corridor for the civilians, but their efforts' b'were mostly in vain. mr sadikov said only people from his' b'group of made it through, including his wife and militiaman' b'son. seven of his immediate relations died, including his' b'67-year-old elder brother.' b'' b'"i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat,"' b'he said, pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes. "we' b'have never got any of the bodies back."' b'' b'the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.' b'one hero of the evacuation, alif hajief, was shot dead as he' b"struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's" b'crossing, mr sadikov said.' b'' b'another hero, elman memmedov, the mayor of hojali, said he and' b'several others spent the whole day of february in the bushy' b'hillside, surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three' b'armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.' b'' b'as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam, there was' b'little comfort in a town from which most of the population was' b'soon to flee.' b'' b'"the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian' b'rocket attack. some people just kept going," mr sadikov said. "i' b'had to get to the hospital for treatment. i was in a bad way.' b'they even found a bullet in my sock."' b'' b'victims of war: an azeri woman mourns her son, killed in the' b'hojali massacre in february (left). nurses struggle in primitive' b'conditions (centre) to save a wounded man in a makeshift' b'operating theatre set up in a train carriage. grief-stricken' b'relatives in the town of agdam (right) weep over the coffin of' b'another of the massacre victims. calculating the final death toll' b'has been complicated because muslims bury their dead within b'hours.' b'' b'photographs: liu heung ap' b'frederique lengaigne reuter' b'' b"the independent, london, b'' b'serdar argic' b'' b"'we closed the roads and mountain passes that" b'might serve as ways of escape for the turks' b"and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'" b'(ohanus appressian b"'in soviet armenia today there no longer exists" b"a single turkish soul.'
