b'' b'' b'' b' you are experiencing what is called macrovision. it is the protection' b' that they use on the video tapes. there are two ways around this that i' b' know of. first of all, you can try using a different vcr to copy onto.' b' it is the input of the vcr that reacts to the protection so sometimes' b' just switching the two vcrs around will take care of it. some models' b" just don't react to it." b'' b' does this also affect the viewing of tapes i have had problems with' b' a couple of rented tapes; they were virtually unviewable. i fiddled' b' with the tuning, tracking and vertical hold but it was no good.' b'' b'' b'' b'it sounds like your tv is one of the ones that also reacts to the video' b'protection. (poor you!)' b'' b'the macroscrubber from radio electronics removes the protection so you' b"souldn't have any more problems. however, if you use the method of" b"copying it from one vcr to another where the second vcr doesn't react to" b'the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the' b'protection.' b'' b'one thought comes to mind about your problem... when playing the tape' b'for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source vcr through an' b'extra device before going to the tv? if you feed it through a second vcr' b'first, that is your problem. as to other devices such as converters, i' b"don't know if they would react or not. just to be safe, you might want" b'to make sure that you have nothing between the vcr and tv.' b'' b'the inquiring mind bbs, winnipeg, manitoba
