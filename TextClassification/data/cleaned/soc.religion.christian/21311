b'' b"i have seen the claims, but i don't know if there are any" b'authenticated cases of people making prolonged speeches in' b'real languages they don\'t know. from my observations, "speaking' b'in tongues" in practice has nothing at all do with this.' b'' b'i have a simple test. i take several people who can speak' b'only one language (e.g. chinese, russian, german, english).' b'then i let the "gifted one" start "speaking in toungues".' b'the audience should understand the "gifted one" clearly' b'in their native language. however, the "gifted one" can' b'only hear himself speaking in his own language.' b'' b'works everytime. b'perhaps i would believe the "gifted ones" more if they were' b"glorifying god rather than themselves. then perhaps we'd" b'witness a real miracle.' b'' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b"mark ashley |disclaimer: my opinions. not harris'" b'the lost los angelino
