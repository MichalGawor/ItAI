b'' b' i just read articals on this in road and track and car and driver' b' (is that one mag or two? =b^), and i was wondering if people out' b' there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to say...' b'' b'depending on how you plan to use your suv, i might recommend also' b'browsing trailer boats and one or more of those pickup, shotgun,' b'and 4wd magazines. the car rags mostly seem to consider recently' b'graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips' b'to be a bedload. considering that most of these suvs seem to be' b"used mostly as robust station wagons, that's probably not a bad" b'approach, but if your applications are more demanding, pick your' b'information sources accordingly.' b'' b'of the three vehicles on your short list (explorer, 4runner,' b"pathfinder), i'd recommend the 4runner as being closely based" b'on a rather robust pickup and the explorer for being comfortably' b"carlike. don't know much about the pathfinder." b'' b'good luck,' b'--joe' b'"just another personal opinion from the people\'s republic of berkeley"'
