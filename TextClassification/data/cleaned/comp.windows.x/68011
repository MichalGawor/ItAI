b'' b'' b'|' b"| ever since i started to use xwindows (which is to say recently) i've" b'| accumulated a few questions about x-applications. three examples follow:' b'|' b'| it was recently mentioned on comp.os.linux that there exists a post-' b'| script viewer. i am interested in this and any x-editor that is an' b'| improvement on xedit (which i find annoying).' b'' b"try to get axe it's a wonderful x based editor and much simpler to use than" b'emacs what is a overkill. of course, emacs is no editor but a religion.' b'' b'| at one point i was the proud owner of an amiga (and have since upgraded' b'| to a workbench (the point-and click interface) used ".info"' b'| files to store the data for icons associated with applications on a given' b'| volume. i have noticed no such architecture anywhere under linux; how' b'| does xwindows associate icons with applications? can one edit icons or' b'| generate new ones for applications somehow?
