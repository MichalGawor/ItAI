b'' b'i have a mac plus with 2.5mb ram. i have just bought an extra 2mb so that' b"i can have the max 4mb ram that a plus supports. however, i can't get it" b'to boot after i install the extra simms. instead i get a sad mac (sorry,' b"but i can't remember the code). looking at the motherboard, i can see" b'that resistors have been snipped off where it says "256kb path b'1 row". i assume that was done when the first 1mb simms were added.' b'' b'so, my question is: are there any other resistors that need snipping?' b'or, do i have bum simms which need to be exchanged?' b'' b'any and all advice will be appreciated.' b'' b'chris gatenby'
