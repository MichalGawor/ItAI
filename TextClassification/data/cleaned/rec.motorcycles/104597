b'' b'' b"hey ed, how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horse's reins" b'left to go left? or am i confusing two threads here?' b'' b'three, actually. i believe i discussed countersteering a horse' b'before.' b'' b'basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and' b'neck-rein. plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and' b'you pull in the direction you wish to go. neck-reining steers a horse' b'by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the' b"horse's neck in the direction you wish to go. when training a" b'plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins' b'under his necks. thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein' b'pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit' b'(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).' b'' b'are you sorry you asked yet?' b'' b'---' b'ed green, former ninjaite |i was drinking last night with a biker,' b'dod |"go on, get to know her, you\'ll like her!"' b'(the grateful dead) |it seemed like the least i could do...' b''
