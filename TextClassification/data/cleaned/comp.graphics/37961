b'' b'' b" i've used the recently-released macintosh application mpeg to quicktime to" b' convert the excellent mpeg "canyon.mpg" into a quicktime movie. while' b' anyone who would want this movie is perfectly able to convert it' b" themselves, i thought i'd let the net know that i'd be glad to mail copies" b' of mine out. the movie conversion took close to six hours on my poor' b" little iicx; in other words, unless you've got a quadra, you might not want" b' to tie up your machine in converting this file.' b'' b' the movie is a fast fly-through of a fractal-generated canyon landscape.' b' the movie is seconds long, and uses the compact video compressor (i.e.,' b' quicktime v1.5). the movie looks okay on 8-bit displays, and looks' b' absolutely awesome on and 24-bit displays.' b'' b" i'd be happy to mail this movie to the first or so people who ask for" b' it. the only caveat is you need to be able to receive a nine-megabyte mail' b" message (the movie was stuff-it'ed down to seven megs, but binhex ruined" b" that party). if more then people want this movie, then it's just more" b" evidence that the net needs a dedicated quicktime ftp archive site. c'mon," b" someone's gotta have a spare 1.2gb drive out there..." b'' b"okay, i've received a whole lot of requests for the movie, so for" b"simplicity's sake i can't mail out any more than i've already received (as" b"of edt, tuesday). maybe it'll pop up on a site sooner or later." b'' b'==============================================================================' b'rensselaer polytechnic institute welcome to macintosh.' b'troy, new york, usa b'=============================================================================='
