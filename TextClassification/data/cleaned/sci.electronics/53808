b'' b'' b'greetings!' b'' b" situation: i have a phone jack mounted on a wall. i don't" b" know the number of the line. and i don't want" b' to call up the operator to place a trace on it.' b'' b' question: is there a certain device out there that i can' b' use to find out the number to the line?' b' thanks for any response.' b' al' b'' b'' b'' b'do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack?? if not,' b'then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction' b'box. if you do get a dial tone, then surely the telco is sending a bill' b'for the line to *someplace* or *somebody*. are you sure that what you' b'are doing is on the level. sounds to me like you are just trying to get' b"at somebody's unlisted number. fess up." b'' b'keith' b'' b'' b'--' b"| keith boyd (ncr- mcpd cola.) nothing could be finer than huntin' and b"| platt springs rd. and fishin' in south carolina! -me- b'| vp: or from uunet: uunet!ncrcom!ncrcae!clodii!keith
