b'' b'' b'' b' this was known as *journey to the far side of the sun* in the united' b' states and as *doppelganger* in the u.k... later, they went' b' on to do more live-action sf series: *ufo* and *space: b' b' the astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, vtol' b' airliners, and mighty portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to' b' look at.' b'' b'exactly. some of the space:1999 effects remain first-rate even today.' b'' b' they recycled a lot of models and theme music for ufo. some of the' b' concepts even showed up in space: b'' b'' b'later on, the andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some' b'of the worst pseudo-scientific shows in tv history by flying "into infinity."' b'this was a one-off thing done as part of bbc\'s "educational sf" series "the' b'day after tomorrow." the anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of' b'reaching the speed of light ("lightship altares"), the four-man crew eventually' b'journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (i' b'think). i saw this as a 9-year-old back in and liked it very much, but' b'then again i was a fan of space:1999 so i guess i was easily satisfied in those' b'days:-)' b'---' b'does anyone know if "into infinity" has been released on video? i have some' b'space:1999 shows on vhs and know that thunderbirds etc. also are available in' b'england.' b'' b'marcu$' b'' b" software engineering? that's like military intelligence, isn't it?"
