b'' b'me the understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among' b'me the accident-involved riders in the hurt study.' b'' b'mike i would agree entirely with these three paragraphs. but did the hurt' b'mike study make any distinction between an *ability* to swerve and a *failure*' b'mike to swerve?' b'' b'yes, it was specifically the *ability* or understanding of the' b'technique which was absent. we have made a lot of progress between' b'rider education and responsibility over the last ten-twenty years...' b'but i am still amazed anytime i teach an erc how many people of many' b'year riding experience "discover" countersteering for cornering or' b'swerving.' b'' b'mike everything else. hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive' b'mike manouvres did hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally' b'mike preferable?' b'' b'the specific recommandation cited in the hurt study was that a formal' b'"street strategy", like sipde for example, was the most important' b'component of any rider education curriculum. the specific skills of' b'emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced' b'as well, but more significant was that of rider did nothing' b'confronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or' b'fell over as a result of rider error. the choice of specific maneuver' b'is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and' b'the proper execution of any effective countermeasure.' b'--' b'chemistry dept., harvard univ.
