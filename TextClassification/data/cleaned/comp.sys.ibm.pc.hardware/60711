b'' b'hi there. we just bought a dx2/66 gateway system with a meg ati' b'ultra pro video card. everything seems to work fine except for the' b'windows drivers for 800x600 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 bit' b'modes. the fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,' b'and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally' b'unintelligible. naturally, i called gateway tech support to inquire' b'about this. the technician asked me about the drivers, and i told him it' b'was version build he told me that the and bit drivers for' b"the ati ultra pro simply do not work!!! is this true? if so, i'm simply" b'amazed. how could this be? the strange thing is i would have expected' b'to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the faq!!!).' b'' b'one very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none' b'of the windows accelerator boards have working and/or bit drivers' b"for windows i easily challenged him on that because i've been" b'running a diamond 24x in bit mode at home for months now, and i have' b'tested and used the bit mode as well. he then backed off and said:' b'"well, diamond has been working on those drivers much longer." anyway, i' b'just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about' b'it. any feedback will be appreciated.' b'' b'the system configuration is:' b'' b'gateway dx2/66 local bus' b'16 megs ram' b'scsi hd cd-rom' b'ultrastor 34f local bus scsi controller' b'ati ultra pro local bus with 2mb vram' b'dos b'windows b'mach drivers version (build b'' b'thanks in advance.' b'--'
