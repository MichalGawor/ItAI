b'' b"i'm no expert at ups's, but you said something that made it sound like" b"you didn't realize something. on a typical ups (well, on ours, anyway)," b'there is no switchover from ac to dc. all the protected equipment is' b'always running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual' b'condition of also having them on charge. if the power fails, big deal b'the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but' b"there's something like car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it" b'takes a while).' b'' b'if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter,' b"why not do it all the time? then there'd be no switchover to screw" b'things up, and no having to sense the failure fast. just keep the dc' b"on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when" b'you "need" it.' b'' b"just some ideas. can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at least" b'some of this helped.'
