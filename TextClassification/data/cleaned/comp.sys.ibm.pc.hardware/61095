b'' b'hi,' b'that might look like a dull request, but i have been following this newgroup' b"for a couple of weeks and it didn't help me make my mind." b'' b'i bought a new machine not long ago after being disconnected from the' b'pc world for a while (i have been running on an xt 5mhz till last january!!).' b'the machine i bought came equipped with a ati vga xl graphic card. it' b'gives a very nice picture and the windows drivers are pretty stable. the only' b'problem is that it is quite slow.' b'' b'i would like to go for a faster card (not in the range). i saw a lot' b"of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall" b'picture clear enough to make a choice. my question is could somebody' b'direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.' b'i would like to get information about b'- the refresh rates the various cards provide;' b'- quality of windows drivers;' b'- standard vga performance (non-windows stuff).' b'' b'direct me to a magazine article or something like that (i got winvid.zip' b'info, but it is not enough). if you have an isa card you are really satisfied' b'with it, let me know.' b'if this information is of any use, here is my system configuration:' b'- fujikama 33mhz isa system (contaq motherboard)' b'- monitor darius non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024x768)' b'(can reach 70khz horizontally)' b'' b'i would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow' b'screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the eprom of the' b'graphic card. this is the case with my ati card and it is very convenient' b'when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent' b'enough to record settings.' b'' b"merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me," b'' b'guy lamouche' b''
