b'' b'i am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being' b'clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. i have reprogrammed' b'the f1 key to transmit a <ff <be character sequence by using the' b'following line in .xdefaults:' b'' b'~ctrl ~shift ~alt <key f1 string(0xff) string(0xbe) \\n\\' b'' b'i merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm' b'which has the remapped f1 key. the problem that arises is that the' b'application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f <3e' b'sequence, which is <ff <be with the high order bit of each' b'character being filtered or ignored.' b'' b'when i run xev and press the f1 key, i get the correct value showing' b'up in the following two key events:' b'' b'keypress event, serial synthetic no, window 0x2800001,' b'root 0x28, subw 0x0, time root:(74,104),' b'state 0x0, keycode (keysym 0xffbe, f1), same_screen yes,' b'xlookupstring gives characters: b'' b'keyrelease event, serial synthetic no, window 0x2800001,' b'root 0x28, subw 0x0, time root:(74,104),' b'state 0x0, keycode (keysym 0xffbe, f1), same_screen yes,' b'xlookupstring gives characters: b'' b'notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe.' b'but when i use the f1 key while in vi or in a program i wrote to' b'spit back the hex values of keyboard input, i only get <7f <3e.' b'' b'does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what' b'i can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to' b'the final application? any help is greatly appreciated.' b'' b'please *email* any responses.' b'' b'jim kavitsky'
