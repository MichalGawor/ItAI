b'' b'date: thu, apr gmt' b'' b'[lots of editing out of previuos posts]' b'' b'here is another anecdotal story. i am a picky eater and never wanted to' b'try chinese food, however, i finally tried some in order to please a' b'girl i was seeing at the time. i had never heard of chinese restaurant' b'syndrome. a group of us went to the restaurant and all shared different' b"dishes. it didn't taste great, but i decided it wasn't so bad. we went" b'home and went to bed early. i woke up at am and puked my guts outs.' b"i threw up for so long that (i'm not kidding) i pulled a muscle in" b"my tongue. dry heaves and everything. no one else got sick, and i'm" b'not allergic to anything that i know of.' b'' b'suffice to say that i wont go into a chinese restaurant unless i am' b'physically threatened. the smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is*' b'a psycholgical reaction). when i have been dragged in to suffer' b'through beef and broccoli without any sauces, i insist on no msg.' b"i haven't gotten sick yet." b'' b'funny about that... my wife (my girlfriend at the time) used to get sick' b'after eating certain foods at various asian restaurants, and never knew' b"why. she'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously. a couple of us" b'ventured a connection with msg, and her response was: "msg? what\'s that?".' b'it also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and' b"chips... which i noticed (later) had msg on the label. don't know about" b'double blinds, but avoiding msg has stopped her being sick at restaurants.' b'' b'' b'cheers, john' b'' b'institute for biological sciences, national research council of canada,' b'cell physiology group. ottawa, ontario, canada.' b"*** disclaimer: all opinions are mine, not nrc's!
