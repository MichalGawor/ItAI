b'' b'hi. i am having some interesting problems with my boca graphics card, which' b'is based on the cirrus logic chipset (i am not sure exactly which one). the' b'problem is as follows:' b'' b'if i use any windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64k-colour driver (ie' b'16 colour or colour), the image on screen becomes too tall no amount of' b'resizing on the monitor will make it fit. and if i use excel with the 64k-' b'colour driver, it hangs as soon as it loads. anyone out there used this' b'card/experienced anything similar.' b'' b'please reply by mail, and i will post any solutions here.' b'' b'regards' b'' b'- simon' b'' b'' b'--' b'' b'' b'+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+' b'| simon bernstein "man is condemned to be free" (sartre) b'| university of natal, durban b'+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+'
