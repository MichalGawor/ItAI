b'' b'i am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a' b'remote display. a local display being connected to the same system' b'that the client is executing on. i have access to the display string' b'but can i tell from the string?' b'' b'if the client is executing on host foo then "unix:0", "foo:0",' b'and "localhost:0" are all local. under ultrix, i believe that' b'"local:0" is also a valid display name (a shared memory connection' b'maybe?). are there other strings that i should check for? is there a' b'better way to detect this?' b'' b'thank you for any help you can give me.' b'--' b'========================================================================' b'jim atkinson\t\twavefront technologies, inc.' b'=================== life is not a spectator sport!
