b'' b" i'm interested in buying or building an omnidirectional antenna for the" b' commercial fm band (88-108mhz). the commonly sold ones are a folded dipole' b' bent in an "s" shape; and one with a pair of crossed dipoles. i don\'t see' b" either of these designs as exhibiting any gain, and they probably aren't" b' truely omnidirectional.' b'' b'' b" i'm intrigued by the discone antenna. does anyone have detailed information" b' on how to design one for the fm band (with 75-ohm impedence)?? is one' b' commercially available?? are there other designs that have gain??' b'' b' i already own a 10-element fm yagi. it works great, but requires frequent' b' rotation for those distant stations.' b'' b' brad beer, castle gate drive, beavercreek, oh b'' b'brad,' b'for an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality. the only way' b'to get gain out of an antenna is to design in directionality. the' b'"gain" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred' b'direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.' b'' b'bob sciamanda' b'edinboro univ of pa'
