b'' b"i'm interested in simulating reverse (or negative) color video" b'mathematically. what is the transform? is it a simple' b'reversal of the hue value in the hsv color space? is it' b'a manipulation in the yuv color space? how is it related' b'to solarization?' b'' b'if you want to see something truly wild, turn on the' b'reverse video effect on a camcorder so equipped,' b'and point it at the monitor. this creates a chaotic' b'dynamical system whose phase space is continuous along' b'rotation, zoom, focus, etc. very very surprising and' b"lovely. i'd like to write a simulation of this effect" b'without analog grunge. thanks for any info you may have.' b'' b"please e-mail any info to me. i'll post a summary." b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'--' b'' b'lance norskog' b'data is not information is not knowledge is not wisdom.'
