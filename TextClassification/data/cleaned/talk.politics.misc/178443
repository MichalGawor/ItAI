b'' b'i am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial' b'and repression, and should acknowledge such. the united states, with' b'its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the' b'loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional' b'protections of citizens. this recognition has taken the form of the' b"civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such" b'as usc et. seq., usc et. seq, et. al.' b'with this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the' b'form of collective guilt, i want people to recognize denial.' b'though it can be said that white people numerically commit more' b'crimes in the united states, because white people are a majority,' b'it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate' b'amount of crime in the united states, in their relation to their' b'numbers in population.' b'my views are out of experiences when i was a police officer' b'in a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen. unless people' b'account for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate' b'community, nothing will improve.' b'' b'regards,' b'' b'neal' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b''
