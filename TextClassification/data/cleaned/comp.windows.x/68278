b'' b'' b'hi all,' b'' b"i've read the faq, i've fiddled around, but i am still having problems getting" b'my poor old hp9000/300 to let me input/display characters above i have' b'the following in my .xdefaults:' b'' b'xterm*font -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1' b'' b'so i believe that i have the correct font selected to use in xterm. i have not' b'set my lc_ctype environment variable because whatever i put it, it tells me that' b'that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,' b"or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist). i can get some of the characters" b"above to print out, but they are not where i'd expect them for example," b'alt-v does not produce a u umlaut. this leads me to believe that the fault' b'lies with the stty settings, which are as follows:' b'' b'speed baud; line susp <undef; dsusp <undef' b'-parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts' b'-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc' b'ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak' b'isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh' b'opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop' b'' b"anyway, i've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help" b'anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.' b'' b'' b'thanks!' b'' b'brendan'
