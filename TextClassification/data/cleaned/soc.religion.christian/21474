(de nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)]' b'' b'why is it fair to punish you, me and the rest of humanity because of' b'what adam and eve did? suppose your parents committed some crime before' b'you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in' b"jail for it. would you really think that is fair? i know i wouldn't."
