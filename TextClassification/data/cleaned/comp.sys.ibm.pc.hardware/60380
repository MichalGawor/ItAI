b'' b"i'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead and" b"could use some feedback on a couple systems i'm looking at if anyone is" b'familiar with them.' b'' b'the system that looks the most interesting is the budget vlb' b'tower. for about (delivered) it offers vlb, 8mb, 200mb ide, a mitsumi' b'cd-rom (with software bundle), media vision sound board, ctx 1468ni,' b'128k cache, and the usual drives, ports, os software. since my budget is' b'$2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it' b"is too good to be true, of course). among other things, i've never seen a" b'review of the budget systems (or their parent company, micro smart), or of' b'the motherboard they are using (the aetana). any feedback would be' b'appreciated.' b'' b"in a similar vein, the second system i'm considering midwest micro's" b'elite vesa tower with a diamond viper (2mb) midwest micro mi' b"monitor is one i've never seen reviewed anywhere. i'm familiar with the" b'firm but not the product line and some idea of their quality would be abig' b'benefit here as well.' b'' b'any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated my' b'greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities.' b'' b'email response would be greatly appreciated.' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'--' b'' b'-=*=- b'the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised' b'over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to' b'prevent harm to others. his own good, either physical or moral, is' b'not a sufficient warrant. john stuart mill' b'-=*=-
