b'' b"i'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a novell" b'network (using shell version i think). the workstation, a was set' b'up to run windows with the network about a year ago. needless to say,' b"i'd like to upgrade it to windows and have it work with the network." b'' b"basically, the windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but" b"several dos applications, like word perfect, will be on the network. i'd" b'mainly want windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and' b'perhaps handle some network functions as well. if i could multitask the dos' b"apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but i could live" b'without it.' b'' b"eventually, i'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working" b'with the network and windows as well. (however, most of the terminals' b'are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much dos-bound, and i guess that' b"leaves out windows for workgroups.) and in the future, maybe there'd be" b"norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself." b'' b"as you can guess, i've never done anything like this before. i've" b"read through the networks material that came with windows, but still, i'd" b'like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.' b'' b"please reply by email. i don't scan these newsgroups often." b'' b'thanks for any replies.' b'' b'' b'' b'"well, i\'ll know right away by the look in her eyes' b"she's lost all illusions and she's worldly wise, and i know" b"if i give her a listen, she's what i've been missing, what i've been missing" b"i'll be lost in love and havin' some fun with my cynical girl" b'who\'s got no use for the real world, i\'m looking for a cynical girl"' b'--- marshall crenshaw, "cynical girl"'
