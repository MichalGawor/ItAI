b'' b'having read in the past about the fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft, i had' b'assumed that the command loss timer had that sort of function. however i' b'always find disturbing the oxymoron of a "no-op" command that does something.' b'if the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not' b'a "no-op" command.' b'' b'of course this terminology comes from a jet propulsion laboratory which has' b'nothing to do with jet propulsion.' b'' b'' b"i don't know where you got this idea from, jpl's history dates back to" b'to the 1930s when a caltech professor named von karman conducted' b'experiments in rocket propulsion with a group of graduate students' b'on the present site of the jet propulsion laboratory. the army started' b'funding the laboratory and had jurisdiction untill the late 1950s when' b'nasa took over. the early research conducted at the laboratory' b'led to many applications the first being jet-assisted takeoff rockets' b"for aircraft. i think this should explain where jpl got it's name, i" b'should know, i worked there for five wonderful years.' b'----------mike.' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'bnr ltd. bnrgate.bnr.ca!bcars5!jcobban fax: b'' b''
