b'' b'i have an old mac plus. a couple of years ago i bought a shiney new lc.' b"it came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with" b'a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you' b'very much).' b'' b'well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus' b"but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard" b"input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my" b"local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell" b'me the order of the wires.' b'' b'there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. i know' b"one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies volts, and" b'i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong' b"you'll fry a board and i <really don't want to do <that." b'' b'if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your' b'experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially' b"since apple's original keyboard is not ergonomically correct." b'' b'btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the' b'correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it' b'has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of' b'little boxes). oh, well b'' b'one more thing: in case you are thinking that the abd ports on the' b'newer models are different from the connection used on the plus---' b"you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus" b'and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in' b'other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible.' b"it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order." b'' b'omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution' b'so others can, too. thanx for the input.' b'' b'*****************************************************************' b'* tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath, b'* from the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death, b'* from the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud, b'* o, why should the spirit of mortal be proud? b'* -william knox b'*****************************************************************' b'*****************************************************************'
