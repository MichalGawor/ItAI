b'' b'' b'it did it again. this morning, my ford ranger was idling at rpm.' b'ok, so i exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast. it has a b'liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would' b"cause the idle to drop back to normal (i don't think the linkage is stuck)." b'what can i do to fix this problem? this has been a problem from time to' b"time, but has straightened itself out until now. i don't have a tach," b'but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast' b'as it should be. this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up' b'at a stop light.' b'' b'sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. the' b'pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold' b'weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. locate the' b'fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a' b"normal idle. if so, locate the diaphram and test it. if you can't apply" b'suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will' b"cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced." b'' b'bernie lofaso' b'applied research labs'
