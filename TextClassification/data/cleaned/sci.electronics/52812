b'' b'' b'from what i understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive' b'device much like the radio in your car. they work as an antenna picking' b'up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out. therefore there would' b'be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of' b'detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.' b'' b'' b"unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts. the most common method of" b'implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator. the' b"local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via" b'the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great' b'care.' b'' b'for a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _spy catcher_.' b'the author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local' b'oscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for british' b'intelligence.' b'' b'-greg' b'--' b'fortune cookie: radioactive cats have half-lives.' b':::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::'
