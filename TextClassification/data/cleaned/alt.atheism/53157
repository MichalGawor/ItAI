b'' b': the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime, but the legal' b': shenanigans that have been added (automatic appeals, lengthy court' b': battles, etc.) have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what' b': it should be. hence the question is, do we instate the death penalty as' b': it was meant to be, and see if that deters crime, or do we get rid of' b': it entirely?' b'' b'i doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a "deterrent" to crime. if so,' b"why doesn't every crime carry a death penalty that would be effictive" b"wouldn't it b'' b'the death penalty is a punishment, much like a fine for speeding is' b"a punishment. anyway, somebody with murder on the mind doesn't much care" b'about the consequences. i think another problem is that people dont think' b"they will get caught. if i wanted to kill another person, i wouldn't" b"care what the penalty was if i didn't think i would get caught." b'' b'if it was to be strictly a deterrent, it should have been more along' b'the lines of torture.' b'' b'dave fuller' b''
