b'' b'' b'' b' i have a 486sx25 computer with a mg seagate ide drive and a controler' b' built into the motherboard. i want to add a scsi drive (a quantum prodrive' b' 425f mg formatted). i have no documentation at all and i need your' b' help!' b'' b' as i understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive. could you' b" please tell me if i'm right.." b'' b' buy a scsi contoler. which one? i know adaptec is good, but they are' b' kind of expensive. are there any good boards in the region? i want' b' it to be compatible with os2 and unix if possible. also, i have seen on' b' the net that there are scsi and scsi2 drives. is this true? does the' b' adapter need to be the same as the drive? what type of drive is the' b' quantum?' b'' b'' b'i have tried others, but i think that the adaptec is best value for money.' b'' b'' b' connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power cable.' b' do i have to worry about the power supply? i think i have watts and' b" all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive." b'' b'' b'i dont think you can mix the two types of drive, unless you have one of the' b'scsi/ide cards that is available. you will have to turn your ide off.' b'' b'' b' setup the bios to recognize the drive as the second drive. what type' b" of drive is this? i don't have the numbers for this drive." b'' b'' b'instructions for drive type are included with the controller. with some it may be' b'a type no matter what the disk is. with others it may be a type i had one' b'controller that i had to tell the bios that no hard disk was installed.' b'' b'' b' format and create partitions on the drive. do i use format or fdisk? i' b" think that ide drives can't be low-level formatted. is it the same with" b' scsi? how exactly does fdisk work? i have a reduced msdos manual' b' (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk. ideally, i would want' b' the drive partitioned in to two partitions d: and e: how do i do this?' b'' b'' b'do not low level format a scsi unless you have the scsi low level format program.' b'first use fdisk to set the partitions, then use format.' b'' b'' b" well that seems to be all. is there anythiing i'm forgetting?" b" any help is *really* appreciated, i'm lost..." b'' b' -eric' b'' b'--' b'mark' b'______________________________________________________________________________'
