b'' b'i like what mr. joseph biden had to say yesterday in the senate.' b'' b'condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans' b'and calling that "moral rape".' b'' b'he went on to say that the reason for that is "out right religious' b'bigotry"' b'' b'' b'mohamed' b'' b'biden spoke well. then there was john major, the architect of the' b'betrayal of bosnian muslims to genocide.' b'' b'he basically has given yet another green light to hvo ustashe and' b'mladic-chetnik serial killers, rapists, and plunderers to continue their' b'genocide against bosnian muslims.' b'' b'but major met with mr. rushdie and said it was "unacceptable" that iran' b'should have a death decree on him. while i disagree personally with' b'fetwas against hack writers like rushdie (it only helps them sell more' b'books), i find it interesting that mr. major finds the genocide of two' b'million muslims in bosnia acceptable, but a threat against one single' b'popular british writer "unacceptable."' b'--' b'michael sells, department of religion, haverford college' b'haverford, pa
