b'' b' i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (vs.' b' a blank screen) by monitoring the r,g, and b outputs of a graphics' b' card. it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at' b' mhz, which would mean detecting a ns pulse. it should also be' b' able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about mv)' b' and a dim screen (say, around mv). oh yes, it also needs to be' b' cheap. in' b' fact the difference between completely black and completely white is' b' only mv. i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the' b' video signals to make this work.' b'' b'try a differential amplifier. put back-to-back diodes between the collectors' b'restrict the voltage swing. have ma flow, with ohm collector rs, and' b'keep the stray c below pf. try 2n5179s. run collector to your logic.' b'allen sullivan' b'' b'' b''
