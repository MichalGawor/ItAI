b'' b'can someone please tell me where i can ftp dta or dmorph?' b'' b"dmorf (dave's morph, i think is what it means) and dtax (dave's" b'tga assembler) are available in the msdos_uploads directory' b'on the wuarchive.' b'' b'they are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,' b'dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe' b'there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or' b'dtax.exe.' b'' b'i downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing' b'away the afternoons since. the programmes are all a bit buggy and' b'definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very' b'well written.' b'' b'the interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you' b'figure out the tricks.' b'' b'i have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph' b"without using the splines option. not sure why, since i don't have" b'the source. i think it was written for tp b'' b'if anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing' b'to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time' b'just to figure out that if i just used the durned splines then' b'it would work...' b'' b'jna' b'' b'-ryan'
