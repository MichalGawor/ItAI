b'' b'let me remind all of those muslim-haters out there who like to' b"mention the mufti's cooperation with germany as a reason to let muslims" b'be slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts:' b'' b'1)why blame the muslims for what the nazis did and forgive italy, the croats,' b'and many other europeans for being real allies to hitler?' b'' b'2)why blame muslims for supporting germany the enemy of their enemy' b'at the time (britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible' b'for most atrocities against muslims in the region) and forgive germany itself' b'eventhough it is the one who created nazism?' b'' b'3)as far as muslims are concerned there was no difference between' b'nazi germany, and antimuslim colonialist britain/france in they were' b'all racist, anti-arab, and full of arrogance and hate. wwii and the wars' b'in algeria, sudan, and other places proved that very clearly. even anti-' b'semitism was not more spread in germany than in france or britain, it just' b'happened to be official policy in germany.' b'' b'and we will forgive you, just set our countries free.' b'' b'so any arguments about wwii behaviour coming from the people who' b'killed millions in that war (from either side) is just plain laughable.' b'enough said.'
