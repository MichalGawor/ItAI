b'' b'' b' b' deletions...' b' er, jon, what ken said was:' b' b' there have previously been people like you in your country. unfortunately,' b' b' most jews did not survive.' b' b' that sure sounds to me like ken is accusing the guy of being a nazi.' b'' b" hitler and the nazis didn't spring fully formed from the forehead" b" of athena. they didn't invent anti-semitism. they built on a" b' foundation of anti-semitism that was already present in germany.' b' this foundation of anti-semitism was laid down, not by the nazis,' b' but by the people i listed, and also by hundreds of years of unthinking,' b' knee-jerk bigotry, on the part of perfectly ordinary people, and, of' b' course, their pastors and priests.' b'' b' what we have to worry about today is not whether some hollywood' b' hitler in a black uniform is going to come striding onto the german' b' stage in one unprepared step, but whether those same bedrock foundations' b' of anti-semitism are being laid down, little by little, in germany,' b' as we speak.' b'' b' and if so, they will be laid down, not by hitlers and himmlers, who' b' will come later, but by "people like" the poster in question. the' b' people who think that casual anti-semitism is acceptable, or even fun.' b' b'' b'deletions...' b' i did. now may i suggest, with the greatest possible respect, that' b' you go read some history?' b'' b' jon.' b'' b"so, you consider the german poster's remark anti-semitic? perhaps you" b"imply that anyone in germany who doesn't agree with israely policy in a" b'nazi? pray tell, how does it even qualify as "casual anti-semitism"?' b"if the term doesn't apply, why then bring it up?" b'' b'your own bigotry is shining through.' b'--' b'' b'disclaimer: the opinions expressed in this posting are mine' b'solely and do not represent my employer in any way.'
