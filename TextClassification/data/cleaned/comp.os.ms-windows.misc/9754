b'' b'hi,' b'i am working on gathering data on the way that users use' b'computers. this involves getting subjects to type and use a' b'mouse. i want to be able to watch what they are doing without' b'being in the same room. it would be ideal if i could watch' b'the session on another monitor without the subjects knowledge.' b'i believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for' b'short distances, ie <5m. i will need to be approx 10m away, as' b'the cable travels.' b"the pc's are connected to a tcp\\ip network and run windows b'is there any software that will allow me to watch what is' b'happening on another pc?' b'thanks' b'regards' b'jon gough' b'trust project'
