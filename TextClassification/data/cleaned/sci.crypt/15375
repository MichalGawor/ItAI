b'' b' short summary of what bellovin says hellman says the nsa says: there is' b' a global key g, plus one key u_c for each chip c. the user can choose a' b' new session key k_p for each phone call p he makes. chip c knows three' b" keys: g, its own u_c, and the user's k_p. the government as a whole" b' knows g and every u_c. apparently a message m is encrypted as' b" e_g(e_{u_c}(k_p),c) e_{k_p}(m). that's it." b'' b" the system as described here can't possibly work. what happens when" b' someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? to get m' b' the receiving chip needs k_p; to get k_p the receiving chip needs u_c.' b' the only information it can work with is c. if u_c can be computed' b' from c then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key' b" escrow'' is bullshit. otherwise how is a message decrypted?" b'' b"via k_p, of course. nothing was said about where k_p comes from. it's" b"the session key, though, and it's chosen however you usually choose" b'session keys exponential key exchange, shared secret, rsa, etc.' b'but however you choose it, the chip will apparently emit the escrow' b'header when you do.'
