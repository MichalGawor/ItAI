b'' b"one thing that i haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the" b'relation between ibd inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty' b'acids (fas).' b'' b"i was diagnosed last may w/crohn's of the terminal ileum. when i got" b'out of the hospital i read up on it a bit, and came across several' b'studies investigating the role of epa (an essentially fa) in reducing' b'inflammation. the evidence was mixed. [many of these studies are' b'discussed in "inflammatory bowel disease," macdermott, stenson. b'' b'but if i recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be' b'picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). in' b'the studies patients were given epa (a few grams/day for most of the' b'studies), but, if i recall correctly, there was no restriction of the' b'_other_ fas that the patients could consume. from the informed' b"layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. if lots of n-6 fas are" b'consumed along with the epa, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoid' b'products to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad."' b"isn't this ratio the issue?" b'' b"what's the view of the gastro. community on epa these days? epa" b'supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other fas' b'appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the' b'low absolute amount of fat i eat calories).' b'' b''
