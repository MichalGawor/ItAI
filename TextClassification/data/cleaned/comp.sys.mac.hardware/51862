b'' b'just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. top three' b'contenders seem to be at&t paradyne, zyxel, and us robotics. zyxel has the' b'biggest "cult following", and can be had for under but i ignored it' b'because i need something with mac software, which will work without any' b'tweaking.' b'' b'the at&t dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. they are' b'backordered at the moment, probably because of the special price in' b'effect until may. its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two' b'modems. warning: at&t ads say that the modem comes with a mac kit (cables b'all), and has lifetime warranty. this applies *only* when you order' b'directly from paradyne! i called elektek (one of the distributors), and' b'they wanted to charge me for cable, and gave only year warranty...' b'' b'usr sportster for the mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;' b"it's only from clubmac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable" b"and don't care about the faxstf software, you can get the generic model" b'from pc outlets for b'' b"all this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a" b"motorola codex... i ended up ordering the dataport; we'll see how" b'it works in two weeks or so.' b'' b'--' b'eric behr, illinois state university, mathematics department'
