b'' b'' b'your "lite" posting for the day, from rec.humor.funny:' b'' b'' b' there is a new ice cream flavor inspired by the incident at waco.' b'' b" it's called mount caramel, it's full of nuts but you can't get it out" b' of the carton.' b'--' b'' b'' b'' b'even though i find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the' b'joke has tried and convicted the members of the bd to be a bunch of "nuts".' b'this may be a dangerous thing to do. it is my opinion that most educated' b'or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.' b'this should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time' b'will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was' b'created for. this distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.' b'that and a properly functioning press. when a sensationalism oriented press' b'portrays a group of people as "nuts" or crazies, a violation of those' b"people's civil rights seem justified. since we, as american's, have the" b'gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the' b"2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk" b'voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with' b'domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.' b'our government as it stands, must appease the public. therefore the' b"official press releases portray the bd's as fanatics who are a threat to" b'public safety. we must not prejudge people based on one sided information.' b'so far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very' b'agency that was embarrased by the bd(branch davidians sp?). it is to their' b"advantage to make the bd's as fanatical and dangerous as possible. if they" b"were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(atf) had no justification" b'what so ever of doing what they did.' b"so let's keep an open mind. jokes like above, even though it may be funny," b'may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.' b'' b'just as an aside, my understanding of u.s. vs rock island and u.s. vs dalton' b"leads me to believe that the national firearms act, which allows the fed's" b'(in this case atf) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be' b'unconstitutional since 1986.(by two federal district courts at least).' b'and since, i believe the only reason atf was involved' b'in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to' b'find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the nfa.' b'it would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly' b'unconstitutional law has resulted in deaths(law enforcement).' b'' b'' b'****************************************************************************' b'the above opinions are mine and mine only.' b"i'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions. if you must flame" b'then flame away, but a well constructed argument will be much more respected.' b'' b'rensselaer polytechnic institute n6zud/2 hl9kmt(former)' b'troy, ny b''
