b'' b'' b'there was a story a few weeks ago on a network news show about some sort' b'of fungus which supposedly attacks the bone structure and is somewhat' b'widespread in california. anybody hear anything about this one?' b'' b'' b'the only fungus i know of from california is coccidiomycosis. i' b"hadn't heard that it attacked bone. it attacks lung and if you" b'are especially unlucky, the central nervous system. nothing new' b'about it. it\'s been around for years. they call it "valley' b'fever", since it is found in the inland valleys, not on the coast.' b'' b'there is a mini-epidemic of coccidiodes that is occurring in,' b"i believe, the owen's valley/ bishop area east of the sierras." b"i don't believe there has been any great insight into the" b'increased incidence in that area. there is a low-level' b'of endemic infection in that region. many people with' b'evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have' b'serious disease.' b'' b'brian' b'' b'' b''
