b'' b'' b'first of all i have to reiterate that your terminology in describing' b'the events of are extremely "misleading". cyprus is not occupied' b'by turkish forces it was invited by turkish cypriots and "intervened"' b'' b"oh....i see...i didn't realize this..." b'' b'i think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic, and your' b'reasons for thinking the way you do. you should then distribute them' b"amongst the world's population. you see, i don't think there are many" b'people who are aware of this fact. thank you for telling us the truth.' b'' b'btw: i would start by sending your flyers to each of the un officials.' b'also, after you have distributed your flyers you might consider' b'hiding. you see, i think that once more people read what you think' b"they will have to lock you up in a mental institute; and don't think" b'they will ever let you out.' b'' b'it is a strange strange world you live in. i feel sorry for you.' b'' b'--' b'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'neophytos iacovou' b'computer science department ...!rutgers!umn-cs!iacovou'
