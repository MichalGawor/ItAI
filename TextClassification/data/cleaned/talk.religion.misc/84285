b'' b" well, stephen's annotated study of david koresh's sermon" b" doesn't bother me. it's probable that a careful review of" b' what stephen has done with obvious expenditure of thoughtful' b' effort would provide additional insight into david and his love' b' for god [may his soul rest in peace.] and whether or' b' not we agree with various points of theology therein, a review' b' would likely provide significant insight into our own love' b' for god. one thing that seems apparent from even a cursory' b" reading of koresh's message is that he was not the 'looney" b" tunes' portrayed in the fbi filtered press reports on him" b' but was quite possibly the friendly, likeable person his' b' attorney reported him to be.' b'' b'someone stated that the davidian cult should not be associated' b"with christianity. well, i read all those four postings, and i'm" b'now even more convinced that davididians are truly christian' b'in nature. but sometimes it makes sense to re-label the cult,' b'especially if the ugliness is too much to handle.' b'' b'cheers,' b'kent' b'---'
