b'' b'' b'i posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was' b'able to help me.' b'' b'the problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when i create' b"detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until" b'main_win.win receives an event. here are the relevent calls:' b'' b'main_win.win xcreatesimplewindow (mydisplay, defaultrootwindow(mydisplay),' b'myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,' b'main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);' b'xsetstandardproperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,' b'main_win.text, none, argv, argc, &myhint);' b'main_win.gc xcreategc (mydisplay, main_win.win, b'xmapraised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);' b'xmapsubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);' b'the event mask for main_win is:' b'pposition psize structurenotifymask exposuremask| keypressmask b'enterwindowmask leavewindowmask;' b'the flags are' b'pposition psize' b'' b'i then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):' b'detail_win.win xcreatesimplewindow (mydisplay, defaultrootwindow(mydisplay),' b'myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,' b'detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);' b'xsetstandardproperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,' b'detail_win.text, none, argv, argc, &myhint);' b'detail_win.gc xcreategc (mydisplay, detail_win.win, b'xmapraised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);' b"event mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask." b'' b'if anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win' b"are not received until main_win.win receives an event i'd love to hear" b'from them. other that that everything works great so there must be some' b"detail i'm overseeing." b'' b'thanks for any tips' b'--- robert' b'' b'ps: the same message was accidentally appended to the "expose events"' b'thread. sorry for any confusion caused.' b''
