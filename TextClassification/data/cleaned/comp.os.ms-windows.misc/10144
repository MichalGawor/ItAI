b'' b'' b'one of our users is having an unusual problem. if she does an alt/tab to' b'a full-screen dos program, when she goes back to windows her desktop fonts' b'have changed. if she goes back to a full-screen dos program and then goes' b"back to windows, the font has changed back to its default font. it's not" b'a major problem (everything works and the font is legible), but it is' b'annoying. does anyone have any idea why this happens. by the way, she' b'has a dec 486d2lp machine.' b'' b"if it's any consolation, i had a similar problem. as i recall, if i exited" b'from a dos session while in full-screen mode, the menu titles had changed to a' b'scrambled version of the icon title font (or something like that). it only' b'started happening after i used icontitlefacename in win.ini to change the' b'desktop font to arial. so i stopped exiting from dos sessions while in' b'full-screen mode.' b'' b"my mac used to do something similar. aren't computers weird?" b'' b'' b'------------------------------------------------------------------' b'| niwa oceanographic (taihoro nukurangi) b'| evans bay rd, greta point telephone: b'| po box kilbirnie fax: b'| wellington, new zealand b'------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b'' b''
