b'' b'' b'' b" well, it's just studying tape, frame by frame. that's all. the biggest" b' thing that you notice, however, is how bastardized the strike zone has' b' become. death to the umpires\' union! the plate is across,' b' not call the high strikes strikes, and quit calling pitches b" outside strikes they're balls!" b'' b' speaking of this wide strike zone....' b'' b" i'd sure like to see cameras placed in each major league park such that" b' an overview shot of home plate is available. cbs had this during the' b' ws, or did i just dream it.' b'' b' then again, players/managers must not be too upset with the current b' wide strike zone.' b'' b' mark pede' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'' b'wait a minute. if i read the rules right. a stike is any portion of the ball' b'over any portion of the plate.' b'' b'' b'given that the ball is in diameter. this sez that the zone width' b'is or while this is still less than the b'number given. i can forgive any ump for misjudging on an object moving' b'at to miles per hour many times not in a straight line.' b'' b'i think the umpires union has a great grasp of the rules!!!' b'' b'' b'david edwards' b''
