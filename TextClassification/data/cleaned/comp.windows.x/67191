b'' b'' b'i have an applicationshell which uses a colormap created with' b'xcreatecolormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit' b'display. when i move the cursor over the window i get the "technicolor' b'effect" which is fine. basically, my program works.' b'' b'my problem/question is: when i popup a dialogshell to prompt the user for' b'some input i want the xmndialogstyle to be set to' b'xmdialog_primary_application_modal. the result is that if my cursor is' b'over the dialogshell i get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the' b'applicationshell (or any window other than the dialogshell) i get the' b"default colormap. but i'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_" b'window of my application, i get my colormap.' b'' b'any suggestions? thanks,' b'' b'david,'
