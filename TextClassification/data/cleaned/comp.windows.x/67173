b'' b'a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation.' b'when he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear' b'with the mwm window manager running. in this configuration, x windows' b'applications (particularly xdvi) work fine. however, if he opens up a' b'second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,' b'giving the error: unable to load iso font.' b'' b'the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial' b'one references a different name in the xsession file, with prettier' b'colours and other slight changes. further investigation shows that only' b'opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, all' b'x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the' b'command line in either window. if i start the xterm with a different' b'font (using the -fn option), no problems. it would seem that the' b'default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose' b'all of its fonts. note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the' b"fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font" b'directories/hash-tables.' b'' b'other than rewriting the xterm app-defaults file to use a different' b'font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?' b'' b'more info: this is the most recent mips workstation (r4000 i believe),' b'with the most current operating system and running x11r5.' b"it is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc."
