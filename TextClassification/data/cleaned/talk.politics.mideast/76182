b'' b'' b'are you trying to say that there were no massacres in deir yassin' b'or in sabra and shatila? if so then let me tell you some good jokes:' b'' b'there is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in wwii' b'' b'palestinians just did what davidians did for fourty years and more.' b'' b'in fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.' b'' b'people die that is all. no one gets killed.' b'' b"maybe also vietamiese didn't die in vietnam war killed by american" b"napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all." b'' b'maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they' b'may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. no?' b'' b"what do you think of this isn't it stupid to say so?" b'well it is as stupid as what you said .next time you want to lie do it' b'intelligently.' b'' b'sincerely yours.' b'' b'hassan' b'' b'arab civilians did die at dir yassin. but there was no massacre. first' b'of all, the village housed many *armed* troops. secondly, the irgun' b'and stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.' b'the village was attacked only for its military significance. in fact,' b'a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before' b'the attack was to begin.' b'' b'by all rational standards, dir yassin was not a massacre. the killing' b'was unintentional. the village housed arab snipers and arab troops.' b'thus it was attacked for its military significance. it was not' b'attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.' b'' b'to even compare dir yassin, in which some or so arabs died, to the' b'holocaust is absurd. the irgun did not want to kill any civilians. the' b'village had almost inhabitants, most of whom survived.' b'' b'harry.'
