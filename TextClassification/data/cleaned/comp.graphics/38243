b'' b'i would like to know if anyone has had any luck using the upper ascii' b'characters on a sun station. i am trying to convert a fortran program to run' b'on a sun. when we write character buffers to the sun which contain char(218)' b'or char(196) or char(197) etc. we get characters on the screen but they are' b'not the characters in the standard ascii tables.' b'' b'any ideas or help will be appreciated.'
