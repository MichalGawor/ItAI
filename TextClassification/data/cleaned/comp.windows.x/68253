b'' b'' b'' b'+---------------' b' back in the days of x11.1 i did analyse the xterm code. the cursor' b" was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character. i doesn't" b" seem to be changed 'til now." b' but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via' b' xtappaddtimeout or similar b'' b'the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous, though (see also desqview/x,' b'which does this in its dos windows). do you really want xterm to wake up every' b'half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt?' b'' b"so what? i'm running emu on a mhz box. i cannot make out any" b'difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or' b'not (if you think about it a bit, a cycle of ms is a hell a lot of' b'time for even the slowest pc). since you would of course only enable' b'the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this' b'application is active anyway. to repeat it, a blinking text cursor' b'costs almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when' b'designing the xterm software.' b'' b'you are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop! what if you are on an' b'xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine? that is when the' b'load problems occur. if you had a machine with xterminals attached and' b"they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable" b'ethernet bandwidth waste.' b'' b"i'm not picking on you, just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life" b'out there besides distributed or singleuser "workstations"!' b'--' b'/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\' b'| mark a. davis lake taylor hospital norfolk, va (804)-461-5001x431 b'\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/'
