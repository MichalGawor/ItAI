b'' b'' b'' b' "muslim" in ex-yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion. in fact, not' b' all muslims in b-h are followers of islam. therefore, there do (did?)' b' exist in ex-yugoslavia "christian muslims."' b'' b"yeah! that's it! you've really outdone yourself this time nick..." b'don\'t forget the "davidian muslims"... b'' b"islam is not a race. it's a religion. you can be white, black," b'fijian or alaskan.' b'' b'this does not change the *fact* that "muslim" is a legal and political' b'term defined constitutionally in former yugoslavia, and therefore has' b'meaning and consequences entirely *independent* and *immaterial* of' b'any religious considerations.' b'' b'' b' it is a' b' civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns' b' instead of pens. the croat, muslim, and serb political leaders *all*' b' chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and' b' peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.' b'' b'terms of secession? you are, of course, joking, right nick? nobody' b'*chose* to fight. bosnia and croatia were *internationally*' b'recognized nations when the serbs attacked and started on their' b"well-documented genocide. that makes them an outside aggressor. it's" b'a simple genocide, a classical example of ethnic cleansing. there is' b'no question of civil war...' b'' b'you only wish it were so.' b'' b'more than residents of croatia and b-h have *not* accepted the' b'terms of secession which tudjman and izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon' b'them. croats and muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but' b'they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former' b'yugoslav republics of croatia and b-h.' b'' b'oh, btw, *yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was' b'destroyed by tudjman, izetbegovic, milosevic, and the international' b"community led by germany. if yugoslavia's borders could be changed" b"against its will, then certainly croatia's borders and b-h's borders" b'can be changed as well.' b'' b'as i have stated many times: the civil war in ex-yugoslavia will end' b'when the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for croatia and b-h are' b'finally agreed upon. serbs, croats, and muslims will *all* have to' b'make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.' b'' b'-nick' b'' b'' b'' b''
