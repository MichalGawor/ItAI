b'' b'| b'| |..[cancellum]...' b'| b'| b'| b'henrik] let me clearify mr. turkish;' b'henrik] armenia is not getting "itchy". she is simply letting the world know' b'henrik] that she will no longer sit there quiet and let turks get away with' b'henrik] their famous tricks. armenians do remember of the turkish invasion' b'henrik] of the greek island of cypress while the world simply watched.' b'' b'onur yalcin] it is more appropriate to address netters with their names as' b'onur yalcin] they appear in their signatures (i failed to do so since you did' b'onur yalcin] not bother to sign your posting). not only because it is the' b'onur yalcin] polite thing to do, but also to avoid addressing ladies with' b'onur yalcin] "mr.", as you have done.' b'' b'fine. please, accept my opology b'' b'onur yalcin] secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled' b'onur yalcin] as cyprus has never been greek, but rather, it has been home to' b'onur yalcin] a bi-communal society formed of greeks and turks. it seems that' b'^^^^^^^^^^^' b'onur yalcin] you know as little about the history and the demography of the' b"onur yalcin] island, as you know about the essence of turkey's" b'onur yalcin] military intervention to it under international agreements.' b'' b'bi-communal society then why did not greece invade cyprus b'' b'onur yalcin] be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in' b'onur yalcin] history and what is going on today on azerbaijani land, can only' b'onur yalcin] be drawn with the expansionist policy that armenia is now pursuing.' b'' b'buch of crap and you know it. nagarno-karabagh has always been part' b'of armenia and it was stalin who gave it to the azeris. go back and' b'review the history.' b'' b'the armenians in nagarno-karabagh are simply defending their rights' b'to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are invading their' b'teritory.' b'' b'onur yalcin] but, i could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to' b'onur yalcin] the political conduct of countries, and promulgate them in such' b'onur yalcin] terminology as "itchy-bitchy"...' b'' b'i was not the one that stated it.' b'' b'however, i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane' b'to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one' b'that happened last summer. turkey searched an american plane' b'(carrying humanitarian aid) bound to armenia.' b'' b'' b''
