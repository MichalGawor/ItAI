b'' b'hi, i have a few questions about laying out a pcb. i am using easytrax for dos' b'which is a great program. but what my question is when laying out traces what' b'thickness should they be? i am mainly designing low voltage low current boards' b'for micro controller apps. what should pad sizes be for resistors? i will be' b"turning to a commercial pcb maker to produce 1's of these boards and i was" b'wondering what is the minimum distance traces should be from each other. well' b'any info would be great. thanks.' b'anton'
