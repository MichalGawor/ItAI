b'' b': one not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...' b'' b': for our class project, we need to design and build a power supply' b': to the following specs:' b'' b': voltatge: adjustable from 1-12v' b': current: *limited* at 1a' b'' b': voltage must stay within of designated value for i from 0-1a' b': ac ripple less than mv (rms)' b'' b'to decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of' b'the limiter-current and the allowed temp-drift.' b'' b'in the first case, you can use a ube of a transistor as a voltage-reference' b'of about vdc with a temp-drift of 2mv/k. in the second case its better' b'you use a bandgap-ref and a opamp-circuit to detect the maximum-current.' b'the output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current.' b'' b'bye thomas'
