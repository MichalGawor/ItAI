b'' b'i have some color gifs which i would like to archive in a much smaller' b'size using a grayscale palette of shades. the quantization to grays' b'introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated' b'by dithering. up to now i have used xv to process the images, but now i' b'would like to automate the procedure.' b'' b"the problem is that xv can't (i think) convert images automatically, and the" b"obvious alternative pnmplus (ppmquant and pnmdither) don't even get close to" b"xv's quality. pnmdither apparently dithers in rgb, even though the images" b'are in grayscale. the dithering routine in xv seems to use the natural image' b'colors for the dither. is this or any similar routine available in the' b'public domain? if so, where?' b'--' b'niclas mattsson'
