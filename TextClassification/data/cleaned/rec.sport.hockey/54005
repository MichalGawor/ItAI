b'' b'|' b'| while watching the penguins/devils game last night, i saw the "slash" that' b'| barrasso took on the neck. this brought to mind the goaltender who had his' b"| jugular vein cut by a skate. i think he was a sabre, but i'm not positive." b'| does anyone remember/know his name? what has happened to him since? what' b'| about the player whose skate cut the goalie? name? info? has this ever' b'| happened before in a hockey game?' b'|' b'| thanks,' b'|' b'| carol' b'| go pens!' b'' b'that would be clint malarchuck. it was speculated at the time, that' b'the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end' b'of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the' b'ambulence is parked), he never would have survived. ditto, if he' b'were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on' b'standby.' b'' b"if you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood" b'there was. it was literally spurting out all over the ice, as clint' b'grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.' b'' b'amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the' b'nhl. he was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway,' b"and didn't play for too long afterward. some people speculated that" b"he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and i" b'think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.' b'he did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after' b'that, and then i believe he retired.' b'' b'anyone else?' b'' b'--' b'' b'' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'carol boudreau a.k.a. the x-terminator' b'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
