b'' b'how about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives on' b'the line day in and day out who are afraid as hell of a large black guy that' b' b'took a large amount of punishment and refused submit?' b'' b"i'm curious why you think that particular adjective is important." b'' b' black is a descriptive adjective that describes mr. king. from many' b'of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports i have seen, this adjective' b'is commonly in front of his name. i have never seen anyone complain about' b'the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner. i did not say that' b'mr. king was a no good black! i do not know mr. king and would not make this' b'ascertian without some evidence to this effect. i used it purely as a' b'descriptive adjective in the same manner than many most news people have' b'used it in the past.' b'' b'no one is questioning whether mr. king is black. the question arises' b'whether king\'s race should make police officers "afraid as hell." your' b'statement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for' b'large black guys than for just large guys in general.' b'' b"that two posts later you don't understand why anyone pointed out your use" b'of the adjective is almost as informative as your original use.' b'--' b'ted frank b'the u of c law school b'standard disclaimers
