b'' b'' b'' b'a friend of mine and i were wondering where the expression "pushing' b'the envelope" comes from. anyone out there know?' b'' b'every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/aoa/power. when' b"graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft," b'presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the' b'area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft' b"doesn't fall out of the sky. hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes" b"'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)" b"envelope'." b'' b"note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually" b'flies the airplane in those regions up to that point, all there are' b'are the theoretical predictions. hence, one of the things test pilots' b"do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the" b'correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is in' b"essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where" b'the airplane actually starts to fail to fly. note, too, that this is' b'done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally' b"carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how" b'far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,' b"such as the 'early' first flight of the f-16 during its high-speed" b'taxi tests).' b'' b"i'm sure mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about" b'this process (and then some).' b'' b'--' b'"insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live' b'in the real world." mary shafer, nasa ames dryden' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
