b'' b'' b'the problem espn2 faces is the tci-cablevision connection in the' b'merger of their prime and sportschannel networks. prime sportschannel' b'will try to wrestle away nhl from espn in the off-season. also, tci' b'and cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the' b'country with a total of million subscribers. tci-cablevision will' b'do their best that espn2 never gets off the ground successfully. and the' b"nhl's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between prime sc" b'and espn. nhl is more vital to the survival of a regionalized prime' b'sportschannel since they virtually have no national major league sports' b'contracts and only cover local nhl/nba/mlb sports teams.' b'' b'note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various sc' b'and prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local nhl owners.' b"when/if cablevision vp chuck dolan's purchase of the islanders goes" b'through, the islanders will be back solidly in the scny fold (their' b"original owners were, and they've remained due to a lucrative tv" b'contract). the flyer snyders own the philadelphia sc as well as the' b"prism pay channel. there are six teams affiliated with regional sc's," b'another half dozen affiliated with prime outlets, and other locals' b'like hts and nesn who have barter arrangements. with all this' b'cross-ownership, i was surprised that espn got the deal this' b'season!!' b'' b'gld' b'--' b'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ je me souviens b'gary l. dare'
