b'' b'yes, i have the same questions. what makes me upset is that r12 costs are' b"skyrocketing and in fact can't be bought anymore in my area. also this is yet" b'another way mechanics and dealers can rip-off customers. also i was reading' b'that the new refrigerant is not compatible with the r12 system and that it' b'would cost upto a to retrofit a car with the old r12 system.' b'although it is important to consider the environment i think the sudden ban is' b'a slap in the face for the consumer. why is it that the consumer should have' b'to pay for the retrofit? the auto companies should have seen this coming? also' b'why is it that the governments of the world were so quick in banning freon use' b'and yet so slow in banning gasoline. in my opinion gasoline is just as' b"hazardous as anything else. why can't they start proposing bans on this and" b'switch to natural gas or electric? the technology is there. hopefully some' b'chemist will come up with another alternative coolant that will be compatible' b'with the old system.' b'al h.' b'' b'several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for' b"r12. you don't hear about them because the mobile air conditioning society" b'(macs), that is, the people who stand to rake in that to per' b'retrofit per automobile, have mounted an organized campaign to squash those' b'r12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether (on very shaky' b'technical grounds, at best, on outright lies at worst).' b'' b'does this piss you off? yes? write a letter to your congressman, to' b'your senator, to the president, to the epa, and to the dot and complain.' b'' b'later,' b'--' b"chris behanna\tdod# h-d fxwg wide glide jubilee's red lady" b'disclaimer: now why would nec\t zx-11 needs a name' b'agree with any of this anyway? i was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs.'
