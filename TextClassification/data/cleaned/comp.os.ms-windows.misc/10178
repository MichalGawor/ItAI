b'' b"\ti'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare." b'\twindows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by' b'\tan errant application (my personal favorite? any one of the corel' b'\t3.0 programs). on the other hand, i have had os/2 crash randomly' b"\ta number of times, mostly just running it's own applications." b'' b'i _do_ know that ibm systems, the ps/2 56slc2, in particular, have' b'absolutely no problem with os/2--never had a "random" crash while' b"running any of my programs under os/2. in fact, i don't remember" b'_ever_ crashing.' b'' b"of course, i really don't run any os/2 programs, just the same bunch" b"of dos and windows stuff that i've always been running." b'' b'and when i had the 56slc (this is the 386slc system) running' b'dos/windows, i had only one crash, and it was consistent. ftp had a' b'tendency to crash whenever i would get large files (1mb) from' b"particularly fast clients (dtr's 150k-200k/sec), i figured out the" b"problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if i turned off the write" b'buffer, everything would work fine.' b'' b'ftp under os/2 has never locked, though. i can even format floppies' b'(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os/2.)' b'' b"\tfor instance, i'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed" b'\twp (dos) locks up my system.' b'' b"yeah, i guess i'm willing to admit that os/2 is somewhat sensitive to" b'specific hardware. wp51 for dos works perfectly fine on my slc2...' b'' b'\tplease explain. the only time i wait on anything under windows is' b"\twhen i'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even" b'\tthen, not long--i get to pages dumped to the printman per' b"\tminute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing" b'' b'well, i save all my personal files to floppy, and when i did that' b'under windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.' b'' b'i also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the' b'tasking options on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal' b'computation in the background.' b'' b' and not being able to address your memory better than dos,' b'' b'\tnot sure what you mean here.' b'' b"the idea is that os/2's dos sessions can see more memory than windows" b'dos sessions. i let xpl (a shareware calculus program) see around' b'720kb of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me do bigger symbolic' b'manipulations than is possible under straight dos (where it would see' b'around 610kb of conventional ram.). i also found it really handy for' b'my _own_ dos-based programs, which, without any re-writing, could now' b'handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. of course,' b'the point is now moot, since the os/2 programs i now write simply' b'_never_ run into memory limitations. i never programmed for windows,' b"so i don't have much of a comparison here, though...."
