b'' b'' b'' b"today finally, if israel wants peace, why can't it declare what" b'it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a' b'base for negotiations? having all the above facts in mind, one' b'cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism, as a' b'number of wars have proved b'' b'oh yeah, israel was really ready to "expand its borders" on the holiest day' b'of the year (yom kippur) when the arabs attacked in oh wait, you' b'chose to omit that war...perhaps because it supports the exact' b"opposite to the point you are trying to make? i don't think that it's" b'because it was the war that hit israel the hardest. also, in it was' b'egypt, not israel who kicked out the un force. in it was the arabs' b'who refused to accept the existance of israel based on the borders set' b'by the united nations. in egypt closed off the red sea to israeli' b'shipping, a clear antagonistic act. and in the attack was a response' b'to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the golan' b'heights. children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and israel' b'finally retaliated. nowhere do i see a war that israel started so that' b'the borders could be expanded.' b'' b'steve' b'--' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'| <<my opinions are not associated with anything, including my head.
