b'' b'on the question, "does god hear the prayers of sinners?" we need to' b'distinguish.' b'if we say that he never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we' b'make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than centuries' b'ago.' b'but if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone' b'who says, "lord, i want you to do this for me, but don\'t expect me' b'to change my way of life," that is a different matter.' b'' b"i have no doubt that god hears everybody's prayers." b'however, he does things his way, i.e. things will happen' b'only if it is his will.' b'' b'now if the question really is "does god grant everybody\'s wishes b"then you'll get a brutal shot of reality similar to when you didn't" b'get that toy you wanted for christmas. you just cannot expect' b'to get everything you want in this world.' b'' b'--' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b"mark ashley |disclaimer: my opinions. not harris'" b'the lost los angelino
