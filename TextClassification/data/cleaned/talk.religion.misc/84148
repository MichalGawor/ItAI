b'' b'' b'' b'#writes:' b"# just thought i'd clear up a few of the murky areas..." b'#' b'#actually, after surviving being driven out of nauvoo, and later carthage,' b'#the mormons did fortify utah. they still arm themselves to "defend the' b'#faith", and stockpile food as well. they have been involved in quite a' b'#lot of illegal activity including multiple (and often underage) wives' b'#for the leaders a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their' b'#sect. the parallels between koresh and joseph smith are striking.' b'# b'' b'by "they," you mean the leaders of the lds church? i grant you that when' b'joseph smith was still alive, plenty of "accusations" were filed, most of' b'which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.' b'i have studied lds history for years now, and i have yet to see prove' b'that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: "illegal activities."' b'plural marriage, yes, but your charge of "underage" wives sounds like it' b'could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral' b'standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it' b'appears, those of david koresh.' b'' b'# joseph smith started the sect. after he and his brother hyram' b'#were murdered in a nauvoo, il. jail cell, church membership split over' b'#who to follow. initially, smith was considered a prophet (just like' b'#mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering muslims consider' b"#christ to be a prophet the same as jews, i'm led to understand. make" b"#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in smith). the" b'' b'and neither did he claim he was. as the church reflects the moral' b'aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of joseph smith), i have' b'nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only "crime"' b'was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision... many have tried' b'to explain the "smith phenomenon" away, but the bold presence of an b"million member strong church stands as a witness that joseph smith's" b'testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.' b'' b'#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed' b'#down father to son. after joseph smith died, his son was only' b'#entering his teens. brigham young and a few others claimed to have' b'#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death. the' b"#council of twelve, the church governing body, wasn't of much help" b'#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.' b'#brigham young took his followers to salt lake. the rest waited' b'#for smith jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership. the other' b'#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like mike dukakis. b'' b'"the rest" were apostates and excommunicated members of the church,' b'while the great majority of the membership, the twelve, and the various' b'auxiliary organizations, chose to accept brigham young as the new' b'prophet and leader of the church. if you knew your lds scriptures and' b'doctrine, you would have known that brigham young was the first in' b"line to fill the prophet joseph smith's vacancy: he was the senior" b'apostle in the quorum, and various comments made by joseph indicated' b'that it was brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the west.' b'' b'other rightful "heirs" were either dead (hyrum smith) or excommunicated' b'(oliver cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,' b'joseph smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty' b'land beyond the boundaries of the united states (at that time). this' b'"rekhabite" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated' b'by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.' b'' b'granted, a couple of "do-it-yourselfers" stayed behind, unwilling to' b'sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but' b'this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat. the' b'church benefitted from this purification process: they became even' b'more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.' b'' b'# both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,' b'#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at' b'#least owned weapons. there is little evidence that they were a' b'#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than' b'#face large-scale opposition. brigham young, having suffered a' b'#great deal getting to salt lake, seems to have been quite' b'#justified in making military training a good thing. remember,' b'#this was far beyond where even the us army went, and these people' b'#had nobody to turn to save themselves.' b'#' b'# just a little context to put this all in perspective.' b'' b'btw, since when is the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (one of' b'the largest denominations in the country) a "sect"??? it didn\'t "splinter"' b'from any other religion, as did say, the southern baptists or methodists.' b'' b'#so what did the mormons get? it seems that j. edgar hoover was very' b"#impressed with the way they kept secrets.
