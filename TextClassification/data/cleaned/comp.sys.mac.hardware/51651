b'' b'i remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external' b'syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a centris.' b'. i was going to do that with my but had a couple of questions. my' b'pli 80m syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the' b'outside of the case. where do i connect this switch?? can the computer just' b'"tell" with internal drives?' b'i noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (i' b"didn't look closely, but i seem to recall it laying over the ram that's" b'soldered onto the motherboard? would that cause problems?' b'one last question! is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?' b"the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the" b"drive's panel is the same size as the spotsbm clone's cases). should i just" b'cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?' b'' b'ans are welcomed! thanks!' b'keith moffatt'
