b'' b'| just a couple of questions for the pro-israeli lobby out there:' b'|' b"| is israel's occupation of southern lebanon temporary? for mr." b'| stein: i am working on a proof for you that israel is diverting' b'| water to the jordan river (away from lebanese territory).' b'' b'yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages' b'of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.' b'currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light' b'and armored patrols. no permanent installations have been' b'built in the area, nor are any planned.' b'' b'as to the prodigal "water question", you can continue to waste' b'your time looking for non-existent proof, or you can accept the' b'testimony of people here, some lebanese, who have acknowledged' b'that they know of no evidence for these allegations.' b'' b"| is israel's occupation of the west bank, gaza, and golan" b'| temporary? if so (for those of you who support it), why were so' b'| many settlers moved into the territories? if it is not temporary,' b"| let's hear it." b'' b'it depends which of those territories you refer to.' b'in general, settlers were moved into the territories because' b'at the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the' b"logical move. this is not to say that views don't change" b'or that mistakes are not made. currently, i would say that' b'the only "disputed territory" that does not appear to be temporary' b'is that of eastern and northern jerusalem.' b'' b'| steve' b'|' b'' b'--' b'shai guday stealth bombers,' b'os software engineer b'thinking machines corp. |\tthe winged ninjas of the skies.' b'cambridge, ma
