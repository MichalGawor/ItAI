b'' b'' b'i have a sx and i recently added a scsi drive to my system using an' b'adaptec (non busmastering) controller. yesterday i ran coretest to' b'find out drive performance and these are the values i got' b'' b'seagate meg: 875.1kb/sec\t14.5ms avg seek 3.7ms track to track' b'quantum meg scsi: kb/sec avg seek track to track.' b'' b"first off all are these good results? i don't know what typical values" b'are.' b'' b'those are pretty typical, i believe.' b'' b"what i'm wondering now is the following. my swap file is currently on the" b'ide. i could move it to the scsi which is faster, but then i would not' b'be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. so on' b'which drive should i put my swap file to get best results? is there a swap' b'file speed test program out there?' b'' b'keep the swap file on the ide. 32-bit access is worth a fair amount more' b'than b''
