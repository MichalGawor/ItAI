b'' b'' b'for those of you who might be familiar with insight distribution' b'network, inc. and their multimedia kits:' b'' b"i'm seriously considering buying the insight talon ta-2000 mm kit, which" b'is bundled with the cd-rom drive with 265-280ms access time, 300kb dtr,' b'multispin, multi-session photo cd capability, etc., and with the pas-16' b'sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with insight, you know the kit' b'i mean). i believe the drive is either a texel (265ms) or an nec' b'(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the' b"bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight" b'answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of oem!).' b'' b'other questions:' b'' b'- excuse my ignorance, but is "texel" a reputable maker in the cd-rom' b'market? or do you think nec is the better drive?' b'' b'- bottom line: is this kit worth the money? (currently, for the' b'ta-1000, and for the ta-2000)' b'' b'alternatively, i was thinking that the ta-2000 might be overkill for my' b'uses (however, i *do* want full multimedia capabilities, photo cd stuff,' b'educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end' b'ta-1000 kit and using the difference (around to get something' b'else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.' b'' b'basically, i would just like to hear from those who have actually used' b'these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably' b'directly to the email address below.' b'' b'thanks,' b'' b'koji' b'' b'2' b'_/' b'~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/ b'| koji kodama b'| by nippon motorola ltd. b'| b'| note: the opinions expressed herein b'| are mine, and do not reflect the opinions b'| |or policies of motorola inc. or its affiliates.|' b'~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' b'_/_/_/'
