b'' b'|' b'| i am developing an x (xt,xm) application that will include a graphics window' b'| of some sort with moving symbols among other things. a pure x application' b'| could be implemented with motif widgets, one of which would be an' b'| xmdrawingarea for drawing with xlib. but i would like to take advantage of' b"| the graphics library (gl) available on our ibm rs/6000 (sgi's gl i believe)." b'|' b'| is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program?' b'| can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me' b'| with xopenwindow?' b'' b'there is a widget already defined for gl. it is the glxmdraw (motif) or' b'glxdraw (athena) widget. it is similar to a xmdrawingarea, except that it' b'allows you to use gl calls to render into the window. look at glxlink,' b'glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.' b'' b'| i have never used gl before, but the doc on gl winopen() says that the first' b'| time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server. also, most of' b'| the gl calls do not require a display or gc, unlike most x calls. from this' b'| initial information it appears that x and gl cannot be mixed easily. is this' b'| true?' b'' b'the glxmdraw widget works pretty well. opengl will be an improvement.' b'' b'| does pex (graphigs?) have the same functionality of gl?' b'' b'i think gl is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but' b"that's just an opinion. mileage may vary." b'' b'' b'--' b'larry d. pyeatt the views expressed here are not' b'voice that i know of with the possible' b'exception of myself.'
