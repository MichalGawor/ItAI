b'' b' \trecently, i saw an ad for the altima which says that it is the' b' best seller for the past months, is that true?' b' b'' b' i too was puzzled by this obvious untruth. what i think is going on is that' b' nissan claims that the altima is "the best selling new car namelplate in' b' the us" (i think i have this near verbatim). lee iaccoca\'s statistics' b' dept. would have been proud of that sentence. what they mean, i think, is' b' that of all "totally new models", i.e. cars never sold before in any' b' form, the altima is the best seller, thereby eliminating accord, taurus' b' etc.' b'this is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin' b'theirs.... implying that the nissan quest/ murcury villager are out-selling' b'the chrysler mini-vans.... not only is this not true at all, but it was a stupid' b'claim to make... the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the' b"vans. kind of a bold statement to make when you haven't even sold one yet, eh?" b'' b'' b'and i thought buick and oldsmobile where bad. shame on you nissan and' b'mercury!' b'' b' any other interpretations?' b'' b'' b' craig' b' \t does anyone has anyhting regarding the of cars sold for the' b' past months?' b' b' b' b' tony' b'' b''
