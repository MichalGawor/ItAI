b'' b'i am interested in finding out why people become' b'atheists after having believed in some god/god.' b"in conversing with them on other groups, i've" b"often sensed anger or hostility. though i don't" b'mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile,' b'it does seem to be one motivation for giving up' b'faith. thus, some atheism might result from' b'broken-ness.' b'' b'this is condescending at best and a slightly disquised ad hominem' b'attack. this attitude on the part of many theists, especially the' b'vocal ones, is one reason for the hostility you sense. how do you' b'like it when atheists say that people turn to religion out of' b'immature emotionalism?' b'' b"i wouldn't and don't. i thought i did a pretty good job of" b'qualifying my statement, but apparently some people' b'misinterpreted my intentions. i apologize for my part in' b'communicating any confusion. my intent was more to' b'stir up discussion rather than judge. it seems to' b'have worked.' b'' b'[rest of post noted by the way, i did not originally post this to' b"alt.atheism. if it got there, i don't know how it did.]" b'' b'--' b'filipp sapienza' b'department of technology services' b'university of michigan hospitals surgery'
