b'' b'just a quick comment. as a baptist clergyperson, i find the idea' b'of such a "baptism" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and' b'they seldom are regarding religion) offensive. the pastor here seems' b'to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the' b'ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.' b'' b'we do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing' b'the word is likely to be a convert. if in fact the grace of god might' b'work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or' b'two.' b'' b'baptist believe in regenerate membership. did this church include these' b'half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? or do they' b'somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose?' b'' b'this kind of "evangelism" is certainly not baptist, and probably not' b'very christian, either.' b''
