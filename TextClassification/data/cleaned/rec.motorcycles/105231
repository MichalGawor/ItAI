b'' b"i need help getting my zx-11 (c3) to behave. i've managed to get" b"the front suspension to be very happy, but the rear sucks. i can't" b'do anything with it to make it feel ok. the bike is very stable' b'through the corners (i think because i have the front just right),' b'but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous. it feels' b"like it actually amplifies the bumps. and the damping doesn't seem" b'to do anything in real-life, although you can tell the difference' b"when the bike isn't moving. i've tried cm of sag (from" b"completeley unloaded), but i don't know which way to go. has anyone" b'gotten the rear of this bike comfortable? and if so, what kind of' b'settings (esp. what sag) did you use. i like to corner, but i also' b'would like my kidneys to remain intact. this thing makes the new' b'zx-7 feel comfy....' b'' b''
