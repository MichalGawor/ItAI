b'' b'' b'i somewhat agree with u. however, what it comes to (theist) religion,' b"it's a different matter. that's because religion is like a drug, once u" b"use it, it's very difficult to get out of it. that's because in" b'order to experience a religion, u necessarily have to have blind faith,' b"and once u have the blind faith, it's very diffcult for you to reason" b'yourself back to atheism again.' b"therefore, it's unreasonable to ask people to try religion in order to" b'judge it. it\'s like asking people to "try dying to find out what' b'death is like".' b'' b"well now, we can't judge death until we are dead right? so, why should" b'we judge religion without having experienced it? people have said that' b'religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc.,' b"but i don't totally agree with this. of course, we cannot really say" b'how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion,' b'but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.' b'' b'so basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for' b'a given individual, or even for a general population. we can say that' b'it is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to use' b'religion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you state' b'above).' b'' b'keith'
