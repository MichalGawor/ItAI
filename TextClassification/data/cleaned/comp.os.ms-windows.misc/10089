b'' b'' b' this may be an faq (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but i' b' am getting frustrated and looking for help.' b'' b' i am running win with ndw on a 486sx with meg of memory and a' b' meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my' b' applications are not giving back system resources when i close them.' b'' b' i am aware this is a known problem; what i am looking for are some' b' suggestions of what i might do to mitigate it.' b'' b' what software is the culprit? win ndw, my applications? are' b' some modes of win (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at' b' plugging this leak?' b'' b"it's the applications that do this. unfortunately, even the applets" b"that ship with win31 seem to have this problem (i've seen it in" b'solitaire, for example).' b'' b' are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?' b'' b"none that i know of. if an application doesn't give back the" b'resources, they are lost and gone forever, pending a restart of' b'windows.' b'' b' do people know of patches or third party software that help with' b' this? seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a' b' great market for a third party memory company like qemm.' b'' b"if the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them" b"don't), there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do" b'about it.' b'' b' if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak subside? (i was' b' hoping that ndw would have plugged this, but it seems no different' b' than in how it deals with memory and resources.)' b'' b'no. this is a problem with the applications, usually.' b'' b' when i am writing vb code are there things i can do to make it less' b' likely my code will eat resources?' b'' b'there are books written on this one. in general, just be sure to free' b'up everything that you ask for before you exit. unfortunately, i' b'understand that vb will *internally* lose resources for you, so' b"there's no way to avoid this entirely." b'' b" any other suggestions that i don't know enough to ask for" b' specifically?' b'' b' thanks for your help. as this is a common problem and i have seen only' b' a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who' b' would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending' b' me email.' b'' b"there's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until ms manages" b'to come up with an os that will do garbage collection or something on' b'the resource pool.' b'' b'--' b'"insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live' b'in the real world." mary shafer, nasa ames dryden' b'------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
