b'' b' services we offered was an engine cleaning (remove all that oil before you' b' sell the car... unfortunately, we did not have a high pressure' b' washer so we would use one several miles from the shop. on more than one' b' occasion after washing the engine, it would not start as water would have' b' gotten under the distributor (i would put a plastic bag around it to try and' b' minimize this), around the spark plug wires, etc and it would be nearly' b' impossible to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag. the usual' b" solution was to carry a can of wd-40, and when the car wouldn't start to spray" b' all the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time.' b'' b'this definately gets the car going, but... wd-40 is highly flammable. explosive' b'even in the right conditions, like a vapour sealed inside a distributor for' b'eg. and contact points tend to arc a tiny bit b'' b'i once saw the alternator/points cover blow completely off a motorcycle after' b'it had been restored to life with wd-40... fun to watch' b'(it was a honda mr-50 minibike and the cover is only held on by large rubber' b"grommet, so it wasn't really a big blast.)" b'graham b' b'ps as a more serious aside, it is apparently also conductive, so it is best' b'to exercise caution with it around mains wiring.' b''
