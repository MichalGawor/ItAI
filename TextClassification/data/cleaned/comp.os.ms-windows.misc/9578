b'' b'hi,' b'have you used mac system 6.x or 7.x? if the answer is positive, you would' b'know if ms-windows is a "mature" os.' b'' b'days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real os. i can see why' b'they have such question. ms-windows confuses many people. microsoft' b'simulated mac, but it did a lousy job. for example:' b'' b'(1) you can not create hierarchy groups. there is no way to create a group' b'in a group. (if you know how, please tell me.)' b'(2) too many system parameters to take care of.' b"(3) uncomplete documentation. it's not easy to find the reason why causes" b'an unpredictable error.' b'(4) group deleting/file deleting' b'after deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.' b'but if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full' b'of nonsense files.' b'(5) share problem' b'once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some' b'language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. you just' b'can not open or save the program if it is loaded. it makes sense to' b'prevent from saving, but not opening.' b'' b'microsoft try to compromise between dos and windows, but they just make' b'ms-windows a graphical dos with capacity doing mutiple dos jobs;' b'the worst thing is they complicate the environment. the orginal purpose' b'of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make pc easier' b'to use.' b'' b"it's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if microsoft want to" b'keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more' b'carefully before products distribute.' b'' b'no flame, please.' b'' b'jesse' b'' b''
