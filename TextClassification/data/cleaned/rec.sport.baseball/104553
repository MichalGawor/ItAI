b'' b'' b' actually, i kind of liked the abott trade. we did trade the rookie of' b'the year, snow, but with don mattingly at first for another years, why' b'bother.' b'' b"i'd be willing to make two wagers:" b"1) snow doesn't win roy." b'2) mattingly is out of baseball within five years.' b'' b"i'm skeptical of the first, because i don't think snow is that good a" b'player, and he is on a losing team.' b'' b"i'm skeptical of the second because of his back. mattingly is this" b'year, and how many players play until they are not too many, and' b"most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were b'' b"could be wrong on either or both, but i think that's the smart way to" b'bet...' b'' b'cheers,' b'-valentine'
