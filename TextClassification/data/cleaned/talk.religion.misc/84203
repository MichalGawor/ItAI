b'' b'...' b'give me a break! what fireman should have to deal with a blaze like that' b'and get shot at at the same time.' b'' b'nearly all of them. witness la firemen are among our real' b'heroes most of the time. i wonder when they were actually' b'aasked to come, or if they found out about the fire over the' b'tv b'' b'' b'shot at by whom? prove it!' b'' b'' b"these people were breaking the law. i agree these weren't the best tactics," b'' b'when "law" replaces "justice" the system is dying or dead.' b'note that we had a small revolution years ago on this' b'point.' b'' b'they probably should have backed off, pulled the perimeter way back, and let' b'them sit there with no media attention until they decided to come out. the' b'only other alternative i see would have been to send in a couple of special' b'forces guys to capture or assassinate koresh. but remember, these fruit-' b'' b'or perhaps just wait.' b'or maybeeven send in a few agents who are christian to' b'sit down and pray outside the line? try affinity' b'rather than subversion?' b'' b'' b'loops were putting their lives on the lines voluntarily. why should' b'' b'chuckle. so would you if someone points a gun at you.' b'at that point you can die or live; and if living means' b'stayng in a building to keep badge carrying nuts off your' b'kids, i suspect you might as well.' b'' b'both sides were wrong.' b'' b'law-abiding citizens have to put themselves in any more danger than necessary' b'when dealing with a nut? look at the man who jumped out of his bradley to' b'grab a flaming women who was running back into the building. yeah, i would' b"have to say they were trying to save those people. i don't think i would" b"risk my life that much to save someone that stupid that obviously didn't" b'even want to be saved.' b'' b"try again: go see the movie sophie's choice." b'grow up.' b'' b'' b'-tim' b'' b'royc'
