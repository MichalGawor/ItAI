b'' b"i don't know if anyone knows about this topic: electrical heart" b'failure. one of my friends has had to go to the doctor because' b'he had chest pains. the doc said it was arythmia. so he had to' b'go to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated. his' b'doctors said that he could die from it, and the medication caused' b'cancer that he was taking). well, i suggested that he run, excersize' b'and eat more, he is very skinny) but he says that has nothing' b'to do with it. does anyone know what causes arythmia and how' b'it can be treated?' b'thanks' b''
