b'' b'' b' well, the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits' b' if the oppertunity presented itself?' b'' b' i reckon *any* *man* would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a' b' huge variety of willing partners.' b'' b'if true, and if gays were the same as straights except' b'for sexual preference, i would imagine that gays would' b'have much less sex than straights because the available' b'pool for dates is less than one-tenth what it is for' b'straights. somebody correct (flame) me please!' b'' b'i *cannot* *believe* i am posting in this thread, but what' b'the hell, he asked for it.' b'' b'i had sort of the same reaction myself when i was first realizing' b'i was bi. "so what, of everyone else is straight, i\'d never' b'end up with a guy anyway." as several people on soc.bi pointed' b'out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships' b'or just for sex) in primarily straight circles. nowadays with gay' b'culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily' b'find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so' b"choose. (about half my friends are bi, and that's just from" b'hanging out in the science fiction club and going to ucbu once a' b"week, it's not as if i have to go out of my way and hang out in" b'bars or something.)' b'' b'so the available pool for dates can be the same size. unless of' b"course you're trying to date a random sample of the us population." b'' b"as for promiscuity, i've traded email with clayton on the topic," b"and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males" b"are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're" b"closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship." b'or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender' b"roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've" b"*all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to" b'be more sex. or that what\'s "dysfunctional", what\'s "screwed up"' b"is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what" b'encourages deviant behavior in gay males.' b'' b"(also note that just because someone's had sex partners" b"doesn't mean they're promiscuous. yes, it sounds ridiculous," b"but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily" b'closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with' b'strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships,' b'and be monogamous or nearly so...)' b'' b'' b'-- b'those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music anon b'b0h7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-ps6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+n0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+'
