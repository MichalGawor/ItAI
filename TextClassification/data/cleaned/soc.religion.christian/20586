b'' b'' b" \tbut recently i read peter brown's _body and society_. it is very" b' well researched, and well written. but is raises some very upsetting' b" questions. the early christians were weird even more so than today's" b' carzy fundies. they had odd views on sex, odder views on the body,' b' totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable' b' views about other human beings.' b'' b'if possible (last i heard, it was out of print but they were considering' b"reprinting) read barbara hambly's _search the seven hills_. it is" b'historical fiction, set in rome at the time of the early church. she' b'captures the weirdness of the early christians and yet gives glimpses of' b'the holiness too. some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the' b'context of the society they lived in. i found it a remarkably positive' b'view of christianity considering that the author is not a christian' b'herself. another plus is that each chapter begins with an' b'original-source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious' b'research.' b''
