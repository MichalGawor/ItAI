b'' b"kevin mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off brett saberhagen plated" b'pitch runner cesar hernandez to give the reds a come-from-behind victory over' b'new york. hernandez ran for pinch-hitter cecil espy, who got the inning started' b'with a solid single to right, moved to second on "bob" kelly\'s infield sneaker' b"down the third-base line, and to third on jeff branson's well-placed bunt--a" b'rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless reds offense.' b'' b'cincinnati trailed after starter tim pugh blinked in the fifth. he had only' b'given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double' b'by vince coleman. coleman was left stranded at third by bobby bonilla after' b'joe orselak popped to short. orselak was pinch-hitting for eddie murray who' b'argued plate umpire kellogg\'s inside strike by "drawing the line" (really, he' b'should know better than that). murray, and later manager jeff torborg ended up getting' b'tossed.' b'' b"the mets' fifth started with a howard johnson's first-pitch homer. pugh must" b"have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by jeff kent's" b'single, then a ryan thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by mitchell' b"and turned into a rbi triple. catcher hundley's grounder to the drawn-in branson" b'failed to bring thompson in, then the play of the game occured:' b'' b'saberhagen was due up, so reds pitching coach larry rothschild met with the infield' b'to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze. they called it perfectly:' b"thompson was hung out to dry after pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended." b"(isn't the national league great??)" b'' b"the reds picked up runs in the seventh to knot up the game. after barry larkin's" b'ground out, mitchell, chris sabo, and randy milligan got back-to-back-to-back' b'singles--the third scoring mitchell. reggie sanders then plated sabo with a long' b'fly to center. a double by oliver might have scored runner dan wilson, but' b'third base coach dave bristol threw up the stop sign too late--wilson himself was' b'hung out to dry killing the reds rally.' b'' b'rob dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily. with two outs and a runner' b'on second bonilla came to the plate and all i could think of was the sunday game' b"in late august last year when bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on" b"dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for cinci's season. bonilla ended" b'up walking, and hojo flied out to left to give the reds their first win in a' b'week, and earned dibble his third save in as many opportunities. the win went' b'to steve foster who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings' b"work, striking out three. saberhagen got the loss--though i'm a bit" b"surprised he even pitched in the eighth. i'll take it, though." b'' b'the reds are now still the worst team in baseball with the royals victory' b'today. the mets are b'' b'' b'the line:' b'' b'new
