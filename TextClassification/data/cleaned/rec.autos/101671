b'' b'' b'in your experience, how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning' b'will do much more good than just using detergent gas. while i' b'agree that a clogged fuel injector would darken my day, how clogged' b'do they get, and is a good price (or can i do it myself by buying' b'a can of (what?) and doing what?' b'' b'' b'a "fuel injector cleaning" at the dealer is probably little more than' b'them opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner,' b'and sending you on your merry way poorer. go to kmart and buy the' b'cleaner yourself for b'' b"personally, i wouldn't use the product from kmart. i knew about" b"this previously, but this past weekend on pbs's motorweek pat goss" b'(their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends' b'not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).' b'' b'supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture' b'from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors. and although the' b'others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber' b"components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well" b'with water to help remove it from the fuel system.' b'' b'i use a product recommended by vw called 44k (by bg products, inc.).' b'it cost more about but it is supposed to do the job without' b'the potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to' b"last from 2k to 4k miles. i have also used chevron's techtrolene (sp?)." b'' b"i can't say that i have noticed any difference using either, since i" b'only use these product as a preventative maintenance item.' b'' b'' b"just because you dealer sez you need it, don't mean it's necessarily so." b'be suspicious.' b'' b'jim grey' b'' b'.' b'/' b'larry b'_____ b'----------- b'/ b'| b'/___ ====oo' b'\\ b'- 16v b'' b'' b'---------------- fahrvergnugen forever! b'the fact that i need to explain it to you indicates' b"that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!" b'------------------------------------------------------------'
