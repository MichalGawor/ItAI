b'' b'my son is considering the purchase of a mgb, which has been substantially' b"restored. the odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual" b"mileage. the engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the" b'restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses. he plans to do vacuum and' b'compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine. the body' b'and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,' b'front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.' b'the paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by' b'a wind-blown car cover. it seemed to handle ok, except for soft front shocks.' b'questions:' b'' b'are there problem areas common to mgbs we should check out?' b'' b'the brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way' b'of braking action?' b'' b'it seemed to be "doggy" when accelerating from a stop. what should we expect' b'it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?' b'' b'the top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps. the weather' b'was cold. should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever' b'shrunk?' b'' b'is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?' b'' b'given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?' b'' b'gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry. while my brother once owned' b"an xk120 jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars. any help with" b'these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be' b'appreciated.' b'' b'phil truesdale' b''
