b'' b'reminding us that advertising is not done on internet:' b'' b'as a matter of fact d.j., it does make a difference.' b'almost a half million new users joined the internet last year,' b'many of them are commercial businesses. the ban on commercial' b'use of internet is no more.' b'' b'jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial' b'purposes and advertising in newsgroups. business communication is' b'okay. advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet' b'who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.' b'' b'those of us who pay for internet access are constrained only' b'by our innate good taste and no have no "administrator" to' b'guide(?) us.' b'' b'i suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not' b"in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention" b"it didn't want. you may belong to the public library, but that" b"doesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb" b'the other patrons.' b'' b"you're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many" b'academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which' b'they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business' b'advertising) follow. there are secret masters here, just like' b"everywhere else. they're not as obvious as the ones on prodigy, but" b"they're here." b'' b'no doubt at some point the internet, like everything else, will become' b'grotty enough to carry advertising. at that time i hope it is' b'confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like' b'misc.writing.' b'' b'' b'elizabeth willey'
