b'' b'' b'hi! everyone,' b'' b'since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from' b'4 points, i suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse' b'from its offset. for example, given points on the offset, can you find' b'the original ellipse analytically?' b'' b'i spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,' b'but i failed. under the pressure, i had to use other method nonlinear' b'programming technique to deal with this problem approximately.' b'' b'any ideas will be greatly appreciated. please post here, let the others' b'share our interests.' b'' b'yeh' b'usc'
