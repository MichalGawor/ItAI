b'' b'' b' i friend of mine installed dos6 at work and is hooked up to a novell' b" network, running netware v.3.11. the problem he's having is that the" b" doublespace program is using drive 'h' as the swap drive, which is" b' confliting with the networks mapped drives.' b'' b' is there switch to place the swap drive to someother drive?' b' please e-mail....thanks a bunch!!' b' b' mahbub' b'' b'determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your' b'config.sys if you are using w4ww you might want to go a couple of drives higher' b'to give you some shared drive space. reboot and novell will set its first' b'drive one above the lastdrive in config.sys. you might have to remap some' b'of your novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives. make' b'sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto novell is set' b'to the correct drive (one above the lastdrive setting in the config.sys file).' b''
