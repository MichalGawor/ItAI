b'' b'' b'' b'' b"diaspora 'a cancer'" b'------------------- by julian kossoff and lindsay schusman in:' b'jewish chronicle, london, dec. b'' b'leading israeli author and cultural commentator, a.b. yehoshua,' b'launched a ferocious attack on diaspora jewry at a zionist youth' b'council meeting in north london, last week.' b'' b'the diaspora, he claimed, "was the cancer connected to the main' b'tissue of the jewish people". he was scathing about its failure to' b'act before the holocaust.' b'' b"he said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had" b'ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed' b'zionism. consequently, he considered the holocaust, "the failure' b'of judaism".' b'' b'his talk, entitled "diaspora: a neurotic solution", covered b'years of jewish history.' b'' b"mr. yehoshua's other targets included soviet jews who were, he" b'said "not staying [in israel], but running [away]", and all jews' b'outside israel "who were using other people\'s countries like' b'hotels".' b'' b'the only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was' b'immoral, because it looked to israel for its identity but lived' b'elsewhere.' b'' b'worse, it threatened israel itself, creating a distraction for her' b'citizens, who were leaving by the thousands.' b'' b'mr. yehoshua, who described himself as "a soldier for aliyah",' b'ended by calling for the creation of a new "total jew", living in' b'israel.' b'' b'earlier, speaking at a meeting of jewish students on the' b'difficulties of forging a national identity in israeli literature,' b'mr. yehoshua claimed that israeli writers were paralyzed by the' b"country's political situation." b'' b"he said israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital" b'source of inspiration. today, israeli writers avoided writing' b'directly about the arab-israeli conflict. no major work had been' b'produced about the intifada.' b'' b'instead, writers were tackling themes such as jewish identity,' b'emigration from israel and personal and family issues.' b'' b'mr. yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the' b'israeli political situation. he could no longer step into an' b'israeli arab\'s shoes and portray him as a real "flesh and blood' b'character".' b'' b'he claimed that after years of statehood, the problem of' b'israeli identity had not been solved. he said jews remained too' b'pre-occupied with the borders of identity between jew and non-jew,' b'and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.' b'' b'jewish values in israel embraced every aspect of daily life,' b'unlike in the diaspora, where jews had no responsibility for the' b'country they lived in, he said.' b'' b'he warned that modern hebrew, a unifying force for the jewish' b'people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in' b'literary circles. it faced fierce competition from the english' b'language.' b'' b'-------------------------------------------------------------------------' b'' b''
